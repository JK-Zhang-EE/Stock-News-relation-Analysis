Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is among the companies the SEC is pressing to disclose more revenue information to investors, according to WSJ sources.The SEC wants Amazon to disclose how much of its revenue comes from Amazon Prime customers.

The project, being built by the Gotham Organization, will have more than 1,000 units, with about 80% designated for affordable housing.
For Goldman, advantages include tax breaks intended to attract investment into low-income areas labeled ""opportunity zones."" Investors that build in these zones can defer taxes on past capital gains and avoid them on future profits from their projects.
Much of Long Island City is located in such a zone.
Also Amazon's move closeby reduces some of the risk in investing in the area and helps to mitigate the possibility that the overall economy will sag by the time the complex gets built.

 Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has joined the bidding for the 22 regional sports networks that Disney (NYSE:DIS) is divesting as part of its $71B purchase of media assets from Fox (FOX, FOXA), CNBC says. That includes the YES Network, where the retail/tech giant is joining Blackstone (NYSE:BX), a sovereign wealth fund and the New York Yankees in the bidding. Fox hasn't submitted a bid this round, David Faber says, though they could join in the second round. The prospect's out there that Fox could win the nets back at a discount, though healthy bid participation makes that more unlikely. 
Updated: At the 10:00 hour, AMZN is down 3.5%; DIS -1.7%; FOX -0.5%; FOXA -0.4%. 
Updated 10:14 a.m.: CNBC adds that bids for the nets came in from Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), KKR, Blackstone, Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) and Tegna (NYSE:TGNA). The second round of bids is expected by the end of the year.  ",2018-11-20

Amazon (AMZN -4.3%) continues to use open-source software to build out AWS despite tensions with the open-source community, according to The Information.
AWS is reportedly developing two new cloud services based on popular database MongoDB (MDB -12%) and real-time data software Apache Kafka.
Open-source software is free to use with the expectation that the user will contribute code back to the community.
Last month, MongoDB changed its licensing to put the Community Server software under a SSPL license, which lets cloud providers offer MongoDB as a service but only if they open source all of the related code or create a commercial agreement.
AWS will host its re:Invent cloud conference next week in Las Vegas.

But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary."" ""I don't know if there's been much hostility; I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated,"" Delrahim says. ""Over the last 30-40 years we've had a pretty strong and bipartisan consensus ... on the right balance for antitrust enforcement ... Are there areas, do we wish it would go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets. We're not picking winners and losers, we are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure the markets are free, for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones."" And as for the president's tweets about antitrust matters, including weighing in on the ACA's pressure on Comcast (CMCSA -0.2%), Delrahim notes the consent decree tied to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal expired but it's his job to make sure markets work nonetheless -- and he reiterated his opposition to behavioral remedies to cure antitrust concerns. ""We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make profit, and then they evaporate after five years, 10 years, seven years,"" he says. ""And it makes no sense because seven years before, we're trying to guess where the market is."" ""I believe in structural solutions,"" he adds, saying that's why DOJ was opposed to parts of the AT&T/Time Warner merger ""and that was the solution we provided.""

We don’t feel that we should. These concepts have guided our design process for years because privacy is a core value at Apple, not an obligation or an aftermarket add-on.”     ",2018-09-24
454,"Risky business: Apple seeks streaming success without violence, sex","
 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking a conservative approach with its push into streaming entertainment, seeking high-quality shows with big names and wide appeal but without gratuitous sex, profanity or violence, WSJ reports. Tim Cook reportedly spiked a show about hip hop artist Dr. Dre's life because it featured drug use, sex and violence, sending a clear message to Hollywood that AAPL does not want shows that could taint is brand image. The result is an approach out of step with other video streaming platforms including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which have made their mark in original content with edgier programming that often wins critical acclaim. As a consumer product company, AAPL is especially exposed if content strikes a sour note, former NBC and Fox programming exec Preston Beckman tells WSJ. The only risk for NFLX is that people don’t subscribe, but “with Apple, you can say, ‘I’m going to punish them by not buying their phone or computer.'""  ",2018-09-24

 Disney's (DIS +1.5%) streaming ambitions play a big part in the company's three goals to strive in a heavily shifting industry, CEO Bob Iger says: Make great content, innovate in how you deliver the content, and seek a truly global nature. In an interview tied to his topping The Hollywood Reporter 100 list as entertainment's most powerful figure, Iger says of industry upheaval: ""I believe we have to look at this as opportunity vs. threat."" He's ""impressed"" with premium content gains at Netflix (NFLX -0.5%) and Amazon.com (AMZN +0.9%), but ""none of them is either Disney or Marvel. Or Pixar. Or Star Wars or National Geographic or FX or Searchlight or Avatar — I could go on."" That quote calls out the Fox media assets that Disney is about to add, but Iger says he doesn't anticipate a Netflix-type increase in spending. Responding to the recent analysis noting a couple billion dollars in revenue at risk, he says ""We're weaning ourselves off licensing revenue from third parties ... So there's more spend in production and there's less licensing revenue."" They're playing the ""long game and not the short."" He's got ""nothing but praise"" for the job Jimmy Pitaro has done since taking over ESPN, adding that in terms of society/politics ""Jimmy felt that the pendulum may have swung a little bit too far away from the field. And I happen to believe he was right."" (Today, ESPN Plus noted it hit 1M paying subs since its April launch.) It ""only makes sense"" for Marvel's Kevin Feige to oversee the X-Men franchise when the Fox deal is done, he says. And he acknowledges that the failure of Solo: A Star Wars Story may have been ""a little too much, too fast"" in terms of pacing the franchise films.Previously: WSJ: Hulu may make more sense in Comcast hands (Sep. 17 2018)Previously: THR analysis: Disney streaming marks multibillion-dollar gamble (Sep. 13 2018)  ",2018-09-20

460,More details on Amazon cashierless store report,"
 Some grocery stocks are seeing volatile trading after hours as details emerge about the late-day report that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is looking at opening up to 3,000 cashierless stores by 2021 -- its latest major shot across the bow of an entrenched industry. Amazon finished down 0.8% and is near flat after hours. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is flat postmarket while Kroger (NYSE:KR) has swung back to a 1.2% after-hours gain following a finish down 1.4%. Target (NYSE:TGT) is down 0.2% in late trading after closing down 0.6%. Bloomberg's report paints a picture of something in between a fast-meal location like Pret A Manger or Subway, and a 7-Eleven style convenience store with more groceries in addition to prepared meals. CEO Jeff Bezos thinks the company's best chance to disrupt brick-and-mortar shopping may be mealtime logjams in busy cities, according to the report. Either route the company pursues will be expensive. The original AmazonGo cashierless store in downtown Seattle needed $1M in hardware alone to enable the sensors to allow people to scan in on entry and simply walk out with what they wanted. But sticking to prepared foods rather than groceries would require fewer cameras and sensors, and those goods have a wider profit margin than groceries do.The U.S. currently has 155,000 convenience stores, with 122,500 of them combined with gas stations; nonfuel purchases at those stores were $233B in 2016, led by tobacco products.

 On the net neutrality front, new research suggests that the country's biggest telecoms are slowing traffic to some of the most popular apps -- particularly video, including YouTube (GOOG -1.7%, GOOGL -1.6%) and Netflix (NFLX -1.2%). YouTube is the top target of throttling, according to the study from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. But data speeds are also slowing for Amazon Prime Video (AMZN +1.4%) and the NBC Sports app (CMCSA -1.3%), based on research using the smartphone app Wehe. The study calls out ""differentiation"" in traffic treatment in more than 11,100 occasions by Verizon (VZ -2.5%); 8,398 times by AT&T (T -0.7%); nearly 3,900 times at T-Mobile (TMUS -0.4%); and 339 times at Sprint (S +0.1%). Carriers meanwhile say they are throttling to manage network traffic and sacrifice speed in order to deliver videos. ""Unequivocally we are not selectively throttling by what property it is,"" AT&T's John Donovan says. ""We don’t look at any traffic differently than any other traffic."" Donovan compares the throttling to an electricity grid where some customers sign up for rolling blackouts in return for cheaper service.Previously: California Senate rallies votes for tough net neutrality bill (Aug. 31 2018)Previously: Net neutrality fight takes root in California (Aug. 31 2018)Previously: Lawmakers press for probe into Verizon's firefighter throttling (Aug. 24 2018)  ",2018-09-4

The companies would have to “pay taxes commensurate to how much the government is now spending for that assistance.” Sanders called out Amazon and Jeff Bezos by name. Amazon’s lengthy blog post response includes a “food stamp” rebuttal: “In the U.S., the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15/hour before overtime. We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers. Senator Sanders’ references to SNAP, which hasn’t been called “food stamps” for several years, are also misleading because they include people who only worked for Amazon for a short period of time and/or chose to work part-time — both of these groups would almost certainly qualify for SNAP.”     Previously: Morgan Stanley raises Amazon target, implies $1.2T value (Aug. 29) ",2018-08-29

We remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.""""With regard to this recent test of Amazon Rekognition by the ACLU, we think that the results could probably be improved by following best practices around setting the confidence thresholds (this is the percentage likelihood that Rekognition found a match) used in the test. While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldn’t be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty. When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.""""Finally, it is worth noting that in real world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgement (and not to make fully autonomous decisions), where it can help find lost children, restrict human trafficking, or prevent crimes.” ",2018-07-26

        Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the move after some tweets from President Trump. First tweet: “The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a BIG percentage of their packages….”                Trump slammed the Postal Service late last year for undercharging Amazon for deliveries, which he claimed cost the service money. The Postal Service’s FY17 results had revenue down $1.8B on the year due to declines in First-Class and Marketing Mail, partially offset by a growth in package volume.               Last month’s Supreme Court ruling pertaining to online sales taxes actually benefitted Amazon. The company already collected sales tax on the product it sells directly and the ruling didn’t specify how third-party sales should be taxed.  Second tweet: “….In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?”                The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos’ holding company Nash Holdings, not Amazon itself.                Amazon shares are down 1.5% to $1,787.32.     Previously: Trump slams Amazon while calling for higher Post Office pricing (Dec. 29, 2017)Previously: Online retail rattled by Supreme Court ruling (June 21) ",2018-07-23

 The California legislature is set to vote Thursday on the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, an online privacy law that could bring sweeping change to how tech giants gather and monetize consumer data. While the law would only apply to California citizens, the cost and difficulty of maintaining different sets of privacy protections for them and for the rest of the country means companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Microsoft and Uber (UBER) could change their policies toward the entire country.

 Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is building a health and wellness team inside its Alexa smart-assistant initiative, CNBC reports, in what may be a new device-centric effort to disrupt healthcare. An internal document points to a team of more than a dozen reporting to executive Rachel Jiang, according to the report -- including Missy Krasner, who joined last year after work at Box and Google, and 10-year veteran engineer Larry Ockene. The group is reportedly targeting areas like diabetes management, care for mothers and infants, and aging, CNBC says.

They have a nice two-sided market that they can subsidize one to advantage (the other).” Nadella said customers would prefer Azure because Microsoft doesn’t have any competing interests.                   Jassy, to CNBC: “The way that Amazon partners with customers is very unique. Technology companies today are mostly competitor-focused, or they’re product-focused…Those strategies can work, but they’re just not ours.

        U.S. Supreme Court justices appear undecided on whether states should force out-of-state e-commerce companies to collect sales taxes.               The case in question relates to South Dakota’s desire to overturn a 1992 Supreme Court precedent saying states can’t require retailers to collect state sales taxes if the business isn’t physically present in the state.                Reuters says several justices would prefer for Congress to pass a law that settles the issue on a national basis.                South Dakota is appealing a lower court ruling that favored Wayfair (W +5.7%), Overstock.com (OSTK +1.8%), and Newegg. The state passed its own law in 2016 that requires online retailers to collect taxes if total sales cross $100K or 200 separate transactions.                President Donald Trump recently went on several Twitter rants about Amazon’s (AMZN +2.7%) failure to collect state sales taxes and not paying fair rates to the postal service.  Previously: Trump economic adviser comments on Amazon and ""level playing field"" (April 4) ",2018-04-17

769,GBH: Amazon and Facebook could disrupt live sports broadcasting,"
        GBH Research analyst Daniel Ives sees Amazon (AMZN +0.6%) and Facebook (FB -0.2%) disrupting the live sports market.                  Ives calls the next 12 to 18 months a “pivotal window” for the tech giants to secure professional sports program rights.                   Ives: “We note in 2021, the year when the NFL, MLB and NHL media rights deals mostly end, will be the first major opportunity for Amazon, Facebook and other major tech streaming platforms to potentially bid on some of these rights versus the likes of traditional entrenched media/cable players.” Both companies have pushed hard into original content with Facebook willing to spend up to $1B this year and Ives estimating that Amazon could spend over $5B.          Ives will monitor the Facebook deal to stream 25 MLB games to gauge whether streaming platforms can disrupt this market.               The analyst calls Google (GOOG +0.4%) and Apple (AAPL +0.8%) “wild cards” in the live sports battle and says Snap (SNAP -0.8%) and Twitter (TWTR -1.1%) are “tangentially in the mix.”  Previously: Facebook in exclusive deal to stream 25 MLB games (March 9) ",2018-03-13

But as we have seen with other categories, that doesn’t mean Amazon won’t try again, and they should. Amazon’s focus on selection/service, pricing, and frictionless payment that drive conversion and stronger user economics also translate directly to travel.”                Nowak estimates that online travel companies spend about $620M for hotel room inventory acquisition, which couldn’t be much for Amazon to pay.

 Loup Ventures thinks that Amazon (AMZN +0.5%) could be sitting on the ""operating system of automated retail"" with the Amazon Go concept, along with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) at the ready. In one of the more riveting pieces on Amazon's future disruption on retail, analyst Andrew Murphy explains why the Seattle e-commerce giant is in the pole position in the $50B (market potential) automated retail industry. Murphy on AMZN: ""Just as Amazon did with FBA and, to a lesser extent, AWS, Amazon is initially building a backend infrastructure for its own use with Amazon Go. And just like FBA and AWS, that infrastructure gets more valuable as it scales. The Amazon Go backend gives the company a trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space, clearly an area of interest given the Whole Foods acquisition. Perhaps the more critical question is why a retailer would work with Amazon? Our answer is the same as it is with all of Amazon’s best offerings: convenience. Retailers would have a turnkey solution for automated retail. While larger stores like Walmart and Target may not want to use the technology for competitive reasons, branded retail stores (like a Nike store) may be a fit if Amazon can create a product that helps save the retailer labor and processing costs.""Related stocks: WMT, TGT, NKE, GPS, LB, SPLS, FL, FINL, ANF, EXPR, URBN, ULTA, FIVE.

According to multiple executives, WPP (WPPGY +1%), Omnicom (OMC +0.2%) and Publicis Group (PUBGY -0.5%) plan to increase ad spending with Amazon.com to $800M or more in 2018 -- what could be a 40-100% increase, depending on the firm. WPP spending on Amazon ad products and platforms will reach $200M this year, says CEO Martin Sorrell, and may jump 40-50% in the coming year. Publicis is already spending that much and looks to boost that figure to $300M in 2018. Omnicom, meanwhile, could double its current $100M spending. The appeal for ad agencies (much to Amazon's benefit) is the search for a viable challenger to what has become a digital advertising duopoly.

Disney closed up 4.7% today after weekend reports noted renewed heat around a Disney-Fox deal, but the Murdoch family is also in discussions with Comcast. Links to purchase prospects of Verizon, Sony and Amazon are more loosely sourced for now. A deal (for Fox's film and TV studio assets, as well as a stake in Sky (OTCPK:SKYAY), all worth some $50B) would mean Fox CEO James Murdoch could join Disney. Sky shares gained 2.3% in U.S. trading today. A suitor buying Fox's 39% stake in Sky would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest of it under UK takeover rules.  ",2017-12-4

Sky (SKYAY +2.1%) is seeing 8% Y/Y gains, to 819,000 viewers per match, according to Enders Analysis. BT Group (BT +0.9%) is up 9%, to 692,000 per match. The numbers are a healthy rebound from last year, which started poorly and ended up down 10%. That's good news for the league as it gets ready to press more competition for its rights with hopeful new entrants in Facebook (FB  +0.2%) and Amazon.com (AMZN +0.7%). Soccer is key for Sky, which has rights to most games in the league, and it and BT were under investor scrutiny for paying heavily for the rights (which so far seems to be paying off). Earlier this month, Facebook said it was interested in live rights but hadn't yet committed to bidding on Premier League matches.  ",2017-10-12

 ESPN (NYSE:DIS) is going to be all right, Holman Jenkins Jr. says, and never mind its recent Jemele Hill controversy or politics -- subscriber losses are bound to slow and it still has its valuable ace in the hole, live sports. With scores available on every smartphone, SportsCenter may not be as vital as it once was (and that may explain the network's current talent roster, he says), but live sports are a last bastion of ad viewing in a Netflix world. And while tech giants including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) begin throwing billions of dollars at content to build out their video, they may have a rude awakening translating their streaming-program experience into the technical challenge of serving up a live football game to 13M eager viewers, while the traditional broadcast model is optimized for it. ""The digital revolution certainly is upending the traditional 'linear' TV channels,"" Jenkins writes. ""But it never followed that the cable bundle would go away, only that it would become increasingly a live news-and-sports bundle. In fact, it already has (think about your own viewing habits).""

 Facebook's (FB +0.5%) skunk-works hardware initiative is working on a video chat device for the home, Bloomberg reports.

It would come from Facebook's Building 8 Lab, and be announced as soon as next spring's F8 developer conference, Bloomberg says. Adding to previous reports, Facebook would build its own voice assistant service to run the device and join Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant in the AI-helper space.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV comes in at the back of the pack with 21.3m.           Paul Verna, eMarketer’s principal video analyst, cites Roku’s neutrality as its primary tailwind. The company doesn’t have any ties to specific content or TV device platforms and can form content partnerships more easily.               A fight between Amazon and Apple kept the former’s app off the latter’s TV until this year, which might have hurt Apple’s share of the streaming market.                Google and Amazon also have the advantage of integrated their voice assistants into the streaming device, which could drive up the user base as smart home solutions become more popular.                The research firm isn’t optimistic about Apple TV’s chances, predicting the company will add less than 4M users by 2021 compared to the 20M to 30M net adds by the competition.   ",2017-07-26

1204,Whole Foods Market: Are we done yet?,"
 Shares of Whole Foods Market (WFM) are up 26.95% to $41.97 to trade almost level with the $42 offer price from Amazon (AMZN +3%). But are we done yet? Analysts from SunTrust and Oppenheimer are questioning if another bidder emerges as a defensive counterplay to the Amazon threat (per Bloomberg). While an offer from Kroger (KR -12.5%) for WFM could be considered a reach, there are plenty of European grocery store operators that are looking to box out the Seattle e-commerce giant. The idea of another bidder for Whole Foods is also rather interesting when the broad carnage across the retail sector being seen today is considered. P-E firms have significant ownership interests in many of the chain store stocks trading below market averages today, giving them a vested interest in keeping Amazon's brick-and-mortar ambitions at bay. #Amazon-WholeFoods  ",2017-06-16

Photos adds a persistent side bar, Photoshop-esque editing tools, better search filters, and the ability to synchronize the facial recognition Faces across devices.Update: The iMac line is getting an update that includes Intel’s Kaby Lake processors across all models. The smaller models are mainly getting graphics upgrades while the 27-inch 5K iMac will also get a power boost up to 5.5-teraflops so it can handle virtual reality development. New iMacs start shipping today.The iMac Pro offers more computing power with an 18-core Xeon processor, AMD Radeon Vega graphics card, 22-teraflops of power, up to 128GB of memory, 4TB of storage, and a nearly $5K price tag.

HEIF is the format for photos for a similar purpose. Portrait mode gets HDR and image stabilization. Machine learning helps the camera recognize different events and create custom slideshows or presentations accordingly.Maps now include major malls and airports and blocks notifications when driving to keep the driver’s attention on the road, not the map. On the music front, Airplay 2 friends add to a playlist and include other social features while also improving the speaker integration.The App Store is getting a new look. The Today tab acts as a “what’s new?” area that features one new app each day with a story about the developers. The actual apps will divide into the Games section and the Apps section, which is essentially the “not Games” section. The divisions will make it easier for players to find new apps, find games, or to avoid games altogether.The descriptions for each app will look more like a blog post than a sales page. And app game developers like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) will like the fact that the App Store now allows publishers to list and promote in-app purchases straight on the app page. Players might become more willing to making those purchases if the process is easy and doesn’t require launching the app then a search mission to find the desired purchase inside.Update: Apple is stepping up to augmented reality in a big way with the ARKit, which will bring advanced AR possibilities across iOS. ARKit supports Unreal Engine, Unity, and SceneKit and allows AR images to better integrate into the background rather than staying on top as a separate layer.

Both have the A10X six-core CPU and 12-core GPU and both a 12MP rear-facing camera and a 7MP front-facing camera.The 10.5-inch version starts at $649, which includes 64GB of memory, while the 12.9-inch starts at $799 for 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi.

And the iPad is getting its own iOS 11 updates including the ability to use Files to browse through both the local machine and the cloud to find stored files, an expandable dock, and drag and drop features.Update: And the day caps off with the anticipated Siri speaker with the formal name of HomePod and a $349 price tag. Amazon's Echo retails for about $180 and Google Home currently on sale for $109.But Apple's marketing the HomePod more as a music speaker than a general home assistant. The specs touted include seven tweeters and Apple's A8 chip. The speaker can automatically detect the environment and adjust the sound settings accordingly. Users must plug the speaker into AC so it isn't portable.The HomePod base unit is under 7 inches tall and comes in White or Space Gray and will become available in December.Follow The Verge's live blog of the event here.

 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to cast a shadow over the apparel industry. Not only does the e-commerce giant create pricing headaches for major clothing manufacturers, but the company's supply chain efficiencies and trove of consumer data are exceedingly hard to match.The next shot from Seattle could be even more disruptive. Amazon has a patent in its back pocket for a process covering the on-demand manufacturing of clothing and other products in a computerized method (screen capture of AMZN patent). ""By aggregating orders from various geographic locations and coordinating apparel assembly processes on a large scale, the embodiments provide new ways to increase efficiency in apparel manufacturing,"" reads the patent. The implication is that excess inventory would be no longer be a problem.Amazon, which already has it own brands of shoes, dresses and suits, is also planning to develop a line of activewear, according to a Recode report.While it's unclear in what direction Amazon's apparel push will go, on-demand apparel manufacturing could create a broad reset in the textile industry.

 Amazon.com's (AMZN +1.1%) Echo device family may be set for even more video functionality, with a likely announcement next month of a device with a built-in screen, CNET reports. That would follow up on the Echo Look, which would have a built-in camera and likely play a strong part in Amazon's apparel retailing business. The ""smart speakers"" in the Echo line have been Amazon's entree into digital assistants, and the new capabilities may be getting faster introductions due to the revelation last week that Google Home (GOOG +0.2%, GOOGL) speakers can now identify multiple users -- a ""wake-up call"" for Amazon, Ben Fox Rubin says.

Amazon's internal discussions centered on whether it would give a boost into the company's grocery push, a source said, but they never turned into a concrete plan. But with Whole Foods likely to look at strategic options, Amazon is still a potential buyer, as well as more traditional suitors like Ahold (OTCQX:AHODF, OTCQX:ADRNY), Kroger (KR -2.1%), and Albertsons, or even private equity that could buy time for Whole Foods to fix issues.Previously: Grocery store sector jolted by Jana interest in Whole Foods (Apr. 10 2017)  ",2017-04-11

1586,Cord-cutting: How fast are people ditching traditional TV?,"
 A new report is giving ammunition to ""cord-haver"" investors in an increasing high-profile TV industry debate. SNL Kagan sees a moderation in the cord-cutting trend, noting the ""rate of decline stayed about constant versus the past couple of quarters."" Meanwhile, at least some key companies are responding to the change: Even as pay TV bundle customers decline, they can see big new residential revenues from upticks in broadband Internet subscriptions. The firm forecasts broadband subscriptions will swell by more than 8M over 10 years, hitting 71M (ending up at 1.6 times the video sub numbers). Meanwhile, basic video subscriptions are expected to drop by annual compounded growth rate of 1.5% (to 45.4M by 2026), slower than last year's expected 1.7% decline, SNL Kagan says. It expects residential revenues to rise from $108.38B this year to $117.7B in 2016, and contributions from commercial services to push industry revenue from $130.57B today to $140.99B in 2026. On the other hand, Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research warns that more people are cord-cutting than you think, pointing to six straight quarters of Y/Y declines in pay TV subs. ""I’ve lost track of how many headlines I’ve seen over the last couple of years which posit that cord-cutting is somehow slowing down off the back of a small number of providers’ quarterly results,"" Dawson says, mainly due to observers focusing on quarterly net adds rather than annual changes, and looking at too small a sample size. Cable players have done well lately, but at the expense of telcos -- and even in cable, it's an example of the rich getting richer, with smaller players suffering. And Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is seeing worsening results despite its creation of streaming service Sling TV.

 Nation's Restaurant News points to a trend that may explain some of the weakness with restaurant traffic this year. Restaurants have been pushing prices higher over the last six months, despite lower retail food costs. On the other hand, grocery stores have lowered their prices in accordance with some easing of chicken, beef, and pork costs. It's a pricing spread that consumers may have caught on to if broad traffic trends are an indicator. Rising labor costs are the most obvious reason for the disparity. Restaurants expend about 30% of sales on labor costs, while groceries only spend about 14%.

 Amazon.com (AMZN -1.8%) could exceed $240B in gross merchandise volume in 2016, Goldman Sachs says, driven by third-party sales growth across the board. The company has increasingly been fulfilling third-party orders as sellers exploit Amazon's logistics investments. “1Q results are further evidence Amazon’s investment in infrastructure, logistics, and web services is accelerating market share gains, cash flow growth, and continued high returns on invested capital,” writes analyst Heath Terry. He rates the company as a Buy, with $800 price target (19% upside implied from today's price of $671.52). With third party units growing to 48% of the total (from 36% five years ago), “reported revenue growth has come to mask the true growth in Amazon’s share of retail spending.” Fulfillment By Amazon grew to cover 38.2% of third-party orders in Q1, up from a year-ago 32.1%.

Amazon (AMZN -2%) has stopped directly selling certain popular video games and movies - game examples include Grand Theft Auto V, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and Minecraft - to U.S. and/or U.K. customers not signed up for Prime. The items, some of which are offered to Prime subs at substantial discounts, can still be purchased by non-Prime customers via third-party Amazon sellers.
The move is the latest example of Amazon's aggressive efforts to grow its Prime subscriber base. The company hiked its free shipping minimum for non-Prime buyers to $49 from $35 in February, and rolled out a $10.99/month Prime option (to go with its $99/year option) a week ago. It has also been rapidly expanding the amount of ground covered by its same-day and 2-hour shipping services, which are free for Prime subs meeting minimum-order thresholds, and has been giving Prime subs early access to its Lightning Deals.
Past disclosures indicate Amazon has at least 46M Prime subs (the company refuses to share an official number) within a global active customer base that totaled 280M in 2015. In this year’s shareholder letter, Jeff Bezos called Prime (along with Amazon’s third-party seller marketplace and AWS) one of Amazon’s “three big offerings,”and declared the company wants Prime “to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.”

Most importantly, Berney tipped off that theater chains will have an exclusivity window before films are streamed.

Amazon snapped up six new films at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, a few of which appear to have strong box office appeal.
Also creating some buzz at CinemaCon was Sean Parker's The Screening Room which is looking to completely disrupt the industry with a service that makes films accessible at home the same day they are released in theaters.

Google/Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.2%) will open data centers in Oregon and Japan in the coming months to support its cloud infrastructure and app (IaaS/PaaS) platform, and plans to open another 10 over the next 12-18 months. The facilities will be a mixture of Google-built data centers and ones leased from third parties.
The openings will increase the number of cloud ""regions"" supported by Google by 5x to 15 - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) currently has 12, with plans to open another 5 - and are part of a major expansion push led by new cloud chief Diane Greene. Google's efforts also include upping its enterprise sales and marketing spend - both to gain IaaS/PaaS share, and to sell Microsoft Office clients on Google Apps.
CRN reported last week Amazon/Microsoft cloud client Apple has begun using the Google Cloud Platform. Re/code reported a couple days later Google has created a list of potential cloud software acquisition targets, with the goals of strengthening Google Apps and migrating the acquired products onto its cloud infrastructure.
Though Google's IaaS/PaaS services have won praise for their performance, pricing, and developer-friendly features, Amazon - in addition to having greater mindshare - is seen as having a more extensive feature set and (via the AWS Marketplace and AWS Partner Network) a much larger ecosystem. 451 Group analyst Carl Brooks thinks Google still needs to add more enterprise compatibility, compliance, and security features.

Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. ""It’s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud.""

16 months after unveiling its Echo Web-connected Bluetooth speaker and voice assistant, Amazon (AMZN -0.6%) has announced two cheaper, more portable devices containing a lot of the same features.
Whereas the $180 Echo needs to be connected to a power outlet, the Tap is battery-powered. Like Echo, both the $130 Tap and ($90) Dot support Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which was opened up last year to 3rd-party developers. However, while the Tap was built with music playback in mind - it has dual-firing Dolby speakers - the Dot has one tiny speaker and is promoted more as a personal assistant, smart alarm clock, and home automation device.
Notably, Amazon has struck a deal with Google/Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Nest unit to allow Nest's smart thermostats to be controlled via Alexa-powered devices. Re/code reports Nest considered making a product similar to the Echo, but decided not to, largely out of concern consumers would be nervous about Google-related privacy issues.

Analysts suggest the studio is worth about $5.5B today, notes The Hollywood Reporter, so a minority stake could still come to $2B. Viacom paid $9.8B for the studio a dozen years back. Major conglomerates like Alibaba (BABA +0.6%), Dalian Wanda and Fosun (OTCPK:FOSUF) have an appetite for Hollywood deals -- and Wanda already owns cinema chain AMC and producer Legendary Entertainment, while exploring a stake in Lions Gate. A key interest with those firms is ability to get Paramount products into China, where Transformers is a major phenomenon. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY +0.2%) has similar international media appetites. Fosun is trying to buy Bona and take it private, which would give it Bona's entry into Fox's slate.

In a marquee win for Google (GOOG -1.5%) in its battle against cloud infrastructure giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription music streaming leader Spotify (MUSIC) has announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform.
Spotify, which has historically relied on its own servers: ""The storage, compute and network services available from cloud providers are as high quality, high performance and low cost as what the traditional approach provides. This makes the move to the cloud a no-brainer for us. Google, in our experience, has an edge here, but it’s a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future.""
The company adds Google's unmatched data platform and tools were a big selling point. ""Good infrastructure isn’t just about keeping things up and running, it’s about making all of our teams more efficient and more effective, and Google’s data stack does that for us in spades."" Spotify VP Nicholas Harteau says his firm has already moved 250K of its 20M user accounts onto Google's cloud, and will migrate its entire service to Google within 18 months.
Spotify never mentions AWS in its announcement. However, the company is listed on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) site as a client. Per Amazon, Spotify has used AWS' S3 storage service to store music tracks, and its CloudFront CDN service to deliver apps and software updates.
The deal comes a few months after Google put VMware co-founder Diane Greene in charge of its cloud businesses, following the acquisition of a startup Greene founded (Bebop Technologies).

A 2013 report to Amazon's (AMZN -1.2%) leadership ""envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York and London,"" Bloomberg reports.
A source tells Bloomberg the project, codenamed Dragon Boat, is ""proceeding."" The initiative will provide competition for Alibaba and various cargo middlemen, as well as logistics partners UPS and FedEx.
Bloomberg: ""Amazon wants to bypass [the middlemen], amassing inventory from thousands of merchants around the world and then buying space on trucks, planes and ships at reduced rates. Merchants will be able to book cargo space online or via mobile devices.""
The 2013 doc: ""Sellers will no longer book with DHL, UPS or Fedex but will book directly with Amazon. The ease and transparency of this disintermediation will be revolutionary and sellers will flock to [Fulfillment by Amazon - FBA] given the competitive pricing."" Amazon would automate shipping paperwork and obtain cheaper wholesale cargo rates on account of its scale. Bloomberg adds the company could also provide financial services such as loans and payment-processing for merchants.
The report follows ones stating Amazon has received a license (via its Chinese unit) to provide ocean freight services, and is in talks to lease or buy 20 Boeing 767 jets. CFO Brian Olsavsky downplayed Amazon's logistics efforts during the Q4 earnings call, stating the company is looking to supplement rather than replace logistics partners. The ocean freight report observed some merchants could be nervous about handing over their supply chain data to Amazon.
As it is, FBA has seen massive growth - the service shipped over 1B units in 2015 on behalf of sellers, and the number of active sellers using FBA rose over 50%. Amazon has also begun hiring part-time delivery drivers for its Prime Now rapid delivery service, and is pushing ahead with its Prime Air drone delivery initiative.

With the help of a 2.4% Nasdaq gain, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wound up paring the initial losses seen after the company missed Q4 estimates and offered in-line Q1 guidance, and is now up slightly from Wednesday's close (after having surged on Thursday with the help of Facebook's earnings). Several firms cut their targets, Benchmark raised its target, and no one upgraded or downgraded.
Like many other Amazon bulls, RBC's Mark Mahaney (target cut by $60 to $715) thinks it's business as usual. ""Here’s why we don’t see a fundamental problem: 1.) Revenue was closest (2.7%) to AMZN Q4 Guide high-end in 5 years. 2.) Q1 Revenue Guide implies almost no change in Y/Y revenue growth, despite a 4 pt tougher comp. 3.) [Paid unit growth] of 26% Y/Y was highest organic growth in over 2 years. 4.) The cause of the heavier than expected Fulfillment & Shipping expenses was a Good Problem – excess demand – and not structural. The # of 3rd party sellers using [FBA - Fulfillment by Amazon] jumped 50% Y/Y""
Mizuho's Neil Doshi (target cut by $35 to $685): ""So what’s changed? Amazon is seeing greater third-party FBA-related units flow through, thus requiring more investment in fulfillment. Ultimately, FBA comes at higher margin than [first-party] sales, so we believe these investments will drive revenue and margin improvement over time.""
CLSA's James Lee ($710 target): ""The modest revenue miss was due to 'other revenues' and mix shift to 3P. Other revenues were mostly advertising, which was restructured in 3Q, causing a 50bp drag on the growth rate ... Excluding these impacts, e-commerce revenues beat consensus by 1% We think any concern in slowing growth appears to be premature as Amazon’s revenues grew 23% YoY, on par with Alibaba’s GMV growth in China.”
Needham's Kerry Rice is less bullish. ""While some of the short fall was attributable to FX, we believe the holiday e-commerce trends likely tailed off faster than expected and the revenue mix favored Amazon’s third-party (3P) business ... Q1 guidance was mixed with revenue upside likely driven by Prime and AWS, but lower than expected operating income as Amazon continues to invest in Prime, as well as ongoing investment in fulfillment, marketing and technology and content.""
Meanwhile, Amazon's disclosure that Prime subscribers grew 51% in 2015 (no subscriber number was given, as usual) is drawing attention. Re/code's Jason Del Rey thinks the figure implies Amazon has at least 46M Prime subs, given past disclosures.Also getting attention: A line in Amazon's 2015 10-K (filed in tandem with the Q4 report) in which the company refers to itself as a ""transportation service provider."" Several reports and disclosures have arrived over the last two months suggesting Amazon is expanding its logistics ambitions.

He sees op. margin growing 240 bps in 2016, fueled by AWS growth, lower Prime customer retargeting expenses, robotics investments, a mix shift towards third-party sales, and the leveraging of Amazon's Indian infrastructure.
He adds Piper's Amazon Search Index indicates the company saw 24%-26% Y/Y unit growth in Q4, and believes markets only expect 22%-24%.

1746,Retail watch: Holiday season winners and losers,"
 The success of the retail sector during the holiday season came into focus after a number of chains issued their holiday sales reports last week and research firms weighed in with data-driven analysis. 
Lesson #1 - Early and late: 25% of all shoppers purchased a Christmas present before Halloween, while the Black Friday to Cyber Monday period disappointed. A late flurry of shopping was a boon for many large retail chains, as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS (NYSE:UPS). Trading around anecdotal reports of Black Friday traffic now looks like an exercise in futility. 
Lesson #2 - Women over men: Sales of women's apparel were strong during the two-month period, up 10%, while demand for men's apparel tailed off significantly. A microcosm of the trend is the +8% comp reported by L Brands (NYSE:LB) - while The Men's Wearhouse (MW) is in a -72% 3-month funk. The disastrous performance in the electronics category (BBY, CONN, HGG) reinforces the trend. 
Lesson #3 - The sweet spot of retail was in the middle: Luxury sellers (COH, KORS, RL, TIF) had a weak holiday season as F/X challenges and lackluster Asian tourism factored in, while discounters also were scrambling due to a high level of promotional activity. The $2-gas benefit seemed to help in the middle where Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target (NYSE:TGT), Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), and The Children's Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) set up shop. 
Lesson #4 - No slowdown in online : Holiday online sales rose 20% Y/Y. Brands such as Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA) and Victoria's Secret that sell easily through e-commerce channels are well-positioned to benefit from the trend, although for a large part of the apparel sector the e-commerce mix is a margin cruncher.

The Seattle Times reports (citing cargo industry execs) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in talks to lease 20 Boeing 767 jets to provide air delivery services for its fulfillment infrastructure. Cargo Facts reports Amazon is ""negotiating for the acquisition of perhaps 20"" 767s.
Amazon, which has been running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington, Ohio, is reportedly looking to avoid delays at the hands of UPS, FedEx, and other logistics partners - two years ago, UPS' inability to keep up with Amazon's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after Dec. 25. One cargo industry source says Amazon ""expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a larger air cargo operation by the end of January.""
Leasing a new Boeing 767F is said to cost $600K-$650K/month, and leasing a converted freighter jet $300K-$325K/month. Even at $300K/month, 20 jets would cost $72M/year to lease, not counting fuel, labor, and other costs.

In the company's latest action to expand its massive fulfillment infrastructure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has bought thousands of truck trailers, with plans to create a fleet of thousands of Amazon-branded trucks to move goods between its fulfillment centers (U.S. map).
Trucking partners will still own and drive the tractor portion of the trailers, just as UPS and FedEx are still heavily relied upon for last-mile package delivery. However, the purchases add to a fulfillment expansion that has already resulted in Amazon delivering groceries to customers via its AmazonFresh service, and hiring part-time delivery drivers for its Prime Now rapid delivery service. Drone delivery is in the pipeline.
Analyst Ben Thompson recently argued Amazon could be on its way to becoming a logistics giant, particularly given the potential of drones to handle package delivery in non-urban settings. ""Wouldn't a company on its way to owning 50% of [U.S.] consumers as well as an ever-expanding 3rd-party marketplace program ... be able to make a play to own the infrastructure of all of e-commerce, not unlike their position in enterprise computing? Indeed, are we sure this is a retail company at all or has retail simply been a lever to build the most powerful - and ultimately, profitable - logistics company ever, both for enterprises and consumers?""

The correlation of total holiday season revenue to the length of lines at stores during Black Friday and the weekend sales tallies in years past has been nearly non-existent.

 The average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. has now dropped to $2.06 per gallon - a mark that is 27% lower than where gas prices stood heading into the holiday period last year. Despite the extra dollars in the wallets of consumers, most forecasts for holiday retail sales are on the modest side (below 4%). The extended period of sub-$3 gas prices in the U.S. hasn't exactly lit consumer spending across broad retail on fire (just ask Wal-Mart) - although it has stoked auto sales for the Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU). The regional casino sector (ISLE, PENN, BYD, ERI, MTN, MCRI) and cruise line stocks (NCLH, RCL) have also benefited more than major chain stores. Some have suggested that lower gas prices are also an understated driver for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which both score high on customer stickiness. What next?

The drones will lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics at the end"" that detect when a package has hit the ground.
The Google Express same-day delivery service (delivers goods on behalf of 3rd-party retailers) would be a natural fit for Wing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile is pushing ahead with its Prime Air drone delivery project. Questions still remain about the reliability and safety of large-scale drone delivery (particularly in densely-populated urban areas), as well as battery life and noise.
Separately, in response to last week's WSJ report stating Google plans to merge Android and Chrome OS into a unified OS for PCs and mobile devices, Google says it ""has no plan to phase out Chrome OS,"" but adds it's ""working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems."" Re/code had followed up on the WSJ's report by reporting Google will work with PC OEMs starting in 2016 to bring Android PCs to market, while allowing them to keep building Chrome OS PCs if they want.

1784,"Amazon abandoning daily deals, tries to challenge PayPal in mobile","

On Dec. 18, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will shut down its daily deals service, currently offered via the Amazon Local site and apps. E-commerce-related promos such as Amazon's Gold Box Deals won't be affected.
Amazon's daily deals service, originally launched in 2011, has struggled to compete against market leader Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and has also had to contend with a sluggish deals market in general. LivingSocial, which Amazon maintains a large stake in, announced a fresh round of layoffs two weeks ago. Groupon, meanwhile, announced in September it's cutting 1,100 jobs.
Groupon closed up 3.6% today ahead of Tuesday afternoon's Q3 report. The company's Local revenue fell 7% Y/Y in Q3 to $276.5M.
Separately, in a fresh attempt to wrest payments share from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon is rolling out a ""Pay with Amazon"" button for 3rd-party mobile apps. Amazon users can login via existing accounts, and pay via saved billing data;  the company had 294M active customer accounts as of Q3.
Many online merchants have been wary of using a payments service - and thus sharing transaction data - with their biggest rival. Amazon, however, insists it only sees transactions sums, and not the details of a purchase. The company reports Pay with Amazon's payment volume is up 180% Y/Y, but hasn't shared a dollar figure.
PayPal's mobile payment volume rose 42% Y/Y in Q3 to $16.5B (24% of total volume of $69.7B). In addition to Amazon, PayPal faces mobile competition from Stripe and Apple Pay's online payment services. Supporters of in-app Apple Pay purchases include Groupon, Best Buy, Starbucks, Panera, Airbnb, Staples, and Uber.

HP's (NYSE:HPQ) Helion public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) services will be shuttered on Jan. 31, 2016, HP Cloud SVP Bill Hilf discloses in a blog post. Going forward, HP ""will move to a strategic, multiple partner-based model for public cloud capabilities,"" as part of its effort to enable hybrid (integrated public/private) cloud deployments.
Hilf reiterates HP's commitment to its private and managed cloud offerings, which leverage software based on the open-source OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform (also backed by Rackspace, IBM, Red Hat, and others). Last year, HP bought Eucalyptus, a provider of open-source IaaS software that competes with OpenStack and integrates well with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
HP's decision comes with AWS on a $7B+/year run rate, and with IaaS rivals such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google also seeing strong growth. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently rolled out new services to make it easier for enterprises to migrate workloads to AWS. Meanwhile, VMware just suggested industry adoption of public cloud services is weighing on its results.

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) ripped the band-aid off this week to reset expectations for three years worth of earnings in one decisive action.
Though the Wal-Mart bombshell rocked a large number of retail stocks initially, many recovered during the week or pared their losses. Two notable exceptions were Target (NYSE:TGT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) which ended the week sharply lower due in some part to their similar track of heavy investments in e-commerce.
While investment firms analysts turned defensive this week on Wal-Mart (SA summary, BI summary), Target (TGT), and Best Buy (BBY) - some retail insiders see a different dynamic playing out. They note that, unlike Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the brick-and-mortar retail giants have decades in building out strategic infrastructure, supplier networks, and delivery systems. At a larger scale, and on a longer time frame, those advantages could lead to higher margins for the trio than Amazon as tech investments pay off.

Walravens notes AWS recently disclosed its database business is on a $1B/year run rate, and has seen 127% Y/Y usage growth. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 11 months removed from launching a ""commercial-grade"" database (known as Aurora) that targeted Oracle, and a week removed from unveiling a database migration service and storage transfer appliance for enterprises looking to move workloads to AWS.
He adds there's ""increasing customer dissatisfaction"" with Oracle's pricing and auditing policies (previous), and that some of Oracle's cloud deals stem from major sales incentives and ""may not go live.""
Separately, Oracle has been awarded $50M in a copyright infringement lawsuit against Rimini Street, a provider of 3rd-party maintenance/support services for companies using Oracle and SAP's software. Oracle had sought $245.9M; Rimini, which might appeal, argued it should only pay $10M.
The legality of Rimini Street's services wasn't on trial, and Rimini insists the suit covered ""processes no longer in use."" Oracle's ongoing battle with Rimini has been closely watched due to the potential of 3rd-party firms to eat into Oracle and SAP's cash-cow maintenance/support businesses.

Day two of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS re:Invent conference has brought the beta launch of AWS IoT, a service for processing and analyzing data from numerous Web-connected embedded devices (cars, home appliances, industrial equipment, medical devices, etc.).
AWS exec Jeff Barr: ""Although critics sometimes dismiss [IoT] as nothing more than 'put a chip in it,' I believe that the concept builds upon some long-term technology trends ... To me, the most relevant trends are the decreasing cost of mass-produced compute power, the widespread availability of IP connectivity, and the ease with which large amounts of information can be distilled into intelligence using any number of big data tools and techniques.""

Microsoft, IBM, and Salesforce are among the companies to have already announced cloud-based IoT analytics/data-processing services. AWS IoT follows Amazon's March purchase of IoT service provider 2lemetry.
Also launching today: AWS Mobile Hub, a solution promised to simplify ""the process of building, testing, and monitoring mobile applications that make use of one or more AWS services."" A console UI gives app developers the ability to pick ""higher-level features"" combining one or more services, SDKs, and pieces of code. Barr: ""What once took a day to properly choose and configure can now be done in 10 minutes or so."" A slew of AWS mobile app development services have launched over the last 3 years.
Meanwhile, Amazon has received good reviews for yesterday's AWS announcements. Many observers note the new offerings, such as the Snowball storage/data-transfer appliance and database-migration services (not to mention a new Accenture business unit focused on AWS migrations), aim to make it as easy as possible for enterprises to ditch traditional IT infrastructures in favor of AWS' public cloud.
The NYT's Quentin Hardy: ""Previously, old-guard enterprise companies dismissed A.W.S. and cloud computing, then grudgingly ceded them a place for start-ups and new applications. But with about three-quarters of information technology spending going to maintaining legacy systems, they could afford to. Wednesday, Amazon went after the rest of their business.""

ETSY has sold off following the launch of the Handmade at Amazon craft goods marketplace (anticipated for several months). Volume has been moderate - 430K shares vs. a 3-month daily average of 1.12M.
""Etsy has a decade of experience understanding the needs of artists and sellers and supporting them in ways that no other marketplace can,"" the company states in an official response to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launch. ""Our platform attracts 21+ million thoughtful consumers seeking to discover unique goods, and build relationships with the people who make and sell them.""
For now, Etsy's selection dwarfs Amazon's - the company had 29M items listed on its site at the end of 2014, whereas Amazon's marketplace (has set strict listing rules) currently has 80K+. Amazon is hoping to gain ground by promoting its marketplace to its 285M+ active customers, by offering craft goods makers access to its fulfillment services (including Prime, for those able to ship quickly), and by courting sellers who have struggled to get noticed on Etsy. “I want to get more than 150 page views,"" says one Etsy seller giving Amazon a try.

Only a 13.3% increase in Motors same-store sales (down from 20% in August) kept eBay's growth positive. Auctions were down 31%, and fixed-price sales 0.7%.

The WSJ recently reported an analytics solution was on tap. Much like BI/analytics tools from Tableau (NYSE:DATA), QLIK, Microsoft, and Salesforce (among others), Amazon is looking to appeal to non-technical corporate workers, many of whom still use Excel spreadsheets for data analysis and reporting.
As usual, Amazon is pricing aggressively: It claims QuickSight will cost 1/10 as much as rival products (rivals might beg to differ). Analysts defending the market's existing players have argued Amazon's solution will appeal more to SMBs than enterprises, given enterprises have preferred on-premise BI solutions.
Also launching: Snowball, a 50TB storage appliance for clients that need to transfer huge amounts of data to AWS. A built-in Kindle acts as an automatic shipping label.
Other product announcements: 1) A service for migrating databases to AWS, a schema conversion tool for making databases AWS-friendly, and support for the open-source MariaDB database. 2) Kinesis Firehose, a data-transfer solution for the Kinesis real-time data streaming service (launched in 2013). 3) Inspector, a tool for detecting potential security and compliance issues with AWS-run apps.

He cautions those he has spoken to haven't disclosed how far Amazon has progressed in creating such a service, and that the company may simply be exploring its economics.
Rayburn notes Amazon's recent purchase of video encoding/processing software and service provider Elemental Technologies (reportedly for ~$500M) would be helpful if it goes ahead with a live streaming launch. This year has seen Dish and Sony respectively launch their Sling TV and PlayStation Vue Web TV services; there have also been several reports Apple is prepping an offering.
Separately, in a report that helps back up Eric Schmidt's assertion that Amazon (rather than Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.) is Google's (GOOG -0.2%) biggest search rival, e-commerce software firm BloomReach states a survey of 2,000 U.S. shoppers found 44% go directly to Amazon's site/apps when looking looking to buy/research a product online. 34% start with Google or another search engine, and 21% go to another retailer's site.
Direct visits to Amazon affect Google's search ad revenue, which depends heavily on ad-buying from online retailers (including Amazon). Google has been trying to counter Amazon by integrating its successful Product Listing Ads with search results, and (through a feature called Purchases on Google) by allowing those who click on the ads to complete their orders on Google's site, using payment data already connected to their Google account.

The WSJ reports Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to use this week's AWS re:Invent conference (runs from Tuesday-Friday) to unveil a cloud-based business intelligence/analytics solution (codenamed Space Needle) aimed at non-technical workers, thereby challenging existing products (offered both on-premise and via the cloud) from Tableau (DATA -1.4%) and Qlik (QLIK +2.2%), as well as IT giants such as IBM, SAP, and Microsoft.
Details about the service are limited; the WSJ notes it will ""include a faster method for transferring or copying data to AWS,"" and that Amazon will ""supply a storage device that customers could send back filled with data"" in situations where uploading the data via the Internet would take too long.
""This will be the new 800-pound gorilla in the [business intelligence] market,"" predicts a Forrester analyst talking with the WSJ. He argues (as Tableau often has) the enterprise analytics market remains in its early stages, and estimates spreadsheets are still used for half of all business reporting. AWS claims over a million clients, Netflix, Dropbox, Nike, Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol-Myers.
William Blair's Bhavan Suri and FBR's Daniel Ives downplay the report, arguing most enterprises prefer on-premise BI solutions and that Amazon's reach (for now at least) will be limited to the low-end. Suri: ""[W]e believe it makes the most sense for BI solutions to be deployed where the majority of an organization’s data resides. Thus, although we believe the company will be able to leverage its brand recognition to drive healthy initial traction at the SMB level and within businesses that currently house most of their data on AWS, we do not view it as a significant near-term threat.""
Ives: ""We believe this market is only roughly 10% penetrated to date ... we view [Amazon's] ability to be successful in the big data market as very limited to the lower end of the market and not posing a major competitive threat to pure-play vendors in the near term ... The scalability and scope of current leading offerings from vendors such as Tableau have set a high bar in the market, with many enterprises already looking to pure-play analytics vendors for this enterprise-wide market, greenfield opportunity.""
Amazon has already launched a service for warehousing and analyzing structured data (Redshift), and a service for processing real-time data streams (Kinesis). Meanwhile, ahead of AWS re:Invent, Tableau has unveiled a connector that allows its platform to interact with AWS databases, as well as the availability of its core Tableau Server product on the AWS Marketplace.

GE, Samsung, and Oster are among 11 new supporters of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Dash Replenishment Service (DRS), which allows Web-connected appliances and electronics to automatically reorder supplies when they run low. Existing supporters include Whirlpool, Brita, and Brother.
Examples of DRS-enabled devices at work include printers automatically reordering ink, water pitchers automatically ordering filters, and washers ordering detergent. Amazon claims hardware makers can support the service by adding as few as 10 lines of code to a device's software.
DRS complements Amazon's Dash Buttons (mocked by some, praised by others), which let Prime subs reorder a name-brand product simply by pressing a button on a small device that can be hung or stuck someplace within a home.

Both solutions are arguably part of a broader effort by Amazon to keep consumers (Prime subs especially) habitually ordering from the company, by offering a level of convenience and value-added services smaller online retailers can't provide.
Separately, in an eyebrow-raising move, Amazon has told marketplace sellers it won't allow Apple TV set-tops and Google's Chromecast HDMI stick to be sold on its site as of Oct. 29, The Fire TV vendor claims the move is due to the fact Apple TV/Chromecast don't ""interact well"" with Prime Video.

 Amazon.com (AMZN +0.8%) and CBS (CBS -0.6%) have built on an existing partnership with a new exclusive multi-series licensing deal -- a coup amid hot competition with Netflix and Hulu for content rights. The move makes Amazon Prime the video home of upcoming comic thriller series BrainDead, where members will be able to stream episodes four days after a broadcast airing. The two used a similar quick-turnaround approach for Under the Dome three years ago, and Amazon also has rights to Extant, starring Halle Berry. The deal also means more CBS and Showtime library titles are available to Amazon Prime members, including I Love Lucy, The Tudors, The Amazing Race and films like Inside Llewyn Davis.

 The 365 by Whole Foods Market brand to be unveiled next year in Los Angeles will be designed to appeal to younger shoppers, according to Whole Foods (WFM) CIO Jason Buechel. The new brand also highlights a bigger shift at the company to focus on technology solutions, including supply chain and labor scheduling digital initiatives.
A stickier loyalty program powered by online interactions is also a primary goal at the grocery chain. Shares of Whole Foods haven't traded over $40 since July on concerns over the impact of more competition in the sector.

""Make $18–25/hr delivering packages for Amazon with your car and smartphone. Be your own boss: deliver when you want, as much as you want,"" reads the pitch for Amazon's (AMZN +0.2%) Flex part-time delivery driver network. Flex has launched in Seattle, and will be available ""soon"" in NYC, Chicago, Dallas, and several other cities.
For now, Flex is limited to Amazon's Prime Now rapid delivery service (orders delivered in 1 or 2 hours), but could expand to other packages in the future. Drivers need to be at least 21 years old, have an Android phone, and pass a background check. They can ""choose any available 2, 4, and 8 hour blocks of time to work the same day, or set availability for up to 12 hours per day for the future.""
Assuming it's able to hire enough drivers, Flex gives Amazon a low-cost way to expand its rapid/same-day delivery footprint, and represents a challenge to ride-sharing giant UBER, which has been hungry to expand into delivery/logistics services.

One catch: Due to licensing issues, the feature isn't available for all titles on Amazon's Instant Video streaming service. Amazon says ""thousands"" of titles are currently supported, and that users will generally have 15-30 days to watch them after downloading.

""I would see people practically combust,"" says a former project manager. Another ex-employee: “One time I didn’t sleep for four days straight.”
In a 6,000-word piece, the NYT depicts a culture in which employees work very long hours, stay plugged in during vacations, often get little sympathy for family/health issues, are ""held accountable for a staggering array of metrics,"" and are urged to aggressively critique co-workers on their ideas. High turnover is said to be a fact of life.
The column isn't entirely critical. It notes some interviewed employees ""said they thrived at Amazon precisely because it pushed them past what they thought were their limits,"" and that at its best, Amazon can be ""a place willing to embrace risk and strengthen ideas by stress test.""
It suggests the culture has its roots in Jeff Bezos' managerial philosophy, which (among other things) emphasizes obsessing over the customer experience, relying heavily on data, valuing honest criticism over workplace ""harmony,"" and urging employees to take ownership of product areas and ""dive deep"" to uncover problems. At a 2003 meeting, Bezos reportedly said he didn't want Amazon to become ""a country club"" like Microsoft.
In an employee memo, Bezos makes it clear he isn't pleased with the column. ""The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know ... But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR ... I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.""

 Whole Foods Market's (WFM +0.9%) Chief Information Officer, Jason Buechel, has been lifted into the company's executive leadership team. The move means he has the same voting power as other senior execs -- he previously reported to CFO Glenda Flanagan -- and it underscores the growing importance of IT at the grocery chain. Whole Foods is investing heavily in infrastructure to satisfy customer demand for information. The moves include a new unified point-of-sale system and a rewards program to enhance loyalty, which it hopes to have nationwide by late this year.

""Our goal is to overtake Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale,"" states Simon Hu, the president of Alibaba's (BABA -0.2%) Aliyun cloud infrastructure (IaaS) services unit.
The remarks, along with Alibaba's commitment to invest $1B to further its goal, follow the March launch of a Silicon Valley data center. Though a major player in the Chinese IaaS market, Alibaba has a limited overseas presence.
Surpassing Amazon could be a tall order: While Alibaba had FY15 (ended in March) cloud computing/Internet infrastructure revenue of $205M (+64% Y/Y), Amazon Web Services (AWS) had revenue of $5.98B (+56% Y/Y) over the 12 months ending June 30.

An eBay spokeswoman states her company concluded same-day works better for items such as groceries and diapers than for many of eBay's core Marketplace offerings (collectibles, used goods, etc.), and that the logistics of managing same-day deliveries for 3rd-party sellers proved difficult.
She adds eBay continues to ""explore a variety of delivery options such as buy-online-pickup-in-store,"" and that in-store pickup will still be provided at retailers such as Best Buy and Guitar Center. Now had been launched in NYC, Chicago, Dallas, and parts of the Bay Area.
Also getting axed: A Brooklyn pilot program offering same-day deliveries from ~80 local merchants, and eBay's Motors, Fashion, and Valet apps. The company attributes the latter move to a desire to focus on its core app, and eliminate user confusion about which app should be used.
eBay's same-day exit comes as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues rapidly expanding its same-day footprint. The company recently began providing free same-day services to Prime subs in 14 metro areas. Google, meanwhile, continues to invest in same-day services provided for retail partners.

Not surprisingly, analysts are rushing to hike their Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) targets as shares jump following a Q2 beat fueled in part by an 81% Y/Y increase in AWS revenue. Barclays and B. Riley have upgraded to bullish ratings; several firms were prescient enough to upgrade prior to earnings. Amazon has given back some of yesterday's AH gains; its market cap is at $251B.
In addition to AWS growth, Amazon's 390 bps Y/Y gross margin improvement is drawing attention. FBN's Shebly Seyrafi (Outperform) attributes the gains to AWS, 3rd-party seller unit growth (45% of paid units vs. 41% in Q1 and a year ago), and lower shipping costs (4.1% of revenue vs. 4.4% in Q1 and 4.8% a year ago). Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju (Outperform) also thinks favorable Japanese comps helped, while adding the Prime price hike and past warehouse investments are cutting shipping loss margins.
Mizuho's Neil Doshi (Buy): ""Revenue growth (ex-FX) accelerated to 27% YoY vs. 21% YoY in 1Q, which marked the strongest growth we’ve in about 3 years. Gross Margins reached a record high of ~35%, and CSOI margin was 4.6%; the strongest we’ve seen since 1Q11. While Amazon continues to invest in the biz, the flywheels are kicking in – Prime subscribers are transacting more on Amazon, while investments in FCs, 3P and AWS are helping to drive margins higher.”
SunTrust's Bob Peck (Neutral) cautions Amazon's spending history could mean recent margin/profit improvements will be short-lived. ""Amazon has a history of 'giving back' operational efficiencies to consumers via lower prices, as well as aggressively investing to drive long- term [free cash flow] growth. Key initiatives include 1) marketplace, particularly on adding fulfillment centers, increasing [fulfillment] for 3P sellers, and expanding in India; 2) Prime, especially on adding content and expanding Prime Now; 3) AWS, adding new features/functionality as well as geographic expansion (new region in India). As a result, we expect margins to trend lower from 4Q’15 onward.”
On the earnings call (transcript), new CFO Brian Olsavsky stated paid units rose 22% Y/Y, and active customer accounts by 7M Q/Q to 285M. When asked about AWS' growth pickup, he noted major price cuts carried out in Q2 2014 led to favorable comps.

Separately, Google has been receiving a large amount of positive ink for Now on Tap (recently unveiled at Google I/O, ships with Android M), which lets users pull up info and content related to whatever appears on their screens (including content in 3rd-party apps) by pressing and holding the home button.
Backchannel's Steven Levy observes Now on Tap, which leverages Google's huge machine learning investments to analyze content, is effectively bringing search to apps, thereby helping address the threat posed by app usage to Google's search ad cash-cow. ""Liberated from the search box, Google wants to be your constant companion, ready with a search result whenever you ask and even when you don’t.""
Now on Tap could also serve as a selling point for Android, given it requires a level of hardware and OS access that Apple has never provided for iOS devices. Apple unveiled its Proactive assistant/Google Now rival earlier this week at WWDC.

1875,EU launches antitrust probe of Amazon's e-book practices,"

The EU has begun a formal probe into clauses included in Amazon's (AMZN +1%) e-book contracts that regulators claim provide Amazon with more favorable or different terms than those given to rivals.
Amazon insists its deal terms are legal and in the interests of readers. The company has been entangled in a number of high-profile e-book pricing disputes with major publishers such as HarperCollins, Hachette, and Simon & Schuster.
In the U.S., e-books now account for over 30% of total book sales, and Amazon has been estimated to have ~65% of the market. Strategy Analytics estimated last year the global e-book market was worth $7B in 2013, and would grow to $16.7B by 2020.
While the EU probes Amazon's e-book terms, U.S. regulators have paid more attention to Apple's alleged efforts to fix e-book prices with publishers. Apple settled last year.

1878,"Amazon provides free shipping for lighter products, takes aim at eBay","

Under a new program called Fulfillment by Amazon Small and Light, the e-commerce giant will provide free shipping for many popular items weighing 8 ounces or less, including ones whose prices fall well short of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) standard $35 minimum requirement for free shipping to non-Prime customers.
Items covered by the program will arrive in 4-8 business days. Most of the items will be provided by 3rd-party merchants relying on Amazon's fulfillment services.
To a large extent, the move takes aim at EBAY, which does considerable business handling sales of small/low-cost goods that come with free shipping. As it is, Amazon (both via direct and 3rd-party sales) has been grabbing share from eBay's Marketplaces ops for a number of quarters.
Last week, Amazon announced it's providing free same-day delivery to Prime subs in 14 major U.S. metro areas.

The WSJ reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to ""broadly expand its fledgling lineup of private-label brands to include an array of grocery items such as milk, cereal, and baby food as well as household cleaners."" It adds Amazon has approached TreeHouse Foods (NYSE:THS) and other private-label foodmakers about partnerships, and has sought trademark protection for various products under its Elements brand.
If the report pans out, Amazon would be joining Wal-Mart, Target, and many other retailers in offering a broad lineup of private-label goods; the company already offers private-label batteries, backpacks, and diapers (among other items). In addition to being cheaper - IRI estimates a 28% discount on average relative to name-brand equivalents - private-label goods often carry higher margins.
Private-label Amazon groceries could be provided through the company's expanding AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, as well as through its Prime Pantry service, which allows Prime subs to order up to 45 pounds of groceries for a flat $5.99 shipping fee.

Amazon (AMZN -0.8%) Prime subs in 14 metro areas featuring 500 cities/towns will now get free same-day delivery on orders of $35 or more for 1M+ items. Amazon previously charged a $5.99 flat fee to Prime subs for same-day orders (limit of 150 pounds); non-Prime users are still charged $8.99 + $0.99/item.
Covered markets: NYC, L.A., the Bay Area, Philadelphia, Seattle/Tacoma, D.C., San Diego, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Dallas/Fort Worth, Boston, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Tampa. Orders need to be placed by noon to arrive by 9PM.
The move comes ahead of Wal-Mart's launch of a $50/year Prime rival (3-day delivery vs. Prime's 2-day, no media services for now). CIRP estimated last week Prime had 41M U.S. subs.
Along with expanding its same-day reach, Amazon has been rolling out its Prime Now 1-hour delivery service (typically involves a $7.99 fee) in a handful of metro areas. In Manhattan, Prime Now recently began supporting deliveries from local stores to go with Amazon's items.

1881,Amazon stops using EU tax shelter; AWS tops Gartner's IaaS rankings,"

Bowing to regulatory pressure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has begun booking European revenue in the countries in which sales were recorded, rather than funneling it through the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The change, which could have a big long-term effect on Amazon's EU income tax payments, went into effect on May 1, and has thus far covered U.K., German, Italian, and Spanish sales.
Amazon already collects VAT on European sales, but its use of Luxembourg is one reason why its European income tax payments have been modest - the company paid just £4.2M in U.K. taxes in 2013 on revenue of £4.3B. The other reason, of course, is that Amazon's international ops (thanks partly to Asian investments) have been in the red - Amazon reported a $297M International segment op. loss for 2014, compared with a $2.11B North American op. profit.
Amazon's move could be a sign of things to come: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Starbucks, and a slew of other U.S. multinationals have also come under fire for their use of tax havens to cut their EU tax bills.
Separately, Gartner has given Amazon Web Services its highest rankings in its annual cloud infrastructure (IaaS) Magic Quadrant report in both the ""Ability to Execute"" and ""Completeness of Vision"" categories. Among the 15 IaaS providers reviewed, AWS and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure are the sole occupiers of Gartner's ""Leaders"" quadrant.
Gartner: ""[AWS] is the overwhelming market share leader, with over 10 times more cloud IaaS compute capacity in use than the aggregate total of the other 14 providers in this Magic Quadrant. This has enabled it to attract a very large technology partner ecosystem ... it is extraordinarily innovative, exceptionally agile, and very responsive to the market. It has the richest array of IaaS features and PaaS-like capabilities ... Although it is beginning to face more competition from Microsoft and Google, it retains a multiyear competitive advantage.""
Gartner does caution AWS ""can be a complex vendor to manage,"" and that it's ""spreading its efforts very broadly."" Altogether, it expects global IaaS spend to grow 32.8% this year to nearly $16.5B, and post a 29.1% CAGR from 2014-2019.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is prepping Handmade, a marketplace for handcrafted goods that takes direct aim at market leader ETSY. The WSJ reports Etsy sellers have received invites offering a sneak peek at Handmade, and directing them to a questionnaire regarding which products they offer.
Amazon's huge customer base and fulfillment infrastructure could quickly make it a thorn in Etsy's side. At the same time, Etsy's cult following and large network effect of craft/vintage goods buyers and sellers arguably make it tough to dislodge. Also (as noted by the WSJ), Etsy's 3.5% cut and $0.20 listing fee might make it cheaper than Handmade - Amazon currently takes up to a 15% cut on marketplace sales.
Amazon is two months removed from launching a home services site that competes against Angie's List. The company has also recently launched a restaurant takeout/delivery service that competes against GrubHub.

Two weeks after Bernstein hiked its Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) target to $600, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak has hiked his target by $70 to $520.
Nowak thinks 2016 Street gross profit estimates are 5% too low given recent margin growth and ongoing wallet share gains; he estimates gross profit/customer will rise 7% next year. In addition, fulfillment costs/unit are falling for the first time since 2010, as Amazon slows its warehouse-building binge. Nowak sees Amazon once more stepping up its fulfillment spend in 2016, but nonetheless believes its 2016 CSOI will be 5% above consensus.
Also: 1) Nowak believes Amazon's international losses are smaller than believed. However, a $269M 2015 international loss is still expected due to a strong dollar and Indian investments. 2) Nowak joins a chorus of analysts praising Amazon's Q1 AWS figures, while ""conservatively"" forecasting AWS' op. margin will fall 100 bps next year to 16% (he thinks the Street is modeling a 190 bps drop).

A survey from research firm CIRP suggests Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) U.S. Prime subscriber base has risen by a modest 1M since the end of 2014 to 41M (an estimated 42% of Amazon's total U.S. customers). The firm notes growth was limited by users cancelling subscriptions following a 30-day free trial holiday season promo - in December, Amazon said it added over 10M new Prime users during the holiday season.
CIRP also estimates U.S. Prime subs are currently spending at an $1,100/year run rate, down from $1,500 during the holiday season - some doubts exist about those numbers. 34% of U.S. Amazon customers are believed to own a Kindle tablet or e-reader.
Amazon remains unwilling to disclose its Prime sub count, though it has stated Prime subs rose 53% globally and 50% in the U.S. in 2014. RBC estimated last September Prime had 30M-40M U.S. and 40M-50M total subs At the full $99/year rate (many users still get discounts), 41M subs would yield $4.06B in annual revenue.
CIRP's numbers come a week after Wal-Mart announced it plans to launch a $50/year Amazon Prime rival. Wal-Mart's service will promise delivery in 3 days compared with Prime's 2, and won't (initially at least) come with content services such as Prime Instant Video, Music, and Photos.

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has moderated the pace of its cloud infrastructure (IaaS) price cuts over the last 12 months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't taking its foot off the pedal: Price cuts ranging from 5%-30% have been announced for its core Compute Engine computing virtual machine services.
Google claims it now has a 40% pricing edge over unnamed rival IaaS providers for many workloads - a 26% edge in list prices, plus a 14% benefit from ""customer-friendly"" pricing features such as sustained use discounting, per-minute billing, and a lack of prepaid service lock-in.
Also: Google has launched Preemptible VMs, a solution for running short-duration jobs on idle capacity at a 70% discount to regular prices (provided the capacity is available). The company suggests the option is useful for ""computationally expensive"" analytics and graphics-rendering workloads.
Google, which has tried to differentiate its cloud offerings by a focus on developer-friendly services - Amazon is still generally seen as having a lead in total features - also announced major price cuts last November. Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue rose 74% Y/Y in Q1, and that it was the market's 4th-biggest player after Amazon (towers over the space with a 29% share), Microsoft, and IBM.

1888,Google rolling out Buy buttons; European carriers eye ad-blocking software,"

In the latest example of an Internet giant trying to move activity from partner sites/apps to its own - for another recent one, see Facebook's Instant Articles launch - Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will soon roll out Buy buttons for search product ads that take users to a Google product page to complete their purchases. The WSJ reported in December Google had approached retailers about the idea.
Macy's is reportedly among the retailers talking with Google about supporting the feature, which will follow the launch of Buy buttons from Facebook and Twitter. Google will store and process payment info; retailers will still handle shipping, customer support, etc. Google is addressing retailer concerns about losing access to customer data by passing on contact info users opt to provide.
Google won't charge advertisers extra for adding a Buy button. However, it stands to profit if a faster/more convenient buying experience leads to higher conversion rates, thus compelling merchants to up their Google ad spend.
This could particularly hold true on mobile, where small screen sizes can lead to a poor shopping experience on 3rd-party sites, and drive users to make purchases via retailer apps (thus cutting Google out). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is indirectly in the crosshairs: Google has argued Amazon is its top search rival, given the greater likelihood of Amazon shoppers to go directly to its site/apps and bypass Google search.
Separately, the FT reports a European carrier looking to gain leverage against Google plans to roll out ad-blocking software (provided by Israeli startup Shine) to users this year on an opt-in basis. Several peers are also reportedly thinking of blocking ads.
The effort could run afoul of European net neutrality laws and/or spark a backlash from local advertisers and publishers - French ISP Iliad/Free was forced to stop automatically blocking ads in 2013 following government pressure. It could also lead Google and other companies whose ads are blocked to retaliate by blocking their content from being delivered to a carrier's users.

At least 7 other firms have hiked their targets. Amazon's market cap is at $181.6B.
JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth (upgrade to Overweight, $535 target) now values AWS at $66.3B, or 16x estimated 2016 EBITDA. ""[W]e think the reported profitability level far exceeded virtually all expectations. CSOI margins of 17% in 1Q15 and 14% in 2014 have been driven by increasing scale and greater utilization, along with additive services beyond core EC2 and S3 [computing and storage] services. When factoring in heavy depreciation, AWS has EBITDA margins of around 50%.""
Janney's Shawn Milne (upgrade to Buy): ""AWS segment margins of 16.9% in Q1, 14.2% in FY14 — well ahead of general Street thoughts that AWS was in 'investment mode,' and losing 5-10% (or more)."" He does note Amazon's North American retail op. margin fell to 2.5% in 2014 from 2.8% in 2013 (thanks largely to the Fire Phone debacle), but adds it rebounded to 3.9% in Q1.
Raymond James' James Kessler (upgrade to Outperform) focuses on Amazon's total margin improvement. ""Non-GAAP operating margin of 3.1% was ~100 bp above our/consensus estimates driven by improved gross margins and modestly lower than expected operating expenses. Amazon also guided 2Q margins above consensus at the high end.""

His target has been hiked by $65 to $465, and his 2016 EPS estimate to $2.46 from $1.03.
Pitz asserts Amazon's huge fulfillment investments (often criticized over the years) enable ""increasing scale efficiencies and much better control of the customer experience & service levels"" relative to e-commerce rivals, and have allowed it to offer ""the broadest selection of fulfillment options at the lowest prices."" He also notes the spending has helped Amazon expand into local commerce (e.g. AmazonFresh and Prime Now).
Like others, he also sees AWS (an estimated ~6% of current revenue) acting as a growth driver, and believes it has a better margin profile than Amazon overall. Pitz's target is equal to 14x his 2016 EBITDA estimate; he forecasts a 30% EBITDA CAGR from 2015-2018.
The note comes ahead of Amazon's April 23 Q1 report. Shares blasted off in January following a Q4 EPS beat made possible by gross margin gains and slower spending growth. Fulfillment spend rose 17% Y/Y in Q4 vs. 30% in Q3.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and HarperCollins (NASDAQ:NWSA) have reached a new multi-year publishing deal - expected to go into effect this week - that covers both print and digital titles.
The agreement calls for HarperCollins to set the retail prices of its digital books, with incentives for HarperCollins to provide lower prices to consumers.
In November, Amazon ended its brutal battle with Hachette over print and e-books, following a six month stand-off that battered the French-owned publisher’s sales.

1903,"HP denies public cloud exit, but wants to avoid competing with giants","

Following an NYT column featuring remarks from exec Bill Hilf that that were taken to suggest HP (NYSE:HPQ) is exiting the public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, HP has told CRN it remains committed to the space. However, the IT giant adds (echoing Hilf's remarks) it's ""not competing head-to-head with the big public cloud players,"" such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
HP's comments follow the February departure of top cloud exec Marten Mickos (joined via the Eucalyptus acquisition), and the splitting of his responsibilities between Hilf and two other execs. The company entered the public cloud market in 2012, and (like many other enterprise IT firms) has been a backer of the OpenStack IaaS platform (pitched as an open-source alternative to Amazon/Google/Microsoft's proprietary offerings). HP asserts it has the largest OpenStack public cloud in existence.
HP's stance arguably highlights the challenges traditional enterprise IT names face in countering the cost and scale advantages possessed by IaaS market leaders, who have often eschewed the hardware of IT giants in favor of cheap white-label hardware produced by Asian contract manufacturers. HP has partnered with Taiwan's Foxconnn and Accton to offer white-box gear for cloud providers.
Synergy Research estimates the broader ""cloud infrastructure service"" market (covers IaaS and PaaS, as well as private and hybrid clouds) grew 48% in 2014 to $16B, as more on-premise workloads get migrated to cloud environments and various cloud service providers relying on IaaS/PaaS infrastructures see rapid growth. Amazon towered over the space with a near-30% share, close to 3x that of #2 Microsoft. IBM, Google, and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rounded out the top 5.

1904,Amazon launches new cloud storage and machine learning services,"

Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) has expanded its cloud storage service lineup by launching Elastic File System, a solution that lets multiple cloud computing (EC2) virtual machines use a common file system that automatically scales as more storage is needed, and can be managed with 3rd-party tools.
Amazon argues the solution allows entire file systems to be handled the way that individual storage objects have been through its popular S3 object storage service. It sees ""content repositories, development environments, web server farms, home directories, and Big Data applications"" (all of which can contain a lot of files) as potential use cases.
Also launching: Amazon Machine Learning, a service that lets developers create predictive models leveraging large amounts of data. The service aims to put machine learning tools (an area of interest for both Web giants and many startups) within the reach of developers lacking expertise in the field. It follows the launch of Kinesis, a service that provides real-time processing of huge data streams, and Redshift, a data warehousing service.
In addition, two previously-announced services - Lambda, which automatically runs code in response to events, and the EC2 Container Service, a management service for Docker containers (lighweight virtual machines, increasingly popular), are now generally available.
Amazon, widely seen as having a feature set lead over cloud infrastructure rivals, had 2014 ""Other"" revenue (AWS-dominated) of $5.6B (+42% Y/Y). AWS revenue will be broken out by itself starting with Amazon's Q1 report.

Amazon says it's offering HarperCollins the same deal that Hachette, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan recently agreed to. But HarperCollins has its own online sales operations, after a move last summer to sell most of its inventory on its site, as well as deals with Amazon e-publishing competitors.

Amazon exec Peter Faricy: ""We have 85 million Amazon customers who have shopped for products this past year that often require a service afterwards."" 700 services are initially supported; much like Angie's List, Amazon argues it helps connect consumers with trustworthy businesses. Only 3 out of every 100 professionals in each metro are said to be accepted, with Amazon making sure each business is licensed, insured, and passes a background check.
The e-commerce giant also claims it only takes 60 seconds for a customer to buy a service. Faricy: ""We have standardized and prepackaged all of our service offerings. So you know exactly what is going to be done and how much it’s going to cost you, up front, no surprises.""
41 states are currently supported; Amazon wants to provide strong coverage across the 30 biggest U.S. metro areas. The Verge notes a beta version of Amazon's site suggests the company is taking a 20% cut on standard services, 15% on custom services, and 10% on recurring services.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) won't be among them, though, as it's passing -- which gives competitors a chance to nab a TV crown jewel and make up some ground in a content-acquisition arms race. 
Seinfeld -- a show that has generated more than $2.7B in syndication sales alone -- has 180 episodes, each of which should draw well over $500K in what should be a long multi-year agreement.

Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) has ""generated $1 billion in total worldwide revenue from Azure since 2011,"" BI's Julie Bort reports after talking with sources. Bloomberg reported in 2013 Microsoft had produced $1B in Azure-related revenue; however, that figure also included software purchases tied to deployments of the cloud infrastructure/app development (IaaS/PaaS) platform.
Bort adds over 3K companies have added Azure to their existing enterprise contracts, and that many of them ""are not using Azure at all, or have dabbled with it and then ignored it."" Salespeople have reportedly been pressured to boost Azure sales, and have ""sold Azure by discounting other software and adding the money saved on that software back into the contract as credits to try Azure.""
Microsoft hasn't broken out Azure revenue by itself; it's only reported as part of a Commercial Cloud segment that also includes commercial Office 365 and cloud Dynamics app sales.
BI's figure suggests Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has a sizable revenue lead over Azure. Amazon's ""Other"" revenue, which is dominated by AWS, totaled $5.6B in 2014 (+42% Y/Y).

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has bought 2lemetry for an undisclosed sum, and says it will continue supporting the company's clients. 2lemetry's services appear to complement AWS' Kinesis service, which provides real-time processing for massive data streams, including for data produced by IoT devices and sensors.

The move follows the 2014 launch of a Kindle store on Tmall, and comes in spite of the fact Amazon has invested heavily in creating a Chinese online retail presence via Amazon.cn. The company hasn't broken out specific revenue or GMV figures.
China's iResearch Consulting estimates Tmall had a 57.3% share of China's B2C (i.e. large-merchant) e-commerce market in Q2 2014, and Amazon.cn just a 1.5% share. JD.com (JD -0.2%), which has been outgrowing Alibaba in recent quarters with the help of its internal fulfillment/logistics investments, had an estimated 21.2% share.

Down AH yesterday due to the light sales guidance provided with its mixed Q4 results, Rackspace (RAX +1.4%) is now back above $50. Helping its cause: Pac Crest has upgraded to Outperform, and at least four firms have hiked their targets.
Pac Crest cites enterprise and OpenStack momentum as reasons for upgrading: ""In the second half of 2014, Rackspace won more large enterprise contracts worth at least $100,000 per month than it had in the prior five quarters combined ... management indicated that OpenStack now makes up more than 50% of its public cloud revenue, which implies OpenStack revenue is at least 15.6% of its total revenue.""
Cowen (target hiked to $75) now considers it likely Rackspace ""will announce support for a mega cloud provider in 1H15,"" thereby boosting its long-term addressable market and lowering future capex needs (in exchange for sharing revenue). It adds sales guidance was in-line after adjusting for forex, and that EBITDA margin guidance was better than expected.
Meanwhile, new CEO Taylor Rhodes argues the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market's price war is calming down. ""Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) in November, for the first time, didn’t make a price cut move ... AWS is feeling like they are the reference brand leader, that they are strong versus Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), so they don’t need to do it as much. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is cutting price, but who knows how much share they are actually taking.""
He also reiterates Rackspace's assertion that its OpenStack/hybrid cloud offerings are differentiated in the battle for enterprise accounts.

The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed rules for commercial drone flights that would lift some restrictions but would still bar activities such as the delivery of packages and inspection of pipelines and crops.
The guidelines would require unmanned aircraft pilots to obtain special pilot certificates, fly only during the day and below 500 feet. Pilots must also remain in the line of sight of their radio-control drone, which could limit commercial inspections and ground Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ""Prime Air"" program.
The draft rules still must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final.

A Reuters/Ipsos survey of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime users found 96% stating they're happy with the 2-day shipping/streaming service. The figure comes about a year after Amazon hiked Prime's annual fee by $20 to $99.
At the same time, 10% of 1,700 polled respondents who chose Amazon's 2-day shipping said items ordered between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 didn't arrive on the expected day. For its part, Amazon says its internal data ""shows significantly better results.""
Amazon mentioned in its Q4 report Prime subscribers rose 53% in 2014 (50% in the U.S.) in spite of the price hike. With the company declining to provide a total subscriber figure, RBC estimated in September Amazon has 30M-40M Prime subs in the U.S., and 40M-50M globally.
Amazon has added to its roster of local/regional shipping partners as it tries to keep up with order growth. The company's Q4 EPS beat was partly the result of a major slowdown in fulfillment spending growth (+17% Y/Y in Q4 vs. +30% in Q3).

WorkMail, an Amazon (AMZN -0.1%) corporate e-mail/calendar solution launching in Q2, takes aim at a market dominated by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and in which Google (Gmail/Google Calendar) and IBM (Notes/Domino) are also prominent.
Amazon isn't primarily looking to replace Microsoft Outlook and other client-side e-mail apps, but rather server-side platforms such as Exchange. The e-commerce giant argues its solution will be easier to use/deploy than alternatives, and also offer better security on account of having all data encrypted with customer-managed keys.
This isn't the first time Amazon has layered a value-added business service on top of AWS: It has already launched Workspaces, a PC virtual desktop solution, and Zocalo, an enterprise cloud storage/document-sharing platform.
Pricing is aggressive, but not incredibly so: Amazon is charging $4/user/month for WorkMail on a standalone basis (50GB of storage), and $6/user/month if bundled with 200GB of Zocalo storage.

The WSJ previously reported of a $350M deal price, while adding the final tab could be $375M if certain conditions are met.

AWS' data centers contain hundreds of thousands of servers running Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 CPUs.

It’s pretty clear why many energy stocks are hurting amid falling crude oil prices, but Morgan Stanley has researched across industries to determine some less clear-cut winners and losers.
Airlines consume huge amounts of fuel, but the firm says American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) should benefit more than most from lower oil prices since they do not hedge the price of fuel to reduce price volatility.
Among autos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) draws concern because ""lower-for-longer oil certainly hurts the case for mass-market adoption of electric vehicles.”
Since lower gas prices should reduce shipping costs, Stanley sees the benefit trickling into Q1 per-unit shipping costs at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The firm likes Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) on the idea that Americans getting cheaper gas might be more ready to splurge on energy drinks, and gas stations and convenience stores account for 75% of MNST’s sales.

 The strong reads on consumer spending (ICSC, Redbook) bode well for Q4 earnings in the retail sector, note analysts. Electronics sellers (BBY, HGG) and the luxury sector (RL, TIF, COH, KORS, KATE, FOSL, VRA) are viewed as being in a good position to see a December boost. Companies which eased off on pulling a bulk of their sales forward with Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals are also seen as potential winners with sub-$2 gas resetting some holiday budgets. Though e-commerce is expected to dazzle again this holiday season. It's not all fun and games for analysts looking at margins. The extension by Amazon (AMZN -0.1%) of its free shipping offer could be a signal that inventory levels are higher than anticipated and that the growth-at-all-costs mentality at the company is as entrenched as ever, notes Nasdaq Advisory Services.

 The S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is up 3.4% over the last month to outpace the S&P 500 Index as consumer spending trends improve. Analysts have honed in on some categories which show some promise for growth. 
Drugstores: The transition by the sector into more health/wellness services sets it up for new growth channels. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reported strong comparable-store sales despite the full tobacco exit, while Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) is prepping for a roll-out of RediClinics and HealthSpot kiosks. The visibility on Walgreen (WAG) is somewhat clouded by the giant Alliance Boots integration, although it's ahead of rivals on the tech front with its rewards program, pharmacy app and developing online doctor concept. 
Athleisure: There's some gender initiatives going on in the athletic apparel sector with Under Armour (NYSE:UA) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) growing their women's business and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) expanding on the men's side. All three companies have been closely on-trend with their assortment in a category with explosive demand. Importantly, pricing has held up this holiday season in the U.S., note retail watchers. 
Online replenishing: Fresh research into shopping trends indicates certain categories see continued buying through the online channel as consumers become attuned to a brand. Retailers positioned well to see more gains from the trend include Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), Office Depot (NYSE:ODP), Sephora (OTCPK:LVMHF), Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), and of course Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

P-E buyouts: There are plenty of candidates in the retail sector for a leveraged buyout similar to the action that helped propel shares of PetSmart (NASDAQ:PETM) +40% from their lows. Keep an eye on Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO), and Ann (NYSE:ANN).

The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has ""approached retailers about creating a 'buy' button"" for Google Shopping that would work much like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) one-click ordering feature.
Google is also said to be ""considering a [Google Shopping] marketing program that would allow merchants to promote two-day shipping."" The program would be similar to one from ShopRunner that provides unlimited two-day shipping from various retailers for $79/year. Amazon Prime, of course, provides unlimited two-day shipping (among other things) for $99/year.
Sources caution several retailers approached by Google were cool to the ""Buy"" button concept, fearing more price competition and a loss of control over the shopper experience. Google could profit from the button either by charging a transaction fee, or by simply seeing higher conversions when it's used (thus raising ad prices). The company might also get better conversion data than it's currently receiving.
As ChannelAdvisor's data drives home, Google Shopping ads (deeply integrated with Google search) have been seeing rapid growth; Wal-Mart, Best Buy, eBay, and Sears are among their many buyers. Amazon, though spending plenty on standard Google search ads, is a high-profile holdout.
Google officially launched its $95/year Shopping Express same-day/next-day delivery service (competes against Prime's same-day services) in October. Around the same time, Eric Schmidt called Amazon Google's biggest search rival, due to the fact Amazon shoppers are more likely to bypass Google search.

Major retail chains such as Whole Foods Markets (WFM), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are participating in Instacart's expansion - perhaps playing a little defense against Amazon Fresh (NASDAQ:AMZN) which also has growth plans.

The service, known as Amazon Travel, will likely go live around New Year's, and initially ""feature a curated selection of hotels"" near NYC, L.A., and Seattle. Amazon would collect a standard 15% commission from hoteliers who would upload inventory and set prices. A source says hoteliers would normally list properties at rack rates, but would also be free to discount. Though limited in scope, Amazon's service would put the company into competition with online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Orbitz (NYSE:OWW). OTAs have already seen Google, the recipient of much of their ad spend, encroach on their turf a bit with new services.

 At its annual AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched Aurora, a database solution for AWS clients that the company claims delivers ""commercial-grade"" performance and reliability (99.99% uptime is claimed) at ""1/10 the cost of the leading commercial database solutions."" Among those solutions, none looms larger than Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) core database offerings, which (in spite of tough competition from Microsoft and others) maintains an outsized enterprise share.
As it is, Oracle's database sales have been pressured by a secular migration towards cloud apps, many of which rely on MySQL and other non-Oracle databases. For a price, AWS supports Oracle's flagship 12c database, as well as several rival products.
Amazon has also launched: 1) Key Management Service, a solution that lets enterprises manage encryption keys for both on-premise and cloud apps/services. 2) CodeDeploy, a solution for quickly having new code go live on multiple AWS computing instances. 3) CodeCommit, a cloud-based tool for managing code revisions. 4) CodePipeline, a service that automates software releases.
What hasn't been announced yet is a new round of price cuts to counter the ones Google unveiled last week. After Amazon quickly matched a round of Google cuts in March, AWS' main reporting segment saw an unexpected Q/Q revenue drop in Q2; sales rebounded in Q3.
AWS chief Andy Jassy says his unit now has 1M+ business and government clients, and reiterates its long-term vision. ""The vast majority of companies will not own their own data centers in the fullness of time ... All that computing is moving to the cloud. This space is going to be a high-volume, relatively low-margin business.""

2014,"Einhorn talks up EMC, calls Amazon a bubble stock","

Greenlight Capital made a new ""medium-sized"" investment in EMC (EMC +0.5%) in Q3, David Einhorn discloses in his quarterly letter. Greenlight took a 2.9M-share position in EMC back in Q4 2013.
Much like Elliott Management (pushing for a VMware spinoff) and Barron's, Einhorn thinks EMC is undervalued on a sum-of-the-parts basis. He notes EMC's core storage ops are implicitly valued at less than 5x EBIT, and that management ""acknowledges that the combined business trades at a discount and has recently committed to trying to address it in early 2015.""
He's much less kind to Amazon (AMZN -1.2%), asserting the company's latest numbers are especially disappointing since they suggest the growth used to justify a dearth of profits is slowing, and in doing so is yielding higher losses.
Einhorn: ""One of the principal bullish assumptions supporting many bubble stocks is, 'the company is growing too fast to be very profitable.' We think AMZN is just one of the many stocks for which this narrative will ultimately prove false.""
Einhorn doesn't explicitly state he's short Amazon, though he does say Greenlight increased its exposure to ""bubble basket"" shorts in Q3.

2015,"Google continues cloud war against Amazon with price cuts, new features","

Google's (GOOG -0.3%) has once more aggressively slashed cloud infrastructure (IaaS) prices in an attempt to gain ground against 800-lb. gorilla Amazon (AMZN -1.1%). Price cuts covers SSD, database, disk snapshot, storage, and networking services, and range from 23%-79%.
Google, which likely has the most infrastructure scale of any IaaS provider (if one counts its broader Web services ops), has said it wants cloud pricing to fall at a pace equal to Moore's Law; that implies a halving every 18 months. It cut prices in March for both its core computing service (Compute Engine) and other offerings, and more recently gave Compute Engine another 10% cut.
The Web giant has also launched several new IaaS services today, with a focus on countering Amazon (widely seen as having a feature set lead) by catering to developer needs. The service getting the most attention is Container Engine, which allows users to manage and provision server clusters running Docker containers. Containers act as lightweight alternatives to virtual machines, and are quickly growing in popularity.
Also launching: 1) Three new network connectivity options meant to improve access to Google's fiber network' Amazon and Microsoft have made similar moves. 2) New features for the recently-launched Managed VM service, which combines the software flexibility of IaaS services with the ease-of-use of the App Engine cloud app (PaaS) platform. 3) Automatic resource scaling for Compute Engine virtual machines. 4) The integration of newly-acquired Firebase's mobile/Web app developer tools.
Amazon quickly responded to Google's March price cuts, and might do the same this time. Synergy Research recently estimated Amazon still had a 27% combined IaaS/PaaS share in Q3, more than twice that of any rival. Google was ranked #4, behind Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.
Meanwhile, Amazon has decided to give Prime subs unlimited cloud storage for photo backups. Before, the feature was only available to Fire Phone users.

2016,"Amazon still dominant in cloud services; Microsoft, IBM gaining ground","

11 days after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) disclosed its main AWS reporting segment saw revenue rise 15% Q/Q and 40% Y/Y in Q3, Synergy Research estimates the company's combined cloud infrastructure (IaaS) and app platform (PaaS) revenue share totaled 27% in Q3, still more than 2x that of any rival.
Nonetheless, competitors are gaining ground. Synergy thinks Microsoft (MSFT +0.9%), which saw 128% Y/Y Commercial Cloud growth in Q3 (covers both Azure and other services), saw its share rise above 10%. IBM (IBM -0.1%), which reported an 80% Y/Y Q3 increase in ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue, is assigned a 7% share. Google, Salesforce, and Rackspace are close behind.
In a PR, IBM states Synergy declared it to be ""the #1 hybrid and private cloud provider for the enterprise."" Big Blue has committed $1.2B to building up to 15 new data centers from which to deliver IaaS/PaaS services.
Hybrid clouds are also pivotal to Microsoft's efforts to gain ground against Amazon. Last month, the company unveiled a new hardware platform (to be sold by Dell) that can handle Azure private cloud services, and link with Microsoft's public cloud services to create a hybrid cloud.
Synergy thinks industry IaaS/PaaS revenue rose 49% Y/Y on a rolling annualized basis, and that trailing 12-month revenue has topped $14.5B. IDC expects public IT cloud services revenue (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) to post a 22.8% CAGR from 2014-2018, growing from $56.6B to over $127B.

What to watch: Most retail analysts and economists have a forecast of 4.0%-4.3% growth for holiday sales which factors in promotional activity at last year's level. Any extra discounting/promotions push from the sector could take sales below estimates.

The Fire TV Stick is much cheaper than the $99 Fire TV set-top, launched earlier this year. For two days, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is selling it for $19 to Prime subs.
Much like Roku's $50 Streaming Stick, the Fire TV stick provides Wi-Fi-based access to numerous Web video sources, and comes with a remote. Like the Fire TV set-top, it supports voice search and Whispersync. Roku, reportedly planning an IPO, maintains an edge in video content support for now.
The HDMI stick also supports casual gaming - no word on whether it supports the set-top's optional gaming controller - and 8GB of storage. It costs $4 more than Google's Chromecast, which is focused on streaming  content from a user's PCs and mobile devices.
Per custom, Amazon hasn't broken out Fire TV set-top sales. The device has faced tough competition from Roku's cheaper hardware, and Apple's comparably-priced hardware.

2021,Stone: Declining stock grant values could curb Amazon's spending,"

""Investor pessimism doesn’t seem to dampen [Jeff] Bezos’s appetite for risk. Employees unsettled by Amazon’s (AMZN -8.2%) steadily depreciating stock price are probably the only thing that can force Bezos to slow down,"" writes BloombergBusinessweek's Brad Stone in the wake of Amazon's Q3 miss and soft guidance.
Stone, who wrote a popular book on Bezos and Amazon, notes declining employee stock grant values caused by investor angst over Amazon's losses could increase employee turnover, something management is unlikely to ignore. Thus, curbing spending (with the goal of boosting Amazon's shares) could go hand-in-hand with keeping needed employees happy.
How much could lower spending boost profits? In a much-discussed September post, Benedict Evans estimated Amazon's trailing free cash flow would be around $4B (rather than a current $1.08B) if its capex/sales ratio remained at 2009 levels.
Nonetheless, Evans defended Bezos' strategy: ""Amazon has perhaps 1% of the US retail market by value ... Jeff Bezos’s view is pretty clear: keep investing, because to take profit out of the business would be to waste the opportunity ... The question to ask isn’t whether Amazon is some profitless ponzi scheme, but whether you believe Bezos can capture the future.""
The sell-side was in a less forgiving mood today: Two downgrades arrived (from Cowen and Janney), as did a slew of target cuts. Notably, analysts often expressed more concerns about Amazon's top-line growth slowdown (particularly for media and international sales) than its bottom-line pressures.

Bernstein's Carlos Kirjner asked about weak international margins - international op. loss rose to $224M from $28M a year ago - and why international's growth (14%) has fallen far behind North America's (25%). CFO Tom Szkutak (again) chalked up Amazon's losses to growth investments, and gave little detail about growth other than to state it ""has been softer across a number of geographies.""
BGC's Colin Gillis asked why North American media growth (+5%) was the lowest in years. Szkutak mentioned Amazon is seeing a demand shift from textbook purchases to rentals (could be a positive for CHGG), and that heavy discounting last year made for tough comps.
Total media revenue rose 4% to $5.2B vs. 10% in Q2, and total electronics/general merchandise revenue 26% to $14B vs. 27% in Q2. North American ""Other"" revenue (mostly AWS) rose 40% to $1.34B, and returned to positive Q/Q growth (15%) following huge price cuts earlier in 2014.
Other details: 1) $170M in charges were taken, largely related to the slumping Fire Phone. 2) Paid unit growth was 21% vs. 23% in Q2, and 3rd-party sellers made up 42% of units vs. 41%. 3) Gross margin rose 120 bps Y/Y to 28.9%. 4) Fulfillment, tech/content and marketing spend respectively rose to 12.4%, 10.8%, and 4.7% of revenue from 11.5%, 9.2%, and 3.9% a year ago.

The Manhattan store, due to open in time for the holiday season, would ""function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders."" It might also be used as a showroom for Amazon's Kindle hardware.
Though having experimented with Kindle pop-up shops and rolled out delivery lockers, Amazon has thus far shied away from investing in a more conventional retail presence, along with the requisite overhead.

Google, whose effort has been ongoing for 2 years, has opted for an unconventional aircraft design called a tail-sitter. It's described as ""a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around."" By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air delivery drones rely on 8 helicopter-like propellers.
Google's drones lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics"" at the end. The electronics detect when a package hits the ground, and then detach and are pulled back up.

The Atlantic doesn't shy away from the fact plenty of reliability and safety questions remain, as do nuts-and-bolts hardware issues such as improving battery life and reducing noise. Google is said to be ""in the very early days of developing a mature, reliable detect-and-avoid system.""
Wing is headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy. Over the last 12 months, Google has bought leading military robot maker Boston Dynamics, solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace (meant to further Google's Web connectivity and imagery efforts), A.I. tech developer DeepMind, and hardware engineering/design firm Gecko Design.

Twitch, whose platform allows users to live-stream their gaming activity (along with running commentary), has 50M+ users and a network of 4K+ content provider partners. The startup claims its average user watches 95 minutes/day of content.
Buying Twitch would represent a major investment by Amazon in free (ad-supported) online video. Thus far, the bulk of the company's Web video investments have been directed towards Prime Instant Video. Amazon has also been fleshing out its own game studio.

Amazon's (AMZN -1.8%) 3D Printed Products store currently offers 200+ products that can be printed on demand. As one would expect, many of the items can be customized to user tastes.
For now, the store's listings leave something to be desired: They include custom 3D-printed cufflinks ($60), miniature swords ($9), vase toppers ($40), and ""molecular earrings"" ($30). Amazon is also cross-selling its existing 3D printer and CAD software offerings.
Amazon's store competes private Shapeways' popular 3D printing marketplace, and a slew of other sites that allow 3D-printed designs to be manufactured and/or shared.
3D Systems (DDD -0.7%) sells products manufactured using its consumer-focused Cube 3D printers, and Stratasys' (SSYS -1.2%) MakerBot unit both sells items made using its printers and runs a popular 3D file-sharing site (Thingiverse).

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) hasn't been short of excuses for its dismal performance of late: in Q1 it was the weather, before that it was a reduction in customers' food stamp benefits, and before that it was the challenging global economy - when it reports Q2 earnings in three weeks, the excuse will be the guy who's no longer around, as former U.S. head Bill Simon was given the boot this week.
Analysts say WMT is getting hammered by cheaper and more convenient options such as online (think AMZN) and dollar stores (FDO, DG); some say the most crucial action for new man Greg Foran is to pivot away from the supercenter focus and continue growing the small-store footprint, but that could risk customers' need to visit larger stores and make additional, higher-price impulse purchases.
Foran's most pressing need may be just getting stuff on the shelves: WMT has cut its U.S. staff by ~20K since 2008 while  adding 650-plus stores, resulting in merchandise piling up in aisles and in the back of stores  because there aren't enough workers to restock the shelves.
As if Foran doesn't have enough on his plate, he will take over the reins of Wal-Mart U.S. on Aug. 9, during the back-to-school rush and not far ahead of the  winter holidays.

""We have a long-term view ... We’re not trying to optimize for short term profits,"" states Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CFO Tom Szkutak on the Q2 CC, repeating a mantra his company has uttered in some form for years. Judging by the reaction to the company's EPS miss and guidance for a sizable Q3 op. loss, investor patience seems to be wearing thin.
Szkutak admitted Amazon Web Services' near-term growth has been hurt by an ongoing cloud infrastructure price war with Microsoft and Google - while North American ""Other"" revenue was up 38% Y/Y, it fell 3% Q/Q, and Y/Y growth decelerated from Q1's 60%.
He also suggests Amazon's Q3 bottom line will be pressured by a ""significant"" increase in video content spend. The company plans to spend $100M on original programming alone, as it tries to counter Netflix's big content investments and keep Prime renewal rates high.
On the bright side, Szkutak says Prime subscriptions are still growing well following this year's $20 price hike, and that Q2 subscriber adds topped year-ago levels (no specific numbers, as usual). CIRP survey data appears to back him up.
Regarding China, he states Amazon has ""a lot of interesting things"" planned, and will continue investing in the Middle Kingdom. Alibaba remains the Chinese e-commerce market's 800-lb. gorilla.

North America revenue rose 26% Y/Y in Q2 to $12B, and international revenue 18% to $7.3B. The growth rates are even with Q1 levels. North America had a $438M segment op. profit, and international a $34M segment op. loss.

GigaOm notes many titles from Amazon's own publishing imprints are offered, and that none of the big-5 publishers appear to be participating. However, two of them - Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins - have made e-books available for similar services from Scribd and Oyster. Scribd charges $9/month, and Oyster $10/month.
The test comes as e-book sales growth slows dramatically following years of heady growth, as many readers decide they'd rather stick with print. Trade group AAP estimates U.S. e-book sales were roughly flat in 2013 at $3B, and made up a little over 1/5 of total trade publishing revenue of $14.6B.

Zocalo, a new Amazon Web Services (AMZN -0.7%) offering aimed at enterprises, provides 200GB of cloud storage to go with document-sharing, IT admin controls, and integration with AWS' WorkSpaces PC virtualization offering.
Amazon is charging just $5/user/month, easily undercutting BOX, Dropbox, and a slew of other rivals. Microsoft and Google are also pricing aggressively.
Amazon is also rolling out several new services for mobile developers relying on AWS. They include mobile analytics tools able to deliver usage reports on billions user events, a cross-platform push notification service, and a service (Cognito) for managing user identities/data across platforms. An SDK for connecting apps to AWS is also being launched.
Last November, Amazon rolled out AppStream, a service that allows games/apps to be streamed to mobile devices. The latest service launches come as Google tries hard to sell developers on the simplicity/ease-of-use of its cloud platform relative to Amazon's, which maintains a feature set edge.
Amazon's North American ""Other"" revenue (mostly AWS) rose 60% Y/Y in Q1 to $1.2B. Synergy Research's numbers suggest Amazon's combined IaaS/PaaS share still dwarfs that of rivals.
Separately, the FTC has officially announced it's suing Amazon for billing parents for in-app purchases accidentally made by their kids; the agency settled a similar suit with Apple earlier in 2014. Any payout should amount to a slap on the wrist for a company of Amazon's size.

Google (GOOG -0.2%) has set aside up to $500M to bring its Shopping Express local/same-day delivery service nationwide, re/code reports.
Google hasn't confirmed the number,  but is open about its willingness to spend heavily on Shopping Express. ""You can very much expect that we are putting a lot of money into this"" says exec Tom Fallows.
Last month, Google expanded Shopping Express' reach to include overnight delivery for the whole of Northern California. Fallows says Google hasn't settled on pricing for the service, but says a sub-$100/year price wouldn't be surprising.
Amazon (AMZN -1.2%) charges $299/year for its Prime Fresh same-day service (currently in 3 cities, includes groceries). It also offers standard Prime subs in 12 cities same-day delivery for some products for a $5.99 flat fee.
Whereas Google is relying on retail partners such as Target, Whole Foods, and Staples to handle warehousing - Google's trucks pick items up from stores for delivery - Amazon is opting for a go-it-alone approach that's initially more costly/time-consuming, but could also be more efficient over the long run.
Among Google's apparent goals: Boosting sales of product listing ads by (in Fallows' words) ""closing the loop on locally available items,"" and obtaining data on consumer buying activity that could be later offered to marketers,
Google and Amazon already have a growing ad rivalry. Amazon, whose users are more likely to go directly to its site/apps to place an order (and thus bypass Google) than other online retailers, is stepping up its efforts to use its mountains of customer data to deliver targeted ads. Google, meanwhile, is expanding its arsenal of tools and services for e-commerce firms.

The European Commission is preparing an investigation into the corporate tax codes in Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The probe is examining the low tax rates global companies pay in the three countries, and will make known if their tax deals are allowed under EU law, or amount to illegal state aid.
If the investigation reveals that multinational corporations received the state aid, the commission could obligate them to pay it back, even though such requirements are uncommon.
The probe comes after yesterdays news that Apple used Irish tax laws to allow it to pay just a 3.7% tax rate on non-U.S. income during its last fiscal year. Other companies that will be investigated include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).

A source tells VentureBeat eBay (EBAY -2.3%) plans to shutter its once-hyped Now local/same-day delivery service. The site observes Now has already seen a string of setbacks: eBay's local commerce chief and East Coast operations head have both departed, and some early retail partners such as Best Buy are gone. CEO John Donahoe downplayed eBay's same-day efforts in February. The company was more upbeat in 2013, promising to bring Now to 25 cities by the end of 2014 with the help of U.K. acquisition Shutl. Today, eBay only says it's ""focused on supporting"" Now in its 5 current markets, and isn't ""announcing any new market expansions at this time."" Amazon (AMZN +1.9%) must be happy to see the report. Unlike eBay and Google (just expanded local delivery to the whole of NorCal), Amazon is relying on its own fulfillment infrastructure (replete with AmazonFresh vans) instead of 3rd-party retailers for same-day. Its strategy has higher up-front costs, but could also allow for more efficient delivery. eBay continues to trade lower following news of PayPal chief David Marcus' departure.

The new Indian government is likely to allow foreign companies to directly invest in the company's e-commerce market, Reuters reports. Currently, foreign firms are only allowed to run marketplaces for 3rd-party vendors.
A policy change could open the door for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to significantly expand its Indian presence, something it has long been interested in doing. Like eBay, Amazon currently runs an Indian e-commerce marketplace.
If Amazon gets a green light to sell its own goods, it'll face tough competition from local leader Flipkart, which recently raised $210M in funding. Snapdeal, a marketplace eBay has taken a big stake in, is also a major player.
With rising Web/smartphone adoption providing a boost, CLSA estimates the Indian e-commerce market will grow from $3.1B to $22B in 5 years. Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl notes only 0.25% of Indian retail sales currently happen online, compared with 6% for China and 9% for the U.S.

Shopping Express already provides same-day delivery to the entire Bay Area (inc. San Francisco), as well as parts of L.A. and NYC. Much like eBay's same-day effort, the service relies on retail partners to handle fulfillment; the current partner list includes Target, Walgreens, Staples, and Whole Foods.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been taking a very different approach to same-day, using its own warehouses to offer same-day in 12 cities (more launches are expected).
Amazon now only charges a $5.99 flat fee to Prime subs for same-day orders up to 150 lbs, and is testing out its own delivery network in a handful of metro areas.

FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is changing the way it charges to ship bulky packages; instead of charging by weight alone, all ground packages soon will be priced according to size, which effectively will raise prices on more than a third of its U.S. ground shipments.

Higginbotham argues CenturyLink's 56 global data centers and massive U.S. and international fiber networks will help it gain enterprise clients - the company claims its network allows it to provide outbound bandwidth pricing that's 50% cheaper than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN).
CenturyLink has 1K+ enterprise customers and is the second-largest U.S. provider of data center colocation services, behind Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). Its latest moves were enabled in part by recent acquisition Tier 3, an IaaS provider that tries to differentiate by simplifying service management and automation.
Nonetheless, CenturyLink still has to contend with Amazon's umatched mindshare, feature set, and developer support - Synergy Research estimates Amazon's Q4 cloud IaaS/cloud app platform (PaaS) share was north of 30%, and bigger than that of its top 4 rivals (Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce) combined. It also competes against other IT and telecom giants (Verizon, H-P, VMware), and independent players such as Rackspace.

With Google Play having over 5x as many apps as the Appstore for Android, Amazon is reportedly wooing developers with money, AWS support, app pre-load deals, and other incentives - Microsoft and BlackBerry can relate. Amazon is also working on ""a mechanism to automatically translate existing Android apps,"" but it's not ready yet.
""I don’t know how they’ll differentiate with Samsung,"" says one skeptical developer. With the smartphone market nearly 5x the size of the tablet market and still growing just as fast, Amazon might feel it needs to try.

2161,WSJ: Amazon smartphone arriving in September,"

Is the long-rumored Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) smartphone finally on tap? Sources tell the WSJ the e-commerce giant plans to begin selling a smartphone by the end of September after announcing it in June, and has been showing off demo models to developers.
In-line with past rumors, Amazon reportedly will include a display capable of showing 3D images (no glasses needed) with the help of eye-tracking tech and four front-facing cameras. Past 3D phone attempts didn't pan out, but the technology they used was less sophisticated than what Amazon is said to be relying on.
An Amazon smartphone would undoubtedly include access to the company's broad app/content ecosystem. But assuming Amazon continues using its home-grown version of Android, it won't have access to the Google apps/services (Now, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, etc.) that come bundled with Google's version of Android.
The phone would also enter a crowded smartphone landscape featuring Samsung, Apple, and a slew of Chinese OEMs (Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi, ZTE, etc.) competing aggressively on price.
A caveat: Two recent WSJ reports involving Amazon wound up being denied by the company.

Amazon Web Services (AMZN -3.4%) finished 2013 with 280 ""significant services and features,"" up from 159 in 2012 and 82 in 2011, boasts Jeff Bezos in his 2014 shareholder letter. He also notes AWS is now offered via 10 global regions and 26 ""availability zones.""
Amazon is counting on AWS' huge feature set (and the developer ecosystem surrounding it) to help stay ahead of rivals such as Microsoft, Google, and Verizon, each of whom continue to fire fresh salvos. Synergy Research estimates Amazon had a 30%+ IaaS/PaaS share in Q4.
Amazon's Appstore for Android now has 200K+ apps, up nearly 3x Y/Y. That still leaves it well behind the App Store and Google Play, each of which crossed 1M apps last year.
The number of 3rd-party sellers using Amazon's fulfillment services rose 65% in 2013. Bezos also says a survey found nearly 3/4 of merchants signing up for Amazon's fulfimment services saw a 20%+ sales jump from doing so. 3rd-party sellers made up 39% of Amazon's Q4 unit sales.

Search ad-driven same-store sales, dominated by traffic from Google's (GOOG +3%) AdWords, rose 11.2% vs. 4.3% in February and 10.3% in January. Clicks were flat due to a shift towards Google's Product Listing Ads (PLAs). Ad prices fell 7% (soft smartphone ad prices are a likely factor), click rates rose 2%, and average order value rose 5%.
PLA-driven same-store sales rose 34.5%. Though that's down from February's 48% and January's 62.8%, ChannelAdvisor chalks it up to ""a normal aging of the program,"" given PLAs only launched in late 2012.

The company is counting on Azure's hybrid cloud support, along with its ability to play well with various on-premise Microsoft software (as show by today's new features) to help wrest share from 800-lb. gorilla Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon, for its part, pitches enterprises on its still-unmatched public cloud feature set and support for 10 regions.

The rumors were true: Amazon's (AMZN +0.6%) new streaming set-top will support ""thousands"" of Android games by next month (live blog). To play them, Amazon is providing an optional $40 controller that comes bundled with 1,000 Amazon coins (normally retails for $9.50) to buy games with, and a tablet controller app. A small number of titles can be played with the Fire TV's bundled remote.
Electronic Arts (EA -0.9%), Take-Two's (TTWO +0.2%) 2K Games unit, Sega, Gameloft, and Disney are among the game developers on board. Amazon, as reported, will also be developing its own titles.

Should Sony (SNE -0.6%), Ninetendo (OTCPK:NTDOY), and Microsoft be worried? The Fire TV, and perhaps also gaming set-tops reportedly on the way from Apple and Google, are unlikely to compel hard-core gamers to ditch their PS4s and Xbox Ones.

Surprise, surprise: Amazon Web Services (AMZN -3.2%) has barely waited 24 hours to respond to Google's huge cloud infrastructure/app platform price cuts. AWS' cuts are the 42nd in its history.
Prices for popular options for Amazon's EC2 cloud computing service have been lowered by 30% or more, and prices for its S3 storage service have been cut by an average of 51%. Its RDS database service is seeing a 28% cut on average, and its Elasticache caching service a 34% price drop.
Prior to Amazon's move, cloud analytics firm RightScale pointed out Google's cuts made its computing services much cheaper than Amazon's in many (but not all) cases. RightScale also observed Google is guaranteeing future cuts will be automatically passed on to those making reserved instance commitments, something not the case with Amazon.
AWS is also: 1) Announcing it has received DoD certification. Amazon already has FedRAMP government clearance, and is building a private cloud for the CIA after fending off an IBM protest.  2) Making its WorkSpaces PC virtualization solution (announced last fall) generally available. 3) Rolling out a new server instance (called R3) that supports up to 244GB of RAM and SSDs.

The launch of an ad-free Amazon music service that's bundled with Prime would have big implications for market leader Spotify (possibly prepping for an IPO), and could also affect streaming radio leader Pandora (NYSE:P).

While advertising is largely a sideshow for Apple - Tim Cook has said iAd's main goal is to help developers make money - Amazon wants to use its oceans of data to mount a challenge to 800-lb. gorilla Google, as well as drive more e-commerce activity.
Nonetheless, Amazon has been cautious about sharing transactional data with ad agencies. One exec says Amazon hasn't agreed to a request to ""divulge data about what's in shoppers' carts to inform ads."" Another suggests the company could be more proactive in providing case studies.

S&P is the only firm to change its rating, cutting shares to Sell.

Benchmark remains optimistic about long-term margin expansion, and believes Amazon will still deliver 32% OIBDA growth in Q1. The firm chalks up Q4's major slowdown in EGM revenue growth (23% vs. 29% in Q3) to aggressive holiday season electronics discounting.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) states on its Q4 CC it's thinking of raising Amazon Prime's price for U.S. subs (currently $79/year) by $20-$40/year.
The remark follows a 2013 in which Prime, from all indications, saw tremendous growth; Macquarie recently confirmed Amazon now has 20M+ Prime subs. Amazon's October decision to hike its free shipping minimum by $10 to $35 may have led to a late-year pickup in Prime sign-ups.
Though off their AH lows, shares continue trading lower in response to Amazon's Q4 miss and largely below-consensus revenue guidance. North American and international revenue growth rates of 26% and 13% Y/Y represent slowdowns from Q3 levels of 31% and 15%.

Amazon launched a payments solution for 3rd-party merchants in October, and is reportedly also working on a Kindle-based checkout system for retailers. TechCrunch observes a P2P system could help Amazon reach ""unbanked"" customers; PayPal has already made some efforts to win their business.
Separately, re/code reports PayPal is ""pitching"" Apple on offering white-label services (fraud detection, processing, etc.) for its planned mobile payments service. But two of the site's sources state it's unlikely Apple would have any need for PayPal.

Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) has taken a low-key approach to marketing Prime Instant Video even as its content library has swelled to include 40K+ movies and TV episodes, but that might be starting to change. The company recently began airing a TV ad (video) trumpeting Prime Instant's library and relatively low cost.
Prime Instant comes bundled with a $79/year Amazon Prime subscription. As with many other things, Amazon has provided few details about usage rates for the service, which the company has spent hundreds of millions (if not more) to build out.
The fact Amazon doesn't provide a monthly subscription option for Prime has held back Prime Instant's growth relative to Netflix (NFLX -1.8%) which had 31.1M U.S. subs at the end of Q3. But with Prime subscription growth having apparently picked up lately, the service is nonetheless now available to quite a few U.S. consumers.

FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and the USPS also had their own glitches. The spottier-than-normal delivery record this year falls on the shoulders of the retail sector not shippers. What to watch: Online retail tracking firm StellaService reports that sellers such as Zappos, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Victoria's Secret (NYSE:LB) scored well in meeting aggressive deadlines, although the cost may be high. Many of the firms upgraded late-ordering customers to express shipping to avoid a customer service backlash. Next year, deadlines may be earlier and holiday margins higher.  ",2013-12-27
2239,"Amazon provides stats on mobile use, Prime, e-books, Appstore","

Amazon (AMZN +0.3%), which has been infamously secretive over the years when it comes to sharing business details, has provided a handful of interesting stats in a PR discussing the company's holiday season and full-year performance.
Some noteworthy figures: 1) Over half of all Amazon shoppers used a mobile device during the holiday season. 2) 1M+ Prime subs were added during the third week of December, and there are now ""tens of millions"" of subs altogether. 3) 200K+ ""exclusive"" books were added to the Kindle store in 2013, and 150 authors sold 100K+ copies of their books via Kindle Direct Publishing. 4) The number of apps in Amazon's Appstore for Android more than doubled in 2013, and is now above 100K (still well below Google Play).
Research firm CIRP recently estimated Amazon had 16.7M Prime subs, up 72% Y/Y. The company's October decision to hike its free shipping minimum to $35 may have led to a pickup in subscriptions.
Shares are edging higher on a day that has also seen ChannelAdvisor provide favorable sales data for its clients' Amazon sales. Rival eBay, by contrast, is selling off.

 UPS (NYSE:UPS) admits it suffered shipping delays after an unexpected surge in packages and bouts of wintry weather across the nation strained the company's system. Packages intended for pre-Christmas arrival are still being delivered. Execs say UPS easily delivered more than the 132M packages it forecast. The delays forced Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to send letters of apology to affected holiday shoppers along with shipping refunds and $20 gift cards. The financial impact on Amazon wasn't disclosed.  ",2013-12-26
2241,Latest read from ChannelAdvisor,"
 Data from ChannelAdvisor shows slowing sales momentum during the third week of December for the retail clients the firm tabulates e-commerce activity on. Tracked sales through eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) were up 9.6% for the post-Thanksgiving period through the third week of December, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw a 25.2% gain through ChannelAdvisor's system. Both marks indicate a decelerating trend for the periodeBay may have lost some ground as other retailers offered more extensive expedited shipping options. ChannelAdvisor shifted the comparable tracking dates to align the Thanksgiving period holiday.  ",2013-12-26

 A last-minute surge in online shopping and bad weather left major retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) unable to fulfill guarantees to deliver packages in time for Christmas. IBM estimates that Internet sales jumped 37% on year over the pre-Christmas weekend. UPS (NYSE:UPS) was particularly caught out. ""The volume of air packages in the UPS system did exceed capacity as demand was much greater than our forecast,"" a UPS spokeswoman said. FedEx (NYSE:FDX)  was also affected, although the company said that it wasn't suffering significant delays. Amazon is refunding shipping charges to affected customers and providing a $20 gift card, while Kohl's will pay the full cost of all goods that arrive late.  ",2013-12-26
2243,Retail trend watch: Consumers trading down and buying online,"
 Wells Fargo bangs the same drum as other firms on the promotional fervor being seen in retail with its warning today that Q4 margins may disappoint. Analysts with the investment firm cite data showing mall traffic was off 9% for the first two weeks of December and think that even a late-month pickup in sales won't be enough to rescue the quarter. The consistent read on the sector has been that discounters (DG, FIVE, DLTR, FDO), e-commerce retailers (AMZN, OSTK, EBAY, NILE, BIDZ, SFLY), and membership warehouses (COST, PSMT, WMT) may have held up the best as consumers either traded down or shopped via devices.  ",2013-12-23
2244,Internet retailers move to stem product returns,"
 There's a little known secret amid the strong growth in online sales: up to a third of all purchase are returned, as estimated by retail consultancy Kurt Salmon. With customers not having to pay to send products back, UPS forecasts that returns will climb 15% this holiday season compared with last year. The trend, which can be very costly for firms, has prompted them to act. Clothing sizes are the biggest reason why shoppers return purchased goods, so companies have been using past transactions to give consumers gentle reminders about which size fits them the best. Macy's (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) are among the those who use data to ensure that shoppers choose what will hopefully be the right fit. Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers offer customers ""appeasements"" such as gift cards or small discounts to persuade them to not return their acquisitions.  ",2013-12-23
2245,Wedbush: Amazon Prime plucking sales away from Best Buy,"
 In a note to clients yesterday, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter forecast more accessories sales shifted to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this holiday season with Amazon Prime growing to an estimated membership count of 15M-17M. Directly in the line of fire is Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). The investment firm expects Best Buy to deliver a holiday period sales comp of 1.5% which includes a significant boost from the wave of new gaming consoles. Wedbush still rates BBY at Underperform, but has taken the edge of its previous dire outlook. The 12-month price target on BBY is doubled to $18.  ",2013-12-20
2246,Google's shopping ads gain traction amid mindshare battle with Amazon,"

A year after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) began charging companies for Google Shopping product listings, the listings (i.e. PLAs) are providing a boost to Google's search ad sales, and also aiding its battle against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for e-commerce traffic.
On both PCs and mobile devices, PLAs, which are accompanied by images and placed in a separate box, appear at the top of Google search result pages for product queries. Adobe's ad research arm estimates the ads are clicked on 34% more often than text search ads, and ad services firm Kenshoo estimates each dollar spent on PLAs produces $9 in sales.
The number of U.S. PLAs tracked by Jefferies has risen 99% Y/Y to 236K, and the number of advertisers using them 55% to 8.7K. Those figures exclude a mobile PLA product that was recently launched. Also: ChannelAdvisor reports seeing triple-digit Y/Y growth in holiday PLA spend by clients.
Though Amazon spends a healthy amount on Google search ads (inc. PLAs), the fact consumers are more prone to visit Amazon directly and bypass Google search has made the share-gaining e-commerce giant an indirect threat to Google's ad sales. In addition, Amazon's own e-commerce ad ambitions have been growing.

China will represent the fourth Asia-Pac region AWS has set up shop in, and the tenth globally. A number of major Chinese tech/electronics companies, including Qihoo, Xiaomi, NQ Mobile, and TCL, are already AWS clients.
Competition will be provided by Microsoft's Window Azure, which launched in China earlier this year., and by Alibaba, whose AliCloud IaaS platform (launched in '09) has reeled in many clients.

 ShopperTrak reports retail sales fell 0.8% Y/Y last week on traffic that was almost 20% thinner as the shoppers that did venture out were all business. The retail-watching group says the wintry weather mix was a big factor and predicts a decent snap back in traffic this week.
The opposite effect could be in play with Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY -0.9%). The e-commerce tracking data for the two companies continues to dazzle as the typical post-Cyber Monday lull has been avoided. If there is a minor dip, analysts think it could be this week with decelerating Y/Y sales growth from the pair's dizzying pace.

Google now controls over 100,000 miles of cable around the world, well above Sprint's network of under 40,000 miles. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also been investing heavily in Internet infrastructure as they look to support their cloud-computing services.

 A strategy by Whole Foods Market (WFM +0.2%) to enter smaller markets appears to be paying off in the early stages, notes Barclays. The company's willingness to bring in products from local vendors and success with its prepared foods sections is helping to offset some of the stigma over premium pricing. What to watch: Whole Food's march toward a store count of a thousand will increasingly include more locations in small- and medium-sized cities. Signs that the consumer shift toward organic and food consumption includes these markets could give the grocery store chain an edge as it faces intense pricing pressure from Target and Wal-Mart. The pickle for WFM is how to keep sales percolating (FQ4 SSS growth 5.9% vs. 7.1% in FQ3) without misfiring on its branding in the new markets.

Redbox Instant (VZ, OUTR) could be the next streaming service to bring on TV shows for binge viewing, according to media buzz. The read-through for broadcasters (CBS, AMCX, FOXA, DIS, CMCSA) is mixed.

The estimate meshes with a recent report from Dan Rayburn, who was told by an Amazon insider the e-commerce giant ended Q3 with 15M+ Prime subs.
Amazon's October decision to hike its minimum free shipping order size to $35 from $25 could be fueling a pickup in Prime subscriptions (free two-day shipping for $79/year, no order minimum). More recently, Amazon struck a deal with the USPS to enable Sunday delivery for Prime subs in major metro areas.
If CIRP's estimate is reasonably accurate, it means close to 17M Amazon accounts now have access to Prime Instant Video (whether they're using it is a whole other question). Rival Netflix (NFLX -0.2%) ended Q3 with 31.1M U.S. streaming subs.
Separately, Janney estimates Kiva Systems' robots could lower Amazon's per-order fulfillment costs by 20%-40% from a current $3.50-$3.75. That, in turn, spells estimated cost savings of $458M-$916M/year.

In addition, the transaction fee charged to the latter group will double to 2%.
Amazon has already carried out a string of fee hikes for its on-site fulfillment services. But while merchants have griped, the hikes haven't yet halted Amazon's share gains against EBAY and other rivals. 3rd-party sales accounted for 40% of Amazon's Q3 paid units, and are a relatively high-margin business.

Amazon is also lower, as are Red Hat (RHT -1.3%) and data center owner Equinix (EQIX -0.9%). Like Racksapce, Red Hat is a major supporter of the OpenStack IaaS platform.
In addition to cutting prices, Google has greatly expanded Compute Engine's feature set. The company has added support for more Linux variants (inc. Red Hat and rival distributions) and popular app deployment tool Docker, and is launching a 16-core computing instance and high-I/O storage instances for intense workloads.
Amazon, which just unveiled several new cloud services, still has a big edge on Google in terms of scale, feature set, and developer support. But consulting firm Scalr declares Google to be ahead of Amazon in terms of performance and reliability. They're considered even on pricing.
Moreover Google's IT and engineering resources, together with its expertise in creating cheap, high-performance, data center hardware, should make it a solid rival in time, at least for basic computing/storage services.

 The Supreme Court declines to hear a case brought by Amazon (AMZN -0.6%) and Overstock.com (OSTK +0.9%) on whether a New York state law that forces online retailers without a physical presence to collect sales tax is legal.

2275,Thanksgiving weekend sales fall,"
 The amount of money that consumers spent over the Thanksgiving weekend is estimated to have slipped 2.7% to $57.4B, the National Retail Federation says. The drop is in contrast to estimates that Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales at brick-and-mortar stores rose 2.3%. The average consumer spent $407.02 over the whole weekend, down 3.9% from last year. The number of shoppers increased to 141M people from 139M. The fall in spending came after retailers warned of a difficult holiday season and was due to the aggressive bargains on offer, a trend that is expected to continue. However, the NRF maintained its forecast that retail sales will grow 3.9% for the whole holiday whole season. Online sales climbed 17.3% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, ComScore estimates, noting that the latter day attracted a record $1.2B in spending. The research firm expects Internet sales to  rise 16%  for the whole of the holiday season. The most visited sites on Black Friday were those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Target (NYSE:TGT). Total e-commerce sales hit $20.6B in the first 29 days of this holiday season, up 3.1% from last year, although this year includes more days. Today is Cyber Monday, which the NRF reckons will attract 131M shoppers vs 129M last year. But as with Black Friday, Cyber Monday has started a day early, with J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) and Macy's (NYSE:M) among those who began related promotions yesterday. Target has gone further and created ""Cyber Week."" More on Thanksgiving sales.

2276,More from Amazon's 15 minutes on 60 Minutes,"
 A sitdown between 60 Minutes and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Jeff Bezos makes it clear the company plans to keep investing aggressively in new businesses and stick to its philosophy of customer ""centricity"" to use the CEO's terminology.
While Amazon's AWS business might be the profit-maker for the company, it doesn't appear to be the direction of Bezos' passion. But an interesting aside was Bezos calling the service for one top customer, the CIA, a ""private"" cloud. On distribution 101: A walk-through through one of the company's massive fulfillment centers reveals the deep extent that algorithms determine the placement of products to maximize the use of physical space. It's an edge that  feeds to AMZN's bottom line like no other retailer, note analysts. On set-top boxes: Though Bezos won't directly answer question on whether or not Amazon's secret Lab 126 is working on a set-top box which could be a disrupter to the Pay-TV industry, his non-answer was revealing in its tone. The exec thinks crowdsourcing is a better way to pick content than the old Hollywood studio system - a vision that falls in line with a set-top play. Previous: Amazon's next big thing. Look up.

2277,Amazon planning to deliver products using drones,"

An example of truth being stranger than fiction? During a 60 Minutes interview, Jeff Bezos (NASDAQ:AMZN) states Amazon is experimenting with fulfilling small orders (5 pounds or less) using autonomous drone aircraft. The drone service, called Prime Air (video), is expected to go live in 4-5 years.

Bezos hopes the drones will allow Amazon to deliver goods within 30 minutes. ""I know this looks like science fiction. It’s not.""
The initiative is bound to face some regulatory challenges; FAA rules for drone flights in U.S. airspace are expected to be ready in 2015. There's also the question of how effective the service will be in densely-populated urban areas.
But if Amazon pulls it off on a large scale, it would give the company's same-day delivery efforts (bolstered by AmazonFresh) a boost as it contends with rivals (such as Google and eBay) who are partnering with major retail chains to enable same-day.
As the Kiva Systems acquisition demonstrated, Amazon is a fan of using robotics to improve fulfillment times and efficiency. And as its recent USPS Sunday-delivery deal showed, the company doesn't mind spending heavily to achieve those goals.

2278,"Thanksgiving, Black Friday sales edge up","
 Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales at brick-and-mortar stores rose 2.3% on year to $12.3B, ShopperTrak estimates. The research firm reiterates its forecast that sales for the whole of the holiday season will increase 2.4%, the weakest growth since 2009. Foot traffic for both days grew 2.8% to over 1.07B store visits. Online sales +20% on Thanksgiving and +19% on Black Friday, says IBM. Mobile traffic accounted for almost 40% of all online visits on Friday. Mobile sales rose to 26% of total online sales on Thursday and were around 22% on Friday. Increased store openings on Thanksgiving seem to have eaten into sales on Black Friday, while online transactions again took business away from physical purchases. Anecdotal evidence suggests that consumers came with plans of what they wanted to buy, with the result that there was much less impulse shopping. (PR)

2280,More on Amazon Web Services,"

Synergy's estimates come shortly after AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched several new services for enterprises and developers at its re:Invent conference, covering fields as disparate as PC virtualization, app streaming, high-throughput storage, identity management, and data stream processing.
Following re:Invent, Evercore assigned AWS a $50B valuation, and predicted its sales would rise to $8.1B in 2015 from $3.5B in 2013.
The firm sees AWS' software marketplace, which allows apps to be used on a utility basis (Amazon gets a 20% cut), accounting for 13% of 2015 revenue, up from just 5% in 2013.
ReadWrite's Matt Asay thinks Evercore might be too conservative. He sees the rise of DevOps within enterprises (results in developers having more say in IT spending decisions) working to Amazon's advantage. ""DevOps, it turns out, is very real. And DevOps loves Amazon.""

2281,"Amazon dominates cloud infrastructure, cloud app platforms a 4-way race","

Though Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been seeing intensifying competition in the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, Synergy Research's numbers, like Gartner's, suggest AWS continues to dominate.

Synergy estimates AWS had a 35% IaaS share in Q3, or 5x that of #2 IBM, whose position has been bolstered by SoftLayer. All other vendors are assigned shares below 3%.
The situation is a little different in the cloud app platform (PaaS) market. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Heroku, long a major player, is given a market-leading 18% share. But AWS is close behind at 17%, and so are Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Azure (14%) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) App Engine (13%). All other vendors are estimated to have sub-5% shares.
Altogether, Synergy thinks Amazon grew its IaaS/PaaS revenue by 55% Y/Y, outpacing the 46% growth seen by the overall market. Moreover, AWS' IaaS/PaaS revenue is believed to have eclipsed that of Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce combined.
The report drives home the competitive challenges faced by Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), and other firms striving to take IaaS and/or PaaS share from market leaders.
Synergy thinks the traditional Web hosting market, which Rackspace remains well-exposed to, and which has been pressured by the IaaS market's rise, only grew 3% Y/Y in Q3.
Last week, Stanley Druckenmiller cited AWS and its disruptive impact on traditional enterprise IT as a reason for shorting IBM.

Meanwhile, in a quote garnering headlines, a U.K. work stress expert declared the reporter's evidence suggests the job carries ""increased risk of mental illness and physical illness.""
Amazon has responded to the story by asserting it's complying ""with all relevant legal requirements,"" and that an independent expert appointed by the company called its warehouse jobs similar to those in many other industries.
This isn't the first time a media expose has taken aim at working conditions at an Amazon warehouse.

2283,Cyber Monday preview: Winners and losers from the e-commerce binge,"
 E-commerce sales this holiday season will rise 14% to 17% this year to top the marks of the last three years, forecasts Jefferies. Cyber Monday sales are tapped to see +20% Y/Y sales growth. The ongoing channel shift away from brick-and-mortar becomes even more pronounced when auto, restaurants, and gas are backed out of retail sales tallies. Apparel sellers are forecast to be the hardest hit, although on-trend names such as Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Macy's (NYSE:M), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) should outperform. The strong Cyber Monday rush could hurt foot-traffic reliant chains such as TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Ultra Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), and DSW (NYSE:DSW) - according to some trends dug up by Placed.com. The positive read on e-commerce sales bodes well for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Retailmenot (NASDAQ:SALE), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Overstock. com (NASDAQ:OSTK), and Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE) - although high expectations are already likely factored into share price.

comScore previously estimated U.S. PC e-commerce sales rose 13% Y/Y in Q3, and that mobile sales rose 26%.
Amazon (AMZN), which soared last month following its Q3 report but gave back some of its gains in early November, managed to make new highs today. Shares are now up 48% YTD. eBay (EBAY +0.2%), which has been range-bound this year after a very strong 2012, closed up fractionally.

Several analysts argue Amazon's (AMZN +3.1%) cloud-based WorkSpaces PC virtualization platform could prove to be a long-term threat to Citrix (CTXS -5.4%) and VMware's (VMW -2.9%) on-premises offerings.
Nomura notes WorkSpaces is initially focused on SMBs, who tend to shy away from expensive on-premises deployments, rather than the enterprises Citrix derives a large portion of its sales from. But it still thinks the platform could become ""a serious and broader-based competitor if it ends up vying for larger enterprises."" Jefferies, meanwhile, calls WorkSpaces attractively priced and a threat to the majority of Citrix's business.
Stifel is defending Citrix. The firm argues Amazon is ""targeting the low-end of the DaaS market as it doesn’t offer the full range of features (or deployment options) that Citrix’s desktop solutions offer."" It's worth noting many cloud-based apps/services initially targeted SMBs before gradually moving upmarket.
Also: Amazon has launched AppStream, a service that allows apps hosted on its cloud infrastructure to be streamed to mobile devices (and perhaps eventually PCs). The service could end up acting as competition for Citrix and VMware's app virtualization platforms.
In addition to Amazon, Cisco's guidance is likely pressuring Citrix and VMware. Citrix and Cisco have an application delivery controller partnership, and VMware (though competing with Cisco in some areas) maintains a multi-faceted software alliance with the networking giant.
Last month, VMware bought Desktone, developer of a PC virtualization platform than can enable cloud-based services. VMware has promised to cross-sell Desktone's platform to its 11K service provider partners.

At its annual re:Invent conference, Amazon Web Services (AMZN +1.2%) has unveiled WorkSpaces, a PC virtualization offering that allows businesses to host virtual desktops on Amazon's cloud infrastructure.
PC virtualization/thin client software leader Citrix (CTXS -3.7%) dived following the product launch, but has recouped some of its losses following news the company is an AWS PC virtualization partner. Top Citrix rival VMware (VMW +0.2%) has fallen moderately, but is still near breakeven.
Amazon asserts WorkSpaces is easier to manage than traditional PC virtualization offerings, and also carries much lower up-front costs. AWS chief Andy Jassy: ""Virtual desktops are difficult to set up, they’re difficult to manage, you have to worry about the hardware, the virtual desktop infrastructure ... We wondered if there were an easier way.""
WorkSpaces is priced fairly aggressively - Amazon is charging $35-$60/month per user, depending on the plan, and doesn't require any long-term commitments.
Also: AWS, which has depended heavily on Internet companies for its early growth, has bolstered its enterprise chops by adding support for SAML 2.0, a commonly-used identity management protocol. Adding SAML 2.0 support makes it easier for enterprises to manage access to, and enable single sign-on for, AWS-hosted services.

At the same time, Amazon's aggressive spending isn't letting up. Fulfillment spend rose to 11.5% of revenue from 10.5% a year ago, and tech/content spend to 9.2% from 7.8%. TTM capex +$320M Q/Q to $4.59B.
Interestingly, eBay (EBAY -1.6%) is lower even as Amazon soars. When contrasted with Amazon's figures, eBay's Q3 Marketplaces numbers and Q4 guidance point to further share losses on a relative basis.

 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) grew product sales at a fast clip of 19.6% in Q3, and services sales rose even faster at 45%, but total operating expenses didn't just go away as the company's cost of sales rose 20% to $12.366B during the period.

The U.S. weakness, together with ramping investments, are blamed for eBay's below-consensus Q4 guidance.

Bill Me Later also fared well: transaction volume +30% to $1.01B, portfolio balance +37% to $2.56B.

The FT reports Amazon (AMZN -1.3%) is partnering with struggling HTC (OTC:HTCKF) to bring a line of smartphones to market. A source claims one of three devices discussed by the companies is ""at an advanced stage of development."" But another cautions there's no guarantee the product will be released, and the paper adds a 2013 launch is unlikely.

TechCrunch reported earlier this month Amazon is working on two smartphones - a high-end model with four cameras and a 3D UI, and a low-end model with software similar to that found in Kindle Fire tablets.
Any Amazon smartphone would have to contend with both strong competition from Asian Android OEMs (particularly on the low-end), and (assuming Amazon once more uses its own OS and app store) a lack of access to the Google apps/services provided to other Android vendors.

EBAY same-store sales growth, on the other hand, fell to 17.4% from August's 20.4% and July's 17.7%. Fixed-price sales +19.4% vs. +20.2% in August, auctions +8.4% vs. +7.8%, Motors +14.4% vs. +18.5%.
Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) numbers improved: search ad-driven same-store sales +1.8% vs. +0.2% in August, sales driven by shopping engines (such as Google Shopping) +10.6% vs. +7.7%.
However, the search ad-driven sales growth was fueled almost entirely by a 17% Y/Y increase in average order value to $113.72. Ad clicks fell 6% and orders 5%, and ad prices (NYSE:CPC) slipped 7% to $0.50. ChannelAdvisor speculates consumers shopping for cheaper items are relying less on search in favor of Google Shopping.

The service is aimed squarely at PayPal (EBAY -3%), which processed $29.8B in transactions on non-eBay sites in Q2 (70% of its total), and just expanded its reach by acquiring Braintree. Like PayPal, Amazon's pricing starts at 2.9% + $0.30/transaction.
PayPal has fought off competition from Google and other big Internet names. However, Amazon has 215M+ active customer accounts it can leverage to make a dent, and (judging by the company's description of its service) might be able to offer better on-site integration than PayPal.
Meanwhile, PayPal, which added several new offline payment tools and features to its mobile apps last month (I, II), has just announced one more: the ability to pay by having a QR code scanned. Aware this option isn't more convenient than swiping a credit card, PayPal suggests its real value comes from giving users the ability to redeem promotions and gift cards.

""We're making it up as we go along,"" says Wedbush's Michael Pachter, trying to model estimates amid Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) famous lack of detail regarding the costs of ventures like cloud-computing, Kindle, and same-day delivery of groceries. ""Revenues are growing quickly so there's progress, but what are the costs for all these businesses? You tell me.""
That investors give a free pass to nearly-profitless Amazon is great for consumers and bad news to the owners of companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), RadioShack (NYSE:RSH), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and even Kroger (NYSE:KR). But what happens to Amazon once the pass is revoked?
Analysts willing to venture a guess see earnings of $10.61 per share in 2016. To hit it, Amazon would need to continue to grow revenues at more than a 20% annual pace while expanding operating margins to 4% from 1% now. Plausible? Sure. But if the stock were to climb 10% per year over the next three, shares for the far more mature company would still trade at 40x those hopeful earnings.

 Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) Terremark unit, already a major player in the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, has launched new computing/storage services under the Verizon Cloud name. Like Rackspace and others, Big Red suggests it won't challenge 800-lb. gorilla Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) on price, but will emphasize reliability, performance, and user control.

Verizon says its use of an ""ultra-flat"" multi-tier architecture will yield better reliability than rival offerings, and lower the odds one resource-hogging server virtual machine will affect others. The carrier also promises to give customers more granular control over how much capacity they order.
The offerings are also more scalable than those provided thus far by Terremark, use open APIs to connect to rival platforms (inc. AWS), and make it easier to migrate enterprise workloads.
Nonetheless, taking on Amazon, recently estimated by Gartner to have 5x the compute capacity of all other IaaS providers combined and to also have ""the richest IaaS product portfolio,"" will be a challenge. Particularly given Amazon's pricing mentality.
Verizon's services rely on the open-source Xen virtualization platform. Terremark already has a partnership with top Xen supporter Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS).

The box will support both Amazon and 3rd-party content. That's a good idea, given Roku, Apple, and other Web set-top makers already support Amazon's content and popular 3rd-party sources such as Netflix and YouTube.
Amazon has reportedly approached media app developers and pay-TV providers regarding partnerships - as Netflix can vouch, the latter group has generally been cautious about partnering with streaming providers. No details yet about pricing; Roku's cheapest box goes for $48 on Amazon, and Apple TV has an MSRP of $99.

No word on whether PayPal plans to expand the test, or eventually offer some kind of permanent service (perhaps for a fee). The test appears squarely aimed at Amazon Prime (AMZN -0.2%), which provides free two-day shipping on millions of items on Amazon's site, in exchange for a $79/year fee.

TechCrunch reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is developing two smartphones: a high-end model with a 3D UI and eye-tracking support, and a cheaper device with software similar to that found in Kindle Fire tablets.
The high-end phone, codenamed Smith, is said to have four cameras to help track eye/head movements and ""give the impression"" of 3D, as well as ""an image recognition feature that lets users take a shot of any real-world object and match it to an Amazon product for purchase."" Samsung has already added eye-tracking functionality to some of its phones.
The WSJ reported in May Amazon is working on two smartphones. A later rumor stating Amazon wanted to offer a smartphone for free was denied by the company.
""Your margin is my opportunity,"" Jeff Bezos famously quipped. On that count, there's still plenty of ""opportunity"" for Amazon in high-end smartphones, a market where devices with ~$200 manufacturing costs frequently sell for $500+ unsubsidized.

Reviewers of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 7"" Kindle Fire HDX generally find the tablet to be a big improvement over the 7"" Fire HD. But while the reviews are positive, they're not quite glowing.
The Verge's David Pierce (7.8/10) calls the HDX's high-res display ""gorgeous,"" its X-Ray media information service ""insanely powerful,"" and its Mayday live video customer support service ""brilliant."" At the same time, the lack of Google Play support is said to make the HDX's functionality ""severely limited."" In addition to lacking Google's apps/services, there’s ""no Netflix, no Candy Crush, few to-do list apps or big-name games.""
Engadget's Brian Heater also takes aim at the lack of Google Play support, as well as the fact users have to pay an extra $15 to get rid of Amazon's ads. On the other hand, the HDX bested every Android tablet it squared off against in a battery life test. CNET (4/5 stars) praises the performance of the HDX's Snapdragon 800 CPU, as do others.
The Fire HDX's $229 price tag ($244 without ads) is soundly above that of many 7"" Android tablets backed by Google apps/services, as Amazon's own site demonstrates. Amazon is offering a revamped Fire HD for $139 ($154 without ads), but its specs don't measure up to the HDX's.

AllThingsD reports something similar, while adding ""it’s possible the project will be scrapped"" if a partner isn't found. Intel is said to be talking with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) about a possible deal.
Bloomberg's sources claim the project has slowed since Brian Krzanich, who is more interested in Intel's mobile chip progress, became CEO.
Intel has bought startups to strengthen its TV efforts, and has promised novel features such as a cloud DVR service that stores every item of programming for 3 days. But reaching content deals with media giants has reportedly been tough, thanks partly to the objections of pay-TV incumbents such as Time Warner Cable.

Google (GOOG -1.2%) is taking its same-day delivery service out of trial mode, and expanding its reach to cover the entire Bay Area (rather than just San Francisco, where Google's trial commenced in March).
Google is also launching Android/iOS apps for the service, known as Shopping Express. Retail partners include Whole Foods, Target, Staples, American Eagle, and Walgreens. The Web giant promises prices will match those found within stores, and will offer memberships for free until year's end (it's expected to charge afterwards).
Meanwhile, eBay (EBAY -2%) plans to bring its Now same-day service to Europe, starting with a 2014 London launch. In July, eBay announced plans to bring Now (first launched in Manhattan and SF) to several more U.S. metro areas.
Like Google, and unlike Amazon (AMZN -0.4%), eBay is looking to provide an infrastructure for local and national retailers, rather than directly handling fulfillment.
eBay is also launching a retail pickup service for items purchased through its marketplaces. The service, known as Click & Collect, is initially launching in the U.K, and bears a strong resemblance to Amazon's lockers, which were recently ditched by Staples and RadioShack.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched two new tablets under the Kindle Fire HDX name - a 7"" model and 8.9"" model - and has also given the Kindle Fire HD a price cut and slight refresh.
As rumored, the HDX tablets sport high-res displays - 1920x1200 for the 7"" model, 2560x1600 for the 8.9"" model - and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU. Amazon also claims the displays offer perfect color accuracy and the ability to optimize pixels based on the amount of available light.
Other features include Dolby (NYSE:DLB) audio, improved battery life, thinner/lighter form factors, and a 24/7 live video customer support service called Mayday.
The Wi-Fi-only 16GB 7"" HDX goes for $229 (same as the new Nexus 7), and a comparable 8.9"" HDX for $379. Higher-capacity and 4G models are also offered.
Amazon has also given the Fire HD a refresh, making it thinner and adding a faster CPU. More importantly, an 8GB model is now available for just $139, and a 16GB model for $169. The 16GB Fire HD sold for $199 when Amazon launched it a year ago. The standard 8GB Kindle Fire (now discontinued) sold for $159.
All of the tablets run on an updated version of Amazon's custom take on Android. The update adds a slew of enterprise-friendly management and security features.
The 7"" HDX begins shipping on Oct. 15, and the 8.9"" model on Nov. 7. On one hand, Amazon has put some clear effort into making its latest hardware stand out. On the other, tablet competition remains intense, and Amazon can't offer the  the popular Google apps (Play, Maps, YouTube, Now, etc.) that come bundled with Google-approved Android devices.
Also: Amazon is adding offline viewing support to Prime Instant Video, a feature that (for now) gives it some ability to differentiate from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Prime subs can download certain movies and shows for free to watch within 30 days.
Initial offline partners include NBC, Viacom, Sony, CBS, and Warner Bros.

Ex-WSJ reporters Amir Efrati and Jessica Lessin state Amazon (AMZN +0.6%), no stranger to subsidizing hardware, is looking to provide its long-expected smartphone for free to consumers.
However, they add ""there are many unanswered questions about the plan and what strings will be attached for customers,"" such as whether an Amazon Prime subscription will be required.
Amazon plans to sell the phone through its site, rather than through carriers. The company's smartphone efforts have reportedly been slowed down by a reluctance among manufacturers to anger Google by building a phone running a non-Google version of Android.

Digitimes and other Taiwanese media sources have been reporting for a while an Amazon smartphone is on the way, but most of their ETAs have already proven to be inaccurate.
If Amazon prices its phone aggressively, it could tap into a booming market for low-end/mid-range Android hardware, particularly in emerging markets.

Two months after U.S. district judge Denise Cote declared Apple (AAPL +0.2%) guilty of conspiring to fix e-book prices, and two weeks after the DOJ proposed e-book injunction terms, Cote has issued an injunction.
As suggested by the DOJ, Apple is prohibited from striking restrictive e-book pricing deals with publishers for 5 years, and is required to stagger its talks with publishers to prevent collusion. Also, an external monitor has been assigned for two years.
However, Apple won't be required to allow rivals to sell e-books through their iOS apps without giving Apple a 30% cut, as the DOJ had suggested. Amazon (AMZN +0.4%) has refused to sell e-books through its Kindle iOS apps out of an unwillingness to pay Apple 30% of its take.
Meanwhile, Reuters nearly backs up yesterday's Sina Tech report by reporting China Unicom (CHU -0.3%) and Telecom (CHA -0.6%) will begin selling the iPhone 5S/5C shortly after it goes on sale in the U.S., a major change of pace from the delays accompanying past Chinese iPhone launches.
Other news: Apple Insider reports Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) will be released at the end of October, and Quantcast and Piper estimate iOS' share of U.S. mobile browsing traffic has grown to 65%.

The service, known as Kindle MatchBook, initially supports 10K+ titles. (PR) After growing at a torrid pace for several years, e-book sales growth has slowed considerably, even though e-books still only account for ~25% of total U.S. book sales. Proposed explanations include the popularity of other reader options on tablets, purchase fatigue amongst e-book early adopters, and the fact some readers simply prefer print. MatchBook appears to be an attempt to give a second wind to e-book demand. Separately, Amazon temporarily provided a listing for its next-gen Kindle Paperwhite e-reader before pulling it.

CEO Eric Lefkofsky says Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is looking to buy at least 3 warehouses to support its direct e-commerce sales/fulfillment efforts. A Kentucky facility has already been singled out for acquisition.
Groupon's e-commerce sales have been taking off. Revenue for Groupon's Goods e-commerce platform jumped 69% Y/Y in Q2 to $241.8M, accounting for 40% of revenue and helping offset slumping daily deals sales. Moreover, Groupon's direct revenue (inc. a large chunk of Goods sales) rose 190% Y/Y to $190M.
However, this growth has pressured Groupon's gross margin. Lefkofsky argues creating warehouses and bringing shipping/fulfillment in-house will improve margins.

Last December, Groupon bought CommerceInterface, a provider of channel management software for retailers, manufacturers, and distributors, to improve Goods' order execution.
By creating a fulfillment infrastructure, Groupon is looking to mount a challenge to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been building warehouses left and right, and now derives 40% of its unit sales from 3rd-party merchants.

Sources tell Bloomberg Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has tested a mobile data network for its hardware using spectrum from Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT). However, they caution it's not clear if the tests, conducted ""in the vicinity"" of Amazon's Lab126 R&D unit (responsible for the Kindle line), are still ongoing.
Amazon has partnered with carriers to provide subsidized mobile connectivity for Kindle devices. Last year, the company introduced a 4G-capable version of the 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD that offered 250MB/month of data for just $50/year. But even a moderate data user (never mind a heavy Prime Instant Video user) will go through 250MB in a month quickly.
Meanwhile, carriers are seeing a pickup in 3G/4G tablet subscriptions thanks to the rollout of shared data plans.
The cost of any large-scale mobile network, even one limited to major urban areas, would run into the billions. Amazon's up-front costs would be much lower if it decided to lease capacity from an existing carrier and become an MVNO.
Hard-luck Globalstar has been petitioning the FCC for the right to use 80% of its satellite spectrum for terrestrial 4G mobile and Wi-Fi services. A ruling could arrive in the coming months.

Amazon's efforts to lower delivery times, both for its own goods and those of its merchant partners, have much to do with this spending binge.

Though its Windows sales have fallen, Microsoft has been seeing solid billings growth for enterprise app offerings such as Dynamics, Exchange, Lync, and SharePoint.
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rose to 10% from 6%. The company posted 25% Y/Y billings growth in FQ1, and is reporting FQ2 results on Aug. 29.
On the other hand, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which is coming off two quarters of license revenue misses and is reportedly dealing with salesforce turmoil, fell to 23% from 30%. Archrival SAP fell slightly to 15% from 16%.
The cloud migration continues: 46% of respondents said their companies are using cloud/SaaS apps, up from a prior 38%. Not surprisingly, companies are more comfortable moving CRM and HR apps to the cloud (Salesforce and WDAY have led the way) than moving ERP apps (SAP's stronghold in the on-premise world).
Also, 60% said their firms are using or considering a cloud app platform such as Salesforce's Heroku and Force.com vs. a prior 52%, and 48% said the same for cloud infrastructure platforms such as AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) vs. a prior 41%. Windows Azure competes in both realms.
Interestingly, in spite of the rapid growth SAP has seen for Hana, only 13% of respondents said their firms are using an in-memory database. Another 37% are considering, and 50% are unlikely to consider it.

2382,Mintel: Amazon on pace to dominate in Europe,"
 Online sales in Europe are forecast by research firm Mintel to double to €188B in five years, a forecast that bodes well for Amazon (AMZN -1.9%). Mintel says Amazon has grew its online market share by 60 bps in 2012 to 9.8% and should see more gains despite negative publicity in the U.K. and Germany. If current e-commerce trends were to hold, in 8 years Amazon will overtake German firm Schwarz to be the biggest retailer on the continent.  ",2013-08-15

 Speculation on a plan by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to bring AmazonFresh to the New York City area increases with a report a development partner of the company purchased a 964K square foot facility across the Hudson River in New Jersey. Also, AllThingsD notes the company has also posted help wanted advertisements for a New Jersey facility. If Amazon does bring grocery delivery to the Big Apple, it will run up against competition from PeaPod and FreshDirect.  ",2013-08-14
2384,ChannelAdvisor releases July client same-store data,"
 ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) clients saw a 24.9% Y/Y increase in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) same-store sales, down from 30.6% in June and representing the lowest growth rate recorded over the last 12 months (though still above total e-commerce growth). Merchants have been upset over recent fee hikes. On the other hand, EBAY same-store sales growth rose to 20.4% from 17.7% in June and 16% in May. Auctions -23.3% vs. June's -17.2%, but fixed-price (now a majority of sales) +20.3% vs. +18.9% and Motors +26.6% vs. +27.8%. ChannelAdvisor thinks eBay's new search engine (Cassini) is helping out. Are recent fee changes also helping? Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) numbers were a mixed bag. Same-store sales tied to search ads grew only 0.6% Y/Y, down from June's 5.1%. But comparison shopping (inc. Google Shopping) rose 12.9% vs. June's 10%. Also, ChannelAdvisor predicts search ad prices (CPCs) will rise thanks to the launch of Enhanced Campaigns, as ""advertisers are no longer able to bid lower for the lower converting mobile ads."" ChannelAdvisor shares rose another 7.5% today, and are now up 52% since the company posted a Q2 beat last Wednesday (previous).  ",2013-08-13

 BlackBerry (BBRY +9%) is now up 27% since Reuters first reported the company is thinking of going private. The company's enterprise value (excludes $3.1B in cash/investments) has grown to $3B. While Prem Watsa reportedly talks to both P-E firms and ""industry players"" about a deal, the NY Post reports BlackBerry would prefer to be acquired by a ""Google-like"" buyer rather than a P-E firm.

2386,"FastCompany: AmazonFresh a ""Trojan horse;"" 20 more markets expected","

In a cover story on Jeff Bezos and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FastCompany's J.J. McCorvey observes the company's new AmazonFresh grocery service (offered via its $299/year Prime Fresh free shipping plan) is a ""Trojan horse"" meant to give Amazon's broader same-day delivery efforts needed scale.
Amazon is also hoping its same-day infrastructure (replete with Amazon trucks) will increase its appeal to 3rd-party sellers (now responsible for 40% of unit sales) by lowering delivery times. Merchants already cite access to Prime as a reason for outsourcing fulfillment to Amazon (and giving a ~20% cut).

EBAY could prove a formidable same-day rival. Instead of building its own soup-to-nuts infrastructure, eBay is relying on dozens of offline retailers (inc. major national chains) to help handle fulfillment. Google is also dipping its toes into same-day.
Currently available in L.A. and Seattle, AmazonFresh is expected to expand to 20 more markets, including some international ones. SunTrust recently predicted an NYC launch will happen in 2014.
Also mentioned by McCorvey: Amazon is now able to ship items less than 2.5 hours after an order is placed; and wants to further lower than number; Prime now covers 15M+ items (up from 1M in '05); and Amazon is still ""evaluating"" how to use Kiva's robots.

2387,Amazon cuts Kindle Fire HD price in possible inventory-clearing move,"

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has cut the price of the 7"" Kindle Fire HD by $40 to $159. Prices for the non-HD Fire ($159) and 8.9"" Fire HD ($269) are unchanged. Last month, Amazon temporarily cut the 7"" Fire HD's price to $169.
The discount comes amidst reports Amazon will refresh its Kindle lineup this fall with higher-res models. Thus, the e-commerce giant could be trying to clear inventory ahead of a launch. The recent arrival of a refreshed Nexus 7 might also factor into Amazon's thinking.
Amazon, whose tablet shipments have been heavily skewed towards Q4, failed to make IDC's Q2 top-5 tablet OEM list (based on shipments, rather than end-user sales).
Meanwhile, TechCrunch has responded to Amazon console rumors by reporting Amazon could be building a living room box featuring a quad-core Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) MPQ8064 CPU (a set-top/smart TV-focused version of the APQ8064). The site also reports hearing Amazon has approached game developers about creating titles for its hardware.
One very plausible scenario: Amazon's rumored console and set-top projects are one and the same.

2388,Report: Amazon joining Android console fray,"


Sources tell Game Informer Amazon (AMZN +0.3%) is working on an Android game console, replete with a dedicated game controller, and plans to launch it later this year, ""most likely by Black Friday.""
Amazon will reportedly leverage ""titles already available on its platform."" Presumably the site is talking about the Appstore for Android.

VentureBeat says it has previously heard rumors of an Amazon console, and say the company has been hiring numerous game developers. However, the site adds a couple of its sources ""weren’t sure if Amazon was serious about the project.""
Crowdfunded startup Ouya recently launched a $99 Android console to mixed reviews, and the WSJ has reported Google is working on its own Android console. Apple has added game controller support to iOS 7, which could open the door to console-like home gaming (perhaps via Apple TV). Meanwhile, Nvidia has launched its Shield handheld Android console.
Developer support for controller-based Android gaming remains an issue. But the recent surge in hardware activity could change the situation quickly.

2390,NSA revelations costing U.S. cloud-computing providers,"
 U.S. cloud-computing companies could miss out on $21.5-35B of revenues over the next three years because of concerns about how U.S. authorities such as the National Security Agency have been accessing the firms' user data. The estimate comes from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation think tank.
Companies that could be affected include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There's increasing evidence that non-U.S. firms have been canceling orders and limiting their use of U.S. cloud service providers. In a membership survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, 10% of non-U.S. respondents said they had ended a project with a U.S. cloud company, while over half said they would be less likely to use one.

Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) opposition to unions, in particular, hasn't gone over well with continental politicians and labor groups.
A figure at trade union Uni Global: ""In Germany, the idea that warehouse workers are going to be getting opposition from an employer when it comes to the right to organize, that’s virtually unheard-of.""
Amazon argues unions will hurt the speed at which the company can embrace new technologies (such as Kiva's robots) and fulfillment processes.
The complaints come amidst strikes by a portion of Amazon's German warehouse workers.

 A collapse of the bundled channel model would seemingly leave program providers such as Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB), Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), Scripps Networks (NYSE:SNI), and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) out in the wild as fees could rise and fall more abruptly as hit shows come and go. Disney's (NYSE:DIS) claims nothing could knock ESPN off its high horse (and high carriage fees) - but with NBC (NASDAQ:CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), and CBS (NYSE:CBS) needing high-profile sports events on their schedule, the cost of future licensing deals could soar. Don't forget about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Along with +30M subscribers in the U.S., even old-school cable stalwart Dolan admits he is a fan of the streaming service. Disruption in the cable/satellite market could lead to some cord-cutting and extra subscriptions for Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.  ",2013-08-5
2393,DOJ proposes e-book remedies for Apple case,"


The DOJ wants Apple (AAPL +0.3%) to terminate its existing deals with five top book publishers, and to ""refrain for five years from entering new e-book distribution contracts which would restrain Apple from competing on price.""
It also wants Apple to be ""prohibited from again serving as a conduit of information among the conspiring publishers,"" and from entering into content deals that are likely to raise competitor content prices.
In a positive for Amazon (AMZN -0.3%) and Barnes & Noble (BKS -0.1%), the DOJ also proposes Apple allow e-book rivals to ""provide links from their e-book apps to their e-bookstores"" for two years. Such a requirement would give Amazon and B&N a way to sell e-books on iDevices without giving Apple a 30% cut. Amazon has been trying to avoid paying Apple via its Kindle Web apps, but that's an imperfect workaround at best.
