10,Helmerich & Payne forms new tech entity in bid for better well performance,"

Helmerich &��Payne (NYSE:HP) says it has formed a new business entity, H&P Technologies, to be used to drive development of advanced technologies and directional drilling automation solutions, resulting in greater reliability and well performance.
HP says a key benefit of its performance-driven drilling services is the reduced  positional uncertainty in the directional drilling process and that the technology can be used on any rig, regardless of the drilling or service provider.
HP also said it acquired Scotland-based Angus Jamieson Consulting, a software-based, training and consultancy firm.

11,Helmerich & Payne +3% as SunTrust issues two-notch upgrade to Buy,"

Helmerich & Payne (HP +2.8%) is higher after SunTrust upgrades shares two notches to Buy from Sell with a $75 price target, lifted from $58, saying the recent correction in its stock price has created an attractive entry point.
While most oilfield services names anticipate a pause in activity over their upcoming few quarters, HP has the ""contracts in hand"" to continue delivering ""12 super-spec rig upgrades per quarter"" into Q2 of next year, says SunTrust's Ken Sill, who also points to the company's dividend providing downside protection for the stock price and for its ""strong balance sheet"" to provide an advantage when the new rig build cycle starts in FY 2020.
Also, Citigroup upgrades shares to Buy from Neutral with a $74 price target, up from $70, believing HP ""offers a great combination of offensive and defensive qualities,"" and Credit Suisse raises the stock to Neutral from Underperform, citing the economic benefit of superspec rigs and the surety of the dividend.

 Helmerich &��Payne (HP +3.2%) pushes higher after reporting better than expected FQ1 earnings and a 53% Y/Y revenue increase, HP says its contracted U.S. land rig count rose ~4% to 204 by the end of the quarter compared to a slight decline in the industry rig count, with spot pricing continuing to rise by ~4%, resulting in an 11% increase in adjusted average rig margin per day.

 A third to a half of the 440K energy sector jobs lost in the global oil industry collapse may never come back, as a combination of more efficient drilling rigs and increased automation is reducing the need for field hands, which will hamper Pres. Trump's promises for a flood of new energy sector jobs, according to a Bloomberg report. Rigs have become so much more efficient that the shale industry can use about half as many as it did at the height of the boom in 2014 to amass the same oil output; for example, Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), the world���s largest onshore driller, says it expects to cut the number of workers at each well site eventually��to about five from 20 by deploying more automated drilling rigs.

In today's earnings conference call, CEO Dave Lesar said HAL's North American revenue growth lagged the increase in rig count because the company elected to forgo unprofitable contracts, but that the growth this year would meet or beat the increase in the number of drilling rigs.The CEO also said oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year, a higher rate than most E&P companies expect; after crude prices rally, companies will demand equipment and crews at a certain location and at a specific time, resulting in shortages, Lesar predicts.""Animal spirits have broken free and they are running,"" according to Lesar.

Drilling companies will be the last to recover among the oil and gas industry when the recovery eventually arrives, Moody's says.

 The ""lower for longer"" consensus on crude oil prices is overly conservative, and prices will begin bouncing back next year, Guggenheim analysts say as they upgrade the oil services sector to Buy and see plenty of upside for the major players given current market conditions. Guggenheim is calling for oil prices to return to $100/bbl by 2018, and sees 10% upside across the board for oil services stocks in the next year resulting from the group's unique exposure to crude prices. Within the group, the firm prefers Rowan (RDC +1.8%) and Atwood Oceanics (ATW +1.6%), as their backlogs should help reduce near-term risk, RDC has no newbuild commitments and ATW is finalizing a contract in Brazil for one of its two uncontracted rigs, utilization in the Middle East (NYSE:RDC) and Australia (NYSE:ATW) should be resilient on a relative basis, and both have fleets that make them more interesting M&A candidates.

Cowen analysts believe further rate negotiations are ongoing and could affect other operators with units contracted to Saudi Aramco, noting that Rowan (RDC -4.2%) may be the most exposed since it has nine rigs currently working with Aramco; RDC secured three-year contract extensions in Sept. 2014 on four of the jackups, which could see reductions, as well as four units currently under negotiation extensions.

Gruber also thinks consensus estimates are too optimistic, pricing in a full recovery in one year; the Street expects HP���s land business to generate $400M in sales in FY 2016, which Gruber estimates would require a spot dayrate of more than $30K/day or a rig count of ~270, which would be within 5% of the prior peak. HP currently trades at 1.7x 2016 consensus price to book value vs. 1.1x for PTEN, 1.1x for Precision Drilling (NYSE:PDS) and 0.9x for Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR); Gruber says history suggests downside risk to 1x as HP's return on equity likely will fall to 3% in 2016.

 Helmerich & Payne (HP +1.3%) is upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform at FBR Capital but with a lower price target of $108 from $120.

122,Land drillers join offshore brethren with troublesome prospects,"
 Offshore drillers have company now that falling oil prices are hitting the shares of land drillers such as Helmerich & Payne (HP -3.7%), Patterson-UTI (PTEN -6.8%), Nabors Industries (NBR -4.7%) and Seventy Seven Energy (SSE -5%) - with good reason, Susquehanna analysts say. The firm views land drillers at considerable risk to estimate revisions, given high current dayrates and significant newbuild construction activity, which could be problematic if lower crude prices persist or a weaker outlook on U.S. E&P spending comes out of earnings season.
Nevertheless, the firm finds valuations much better in land drilling for now, and it prefers PTEN and NBR at a respective 3.7x and 4.5x 2015 EBITDA.  ",2014-10-9

 The latest fleet status reports from Diamond Offshore (DO -0.2%) and Hercules Offshore (HERO -3.8%), released after yesterday's close, appear to provide another sign that offshore drilling likely will get worse before it gets better. Raymond James analysts explain that DO's negative fleet status included a lower than expected dayrate on the ultra-deepwater rig Ocean Monarch for one year at $425K, below the firm's estimated 2015 rate of ~$450K; a convertible option to alter the contract to an 18-month term also was below expectations.
HERO's August fleet status included a contract termination; Raymond James had expected choppiness in the coming months through hurricane season, but says the termination and increase in potential rigs available is cause for further caution.

Cowen analysts say the $650K dayrate for the Ensco DS-8 ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship is well ahead of the expected low-$500Ks thanks to unique circumstances, but lower-spec ultra-deepwater assets are commanding dayrates as low as $350K with the current market weakness likely to last well into 2015.
