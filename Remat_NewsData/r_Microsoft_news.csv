 As part of today's hearing into FTC oversight, agency Chairman Joe Simons promised he would look into videogame ""loot boxes"" -- a method of recurring revenue that's growing increasingly important for big game releases. Such boxes, which in the game contain virtual items like powerful weapons or equipment, can be bought with real money and are a growing revenue stream for videogame makers faced with huge budgets for their games. Those boxes are ""endemic"" to the industry from console flagships to smartphone apps, Sen. Maggie Hassan said in the hearing.

        Microsoft (MSFT +0.1%) and Walmart (WMT +1%) are opening a joint engineering office in Austin, Texas as part of the recent five-year strategic cloud partnership.
               Engineers from both companies will work to develop new internal apps that utilize Azure and migrate existing operations to the cloud. 
               The office, named 4.co, will open in early 2019 and will house 30 total engineers in the same building as Walmart’s emerging technologies office, which has 50 employees. 
               Walmart CIO Clay Johnson tells VentureBeat the two companies are working on internal chatbots using Cortana’s framework. 
               Microsoft already helped Walmart install IoT sensors in the refrigeration/freezer systems in over 5K U.S. stores that create an automatic ticket if temperatures drop below a certain level, which can help prevent spoilage-related losses.

        Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to continue work on U.S. military projects despite employee protests, according to a blog post from President and CLO Brad Smith.                  Key quote: “We believe that the debate about the role of the tech sector and the military in this country has sometimes missed two fundamental points. First, we believe that the people who defend our country need and deserve our support. And second, to withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in a responsible way. We are not going to withdraw from the future. In the most positive way possible, we are going to work to help shape it.”                  Smith acknowledges concerns about government use of AI and says Microsoft wants to engage in public dialog on the subject. He also says workers who feel uncomfortable working on a project can transfer to another one.                Anonymous Microsoft workers protested the company’s bid on the $10B, winner-take-all Pentagon cloud contract.

 Big tech and social media can begin to fix a rack of problems they've created, Net veteran Jaron Lanier says, by shifting models to make the user the customer rather than the center of a lucrative ad model. Netflix has pointed the way to that being possible, Lanier -- an Internet pioneer who's now an interdisciplinary scientist for Microsoft (MSFT +0.3%) -- tells CNBC. Next week brings another round of visits to Capitol Hill by tech execs: Twitter's (TWTR -1%) Jack Dorsey is testifying before House and Senate panels, and Facebook (FB -1.1%) COO Sheryl Sandberg is attending the Senate hearing as well, while Google (GOOG -1.8%, GOOGL -1.8%) CEO Sundar Pichai looks to be skipping it.

Netflix proved it works,"" he says. ""We used to think, 'Oh, nobody will ever pay for a movie online, because you can get them for free.' But actually, if you're willing to pay for them, they get better. You get peak TV."" The current ad-supported business model has led in large part to social media being arbiters of speech, a role they're not suited for, he says. ""It's a terrible role.

 Amid a rough year on the user-privacy front, major tech platforms are ""aggressively"" lobbying the Trump administration to create a federal privacy law, one that would overrule a tougher California state law, The New York Times reports.

California's June law set a guidepost for the rest of the country on users' rights to know about what data is being collected and shared, but it hits the center of many Internet companies' ad-based revenue streams, dependent on such volumes of personal data. Top lobbyists for tech companies agreed with Facebook's Joel Kaplan that the California law could be more problematic than Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which spurred industrywide changes in privacy disclosures. Internet companies seem to have come around to the idea that some regulation on privacy is inevitable and want to have a hand in writing the friendliest possible rules.  ",2018-08-27

Expect a few more market-moving revelations as the meeting progresses. Check this page throughout the day for the latest updates.A couple of Buffett quotes early in the morning get things started in Omaha. Buffett on cryptos: ""When you buy Bitcoin, you are just hoping that the next guy will pay more; it will not produce profit itself. That is not investing, that is one kind of game."" Buffett on succession: ""We have to have the right person for Berkshire CEO. We may find it in a month or it may take six months. But it's important to have the right person."" Keeping it simple: ""Index funds are the best form of equity investing. If you consistently stick with them over decades, they will do wonders. We have not invested our cash holding in ETF because we would rather like to buy entire business.""Q&A highlights: ""The decline is faster than we thought it was going to be,"" says Charlie Munger, talking about the big drop in circulation at many of the local newspapers owned by Berkshire. Economically, it's not a huge deal for Berkshire, says Buffett, but he and Munger worry about the consequences for society.Asked why Berkshire has such a large position in American Express (NYSE:AXP), but not so much Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Buffett says the V and MC purchases were done by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and yes, he should have bought earlier and bigger.Of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) massive share buyback, Buffett says he's a big fan. Both he and Munger don't believe Apple could find suitable acquisition targets, so share repurchases are a better idea. Why never an owner of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?

        Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox chief Phil Spencer says the company will sell more Xbox One S consoles next year than the newly announced Xbox One X – and that was always the plan.

When an appeals court refused to hear the case, the owners asked for the case’s dismissal to get the appeals court to offer a decision.                The appeals court did and ruled for the console owners. Microsoft argued against the legality of that maneuver.   ",2017-06-12

Already in the mix, a NHL expansion team is due to debut in Las Vegas next year and the NFL is trying to lure the Oakland Raiders to the region.

 Videogame sales ticked up Y/Y, rising 1% as key new game releases reversed a trend of declines, according to NPD Group. Spending had been falling against tough comparisons with last summer's releases. But a strong release schedule, including a new year's Madden NFL and a high-profile release in No Man's Sky, rescued August from summer doldrums. Overall sales rose to $573.4M as a pickup in software slightly more than offset continuing declines in hardware and accessories. Hardware sales continued a downward trend, coming on the cusp of a console refresh cycle at Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Those revenues fell 6% Y/Y to $178.1M. ""The unit growth in sales for the Xbox One and the 3DS was not enough to offset the decline in spending on the PS4, Wii U and older consoles,"" says NPD's Sam Naji. ""The decline in unit spending was also compounded by the 7 percent decline in the ARP for consoles and a 22 percent decline in the ARP for portables.” Videogame software spending, including digital estimates, grew 8% to $273.7M. And PC game sofware rose 18% to $14.2M. Meanwhile, accessory spending dropped 5% to $107.4M. In individual games (ranked by dollar sales), new releases took the spotlight: Madden NFL 17 (NASDAQ:EA) topped the chart, followed by No Man's Sky (SNE) and Deux Ex: Mankind Divided (Square Enix).

Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there.""On VR: ""Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time, or less people would be interested in that."" He does, though, go on to note that Apple (AAPL +4.5%) has a lot of consideration for virtual reality as it relates to gaming and education.The company had reportedly assembled a large team of specialists within the fields earlier this year.While AR and VR initiatives have already been most notably underway at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Facebook (FB +0.7%), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) and elsewhere, efforts by Intel (INTC +0.4%), Snapchat (CHAT) and Line (LN +2.1%) have developed within the last few weeks, demonstrating broad increased movement throughout the space.

747,Videogame spending declines 26% as hardware falls off,"
 Videogame spending fell 26% Y/Y in June, facing tough comparisons against strong launches in 2015 and with hardware making up most of the decline, according to NPD Group data. Overall spending was $652.2M. Videogame hardware spending came to $181.5M -- down 42% as unit sales fell 32% and prices on average dropped 15%, the firm said. NPD Group has begun adjusting its report to include point-of-sale info for digital game sales made via PlayStation Network, Xbox Store and Steam, to reflect a fast-growing portion of industry revenues. That means for now that Nintendo sales and mobile sales, as well as other PC stores like EA's Origin, are missing and not projected. In software, both videogame and PC game software fell 20%, though last June featured strong launches like Batman: Arkham Knight. Overall sales (now including digital formats) came to $322M for consoles/portable and $27.8M for PC games including Steam. Accessories fell 6%, and interactive gaming toys (the lead accessory type) fell by 21%, mitigated somewhat by a 6% growth in headsets/headphones. In individual games (now ranked by dollar sales), despite the tough comps May launches had a good second month. Overwatch (NASDAQ:ATVI) continued to top the chart, followed by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens (NYSE:TWX). The inclusion of digital full-game sales gave GTA V a new boost. PlayStation 4 (NYSE:SNE) again was the top-selling console, over Xbox One (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Wii U (OTCPK:NTDOY).  ",2016-07-22

Jefferies' John DiFucci questions the price Microsoft is paying. ""While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost. Despite a new management team, this appears to be a similar playbook to previous material acquisitions.

Worried about a long-term decline in Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) on-premise software business, chairman John Thompson and other directors are ""pushing for a more aggressive shift"" towards cloud offerings, says Bloomberg.

Microsoft's commercial cloud ops (they include Azure and business Office 365 sales) were on a $10B/year run rate as of April, but that's still only equal to 10.5% of an FY17 (ends June '17) revenue consensus of $95.2B.
Microsoft has already rolled out a number of cloud apps and Azure services during Satya Nadella's time as CEO, as well as made some-cloud-related acquisitions. Could a larger deal now be considered?

Several vendors are still missing critical CRM components, the firm says, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a potential bidder as well. Acquisitions in the cloud sector have tended to focus on the multiples of enterprise value to the last-12-months subscription revenues, it says. Modeling several acquisitions over the past year and applying that multiple to Marketo ($198.9M in last-12-months sub revenue, and revenue growth of 38.1%) brings a share price of $44.35 -- 65.7% upside from the just-inflated closing price. Applying a standard error to the multiple brings a warranted price range of $37.03-$51.67 (38% to 93% upside). Now read Competition The Issue As Marketo Pivots To Enterprise »

Windows 10 now runs on 300M active devices, Microsoft (MSFT +0.4%) discloses. That's up from 270M in late March, and 200M in early January.

NetMarketShare estimates 15.3% of the global PC installed base is on Windows 10, compared with 9.9% on Windows 8.1, 3.2% on Windows 8, and 10.6% on Windows XP. 47.8% of the base is still believed to be on Windows 7.

Meanwhile, a ""PlayStation 4.5"" or ""PlayStation Neo"" is rumored as well. But while the older-gen systems got upgrades in hard drives, storage is plentiful now, so the new focus may be on a processor upgrade -- providing potential power for virtual reality and 4K, for example.

804,Q/A session with Microsoft expert Mary Jo Foley showcases its upside,"

UBS recently hosted a call with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) expert Mary Jo Foley, who has covered the company for 2+ decades. Highlights:
Q: How far along is the company in its transition to the cloud? A: Microsoft continues to show progress across multiple product fronts as the company manages its way through the cloud transition. The company is well on its way to management's stated goal of a $20B commercial cloud run rate by FY18, having  recently reached a $9.4B run rate at +71% y/y growth. We think the company gets there much quicker, but caution that MSFT's expansive customer base could present additional challenges. Evidence: FQ2 commercial cloud revenue accelerated to a >$9.4B run rate (up more than 70% y/y, w/ >350 of the Fortune 500 now using 2+ MSFT cloud offerings). This puts the business well above pace towards reaching mgmt's stated objective of a $20Bn run rate in FY18 (which assumes a ~35% CAGR). We note that this growth has been entirely organic (w/ no major acquisitions boosting numbers), and that at the current pace (~70% y/y growth), the company would reach this target ~1 year ahead of schedule.
Q: How much upside remains given share price appreciation over the past 12 months? A: MSFT shares have traded up ~30% over the past 12 months (vs. NASDAQ down 3%), but we still think there is room left in the tank, as the company is demonstrating product strength in several new categories (CRM + ERP, O365, security, IaaS/PaaS, BI/analytics), which we believe present MSFT with $185B+ of additional market opportunity.
UBS: MSFT is executing a balanced top- and bottom-line story, featuring CEO Nadella ""innovating"" and CFO Hood ""disciplined spender."" With a strong initial push, we see real benefits starting to show through in the numbers, including: 1) Unearned revenue building (flat in F15, but est. +11% in F16); 2) cost cutting measures taking hold, with opex flat (F14 to F16) and margins inflecting (~30% OM in F15, which we think can get back to the mid-30s); and cash flow trending in the right direction (1H16 FCF +9% y/y). The new era of MSFT is resonating with investors and we expect shares to continue to benefit from the move to higher-quality platforms and the company's aggressive push to the cloud.

820,Microsoft takes on Oracle and IBM by bringing SQL Server to Linux,"

Following years of running only on Windows-based operating systems (mostly Windows Server), Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) SQL Server database will be available for Linux, EVP Scott Guthrie discloses. ""We are bringing the core relational database capabilities to preview today, and are targeting availability in mid-2017.""
Enterprise Linux vendors Red Hat and Canonical provide positive quotes for Guthrie's blog post. Today's announcement follows a deal to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure, as Microsoft continues showing a greater willingness to support rival platforms in the Satya Nadella era. Linux, beloved by many Internet giants and startups, has been steadily gaining server OS share, to a large extent at UNIX's expense.
Bringing SQL Server to Linux represents a salvo fired at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), by far the largest player in the relational database market and long a Linux supporter. Microsoft is also looking to take share from IBM's DB2 and Informix databases, and - though many open-source aficionados will be a tough sell - better compete against open-source databases such as MySQL (controlled by Oracle) and MariaDB.
Guthrie also uses his post to detail new features provided by SQL Server 2016, which arrives on Windows Server later this year and will square off against Oracle's 12c database. Among other things, SQL Server 2016 is said to provide superior encryption features, in-memory database support for every workload (takes aim at both Oracle and SAP's Hana in-memory database), and better data warehousing, business intelligence, predictive analytics, and hybrid cloud support.

821,Report: Microsoft considered buying messaging upstart Slack for up to $8B,"


TechCrunch reports Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) considered buying Slack (SLACK), a fast-growing provider of enterprise messaging/collaboration apps and services, for up to $8B.
EVP Qi Lu (in charge of Office, Bing, Skype, Exchange, and SharePoint) reportedly pushed for a deal, but Bill Gates and Satya Nadella ultimately shot it down, with Gates arguing Microsoft should try to better compete with Slack by adding features to Skype for Business (formerly known as Lync).
Slack was valued at $2.8B in a 2015 funding round, and was recently reported to be looking to raise $150M-$300M at a $3.5B-$4B valuation. The company competes to an extent with newly-public Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), and monetizes its services through a freemium model. It recently claimed to have 2.3M daily active users (675K paying), up from just 520K a year ago, along with $64M in annual recurring revenue. (Slack's product page)
Continuing a recent trend of making nice with popular rival services, Microsoft recently struck a deal with Slack to allow Skype voice/video calls to be launched from Slack apps. The company has also moved to improve Skype's iOS/Android feature set, and to integrate a slew of Skype features with enterprise versions of Office 365.

How do you perk up employees after your firm's stock price falls off a cliff? LinkedIn (LNKD) Chief Executive Jeff Weiner is declining his 2016 annual stock compensation (a reported $14M) in order to pass it on to workers at the professional social network.
Up to Wednesday's close of $119.68, LinkedIn's stock had dropped nearly 38% since its disappointing Q4 results on Feb. 4.
Weiner isn't the only one to employ the strategy. Back in October, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey gave away $200M in stock to employees after steep layoffs and a battered stock price had taken their toll.

Microsoft (MSFT - unchanged) has begun taking pre-orders for its $3,000 HoloLens developer kit, and will begin shipping it on March 30. The kit comes with a handful of initial apps, including a Skype app, a 3D modeling app called HoloStudio, and HoloTour, an app that provides 3D virtual trips to global landmarks.
Microsoft has also revealed hardware specs for its first-gen augmented reality headset. HoloLens runs on a custom ""Holographic Processing Unit"", along with an ""Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 32-bit architecture"" CPU. It features two ""light engines"" (one for each eye) said to produce 2.3M light points, and contains Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi radios.
Other features include 64GB of storage, USB ports, four microphones for picking up voice commands, four cameras to ""understand"" a user's environment, a 2MP camera for capturing photos and videos, a Bluetooth-based ""Clicker"" accessory for controlling HoloLens, an ambient light sensor, and an ""internal measurement unit"" for detecting motion. Battery life under active use is a modest 2-3 hours, and the device's weight is 1.37 pounds.
Microsoft has already signaled it will initially target developers and enterprises with HoloLens, as it works to lower hardware costs and build out a software ecosystem. However, the company wants to eventually win over consumers as well - Satya Nadella once suggested HoloLens' commercialization will be ""a five-year journey.""

Atlantic Equities, BMO, Cowen, JPMorgan, Mizuho, Monness Crespi, Raymond James, RBC, SunTrust, and Susquehanna have downgraded LinkedIn (LNKD) to neutral ratings after the company offered weak Q1/2016 guidance with its Q4 beat, and suggested several factors related to hiring solutions, online ad, and subscription growth were to blame. Shares have crashed to levels last seen in 2012.
Raymond James' Justin Patterson, who previously had a Strong Buy rating: ""While guidance likely contains some conservatism, LinkedIn’s now provided cautious guidance for three of the past four quarters and earnings quality is poor (i.e. [stock compensation[ now represents >60% of EBITDA, with revenue growth decelerating). Thus, we believe the after-hours reaction is warranted and that LNKD shares are likely range-bound until growth reaccelerates, guidance volatility subsides, and earnings quality improves.""
Citi's Mark May (Neutral): ""While 4Q15 results could be characterized as mixed, three of the last four quarters have now included ‘issues’ ... Even considering mgmt’s history of conservatism, guidance implies a meaningful deceleration in revenue growth to the 20-30% range from 35-40% recently, as well as 30% incremental margins for 2016, below the 32% incremental margins in 4Q15.""
Pac Crest's Evan Wilson (Overweight rating): ""LinkedIn has rarely given investors a reason to own the stock in 1H and it has happened again ... we think its outlook will most likely end up being conservative as it usually is. We think for its data alone, LinkedIn is a worthy acquisition for any number of enterprise software companies at this valuation."" Wilson is, however, critical of LinkedIn's decision to shutter its standalone Lead Accelerator B2B ad product. ""Now Sales Navigator really is LinkedIn's only big near-term opportunity to materially increase the monetization of its data set. Ugh.""
BMO's Dan Salmon: ""[W]e came away from 4Q results with less confidence in our long-term thesis. Moreover, while US employment trends are still relatively strong, an uncertain air surrounding near-term hiring appeared to develop toward year-end ... Looking more closely at the long-term product roadmap, the path to engaging new groups of power users (B2B marketers, salespeople) has been bumpier than expected.""
Stifel's Scott Devitt (Buy, $220 target) is still a believer. ""Investors may question its strategy, but LinkedIn is narrowing its focus on high value, high impact initiatives and jettisoning those investments that do not provide acceptable returns. Although its marketing business will likely face distractions this year, we think LinkedIn’s talent, sales, and learning & development businesses are poised for a strong year.""
As is Needham's Kerry Rice (Buy, $200 target): ""[W]e believe our estimates could prove conservative due to: 1) LNKD’s core products remain healthy; 2) LNKD continues to have a strong product pipeline, including Lynda and Sales Solutions, the full potential of which we believe is yet to be realized; and 3) management continues to stay focused in terms of both execution and resource allocation.""

While discussing its 2016 guidance, LinkedIn (LNKD) says it expects its field sales hiring solutions business to see mid-20% growth in 2016, after exiting 2015 at 30% growth. The outlook is said to reflect ""continued pressure in EMEA and APAC given current global economic conditions,"" and single-digit growth for self-serve products. It also doesn't assume ""meaningful contribution"" from LinkedIn's Referrals and new Recruiter products.
Also: For its Marketing Solutions (ad) business, LinkedIn is shuttering its Lead Accelerator product as a standalone offering, and incorporating its technology into the Sponsored Updates ad product. The move is expected to have a short-term revenue impact. Nonetheless, LinkedIn forecasts Marketing Solutions will ""accelerate in 2016.""
Meanwhile, spending will stay aggressive: Capex will equal a high-teens % of 2016 revenue, and aggressive investments will be made for LinkedIn's Sales Solutions and Learning & Development (formerly Lynda.com) platforms.

844,"Microsoft gains as Morgan Stanley upgrades, sees healthy return profile","

Arguing a 3% dividend yield and an expected 10% FY15-FY18 EPS CAGR spells a 13% annual return profile, Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss has upgraded Microsoft (MSFT +2.2%) to Overweight, and hiked his target by $9 to $66.
A 7% revenue CAGR is expected from FY16-FY18, fueled by Azure, server/data center products, and Office 365. EPS growth, pressured in recent years by weak PC sales and the cloud transition (has pushed out revenue recognition and led to higher investments), is seen outpacing revenue growth with the help of buybacks, cost controls, and cloud gross margin expansion. Weiss: ""Microsoft has a strong public cloud positioning, datacenter share gains, a durable Office franchise, and less risk in Windows bolsters our confidence.""
The upgrade comes ahead of Microsoft's Jan. 28 FQ2 report. Last month, Goldman upgraded to Neutral after more than two years of staying bearish.

Update (4:26PM ET): With the Nasdaq dropping 3.4% on the day, Microsoft gave back its gains, and then some. Shares closed down 2.2%.

845,PC sales down strongly again in Q4; 2016 stabilization expected,"

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) could make a bid for storage array vendor NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and threat-prevention hardware/software provider FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) in 2016, thinks FBR's Dan Ives. Cisco/NetApp speculation has been around for a while. Meanwhile, Cisco has made several security acquisitions in recent years, and appears to be up for more, but has also launched products that compete with FireEye.
Ives also thinks IBM could bid for machine/log data analytics software leader Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and business intelligence/data visualization software firm QLIK. With a $7.6B market cap and high multiples, Splunk would be a costlier acquisition than IBM's traditional fare.
HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), meanwhile, is seen as a potential suitor for both Qlik and enterprise cloud storage/file-sharing leader BOX. And Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) a potential buyer of cloud ERP, HR, and e-commerce software firm NetSuite (NYSE:N). Larry Ellison owns a large stake in NetSuite (more SMB-focused than Oracle), and the company both competes and partners with Oracle.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has made plenty of acquisitions in the Satya Nadella era, is seen as a potential buyer of database security software and Web app firewall vendor Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), as well as of cloud vulnerability management and compliance software firm Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).

Microsoft (MSFT +0.6%) has bought Talko, a developer of iOS/Android apps that enable workgroups to collaborate via live and recorded voice and text. Terms are undisclosed.
Notably, Talko was founded by Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's former CTO and chief software architect, and someone once referred to by Bill Gates as one of the best programmers on the planet. Ozzie won't be rejoining Microsoft, but the rest of Talko's team will be coming on board.
Talko's technology will be integrated with both Skype and the Skype for Business (formerly Lync) unified communications platform. In addition to saving voice conversations, its apps let users tag and bookmark specific moments during a talk, and use a phone's camera to share related photos or live video. Saved content gets stored in the cloud, and cached on devices.
Microsoft has made a string of productivity app purchases in recent years, as it tries to keep Google and upstarts such as Slack (SLACK) at bay. Past deals include Yammer (enterprise social networking), Sunrise (calendars), Acompli (e-mail), and Wunderlist (to-do lists).

Bellini: ""We are increasing our out year non-GAAP EPS estimates, driven primarily by faster gross margin expansion in Office 365 and Azure. While we still believe EPS consensus for FY17 and FY18 are too high, given the ongoing successful transition to the cloud we do not see the multiple coming under pressure.""
She adds several 2016 catalysts exist: A continued successful cloud transition, gross profit dollar growth (in spite of cloud-related margin pressure), EPS growth, the diminishing of headwinds related to weak business PC sales and the Office 365 transition (pushes out Office revenue recognition), and accelerating dividend growth.
Shares are off slightly in spite of the upgrade. Bellini's upgrade comes a day after Microsoft made a fresh high of $56.79, before retreating a bit.

Hardware sales rose 11% to $1.12B after being roughly flat in October, and peripheral/interactive toy sales rose 6% to $357.7M after rising 18% in October.
Not surprisingly, Activision's (ATVI -3.2%) Call of Duty: Black Ops III  was the month's top-selling game, followed by Bethseda's Fallout 4. However, Activision's Destiny: The Taken King fell out of the top-10, after coming in at #7 last month.
Electronic Arts' (EA +1.2%) Star Wars: Battlefront, which recently saw a $20 GameStop price cut amid mixed critic and user reviews, was #3. EA also took the #4, #6, and #7 spots via Madden NFL 16, FIFA 16, and Need for Speed. Madden and FIFA were also #4 and #6 last month.
Take-Two's (TTWO -1%) NBA 2K16 dropped three spots to #5, while WWE 2K16 fell out of the top-10. Ubisoft's (OTCPK:UBSFY) Assassin's Creed: Syndicate and Just Dance 2016 were #9 and #10; neither was in the top-10 last month.

In return, HPE will ""serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings.""
The deal comes a month after HP announced it's shutting down its public cloud services ops, rather than compete head-on with well-established players such as Amazon (the market leader), Microsoft (#2), IBM, and Google. The company, whose on-premise IT service ops have been pressured by cloud adoption - enterprise services division revenue fell 9% Y/Y in FQ4 to $5B - added it's still committed to offering private and managed cloud services.
For Microsoft, the deal gives Azure the backing of HP's still-massive enterprise sales and IT services workforces. It follows a multifaceted Azure partnership with server OS rival Red Hat. Microsoft reported Azure revenue rose over 100% Y/Y in calendar Q3, but didn't give a figure.
HPE continues trading higher after beating depressed FQ4 sales estimates with the help of positive x86 server and networking hardware growth, and reiterating its FY16 EPS guidance (while guiding FQ1 below consensus).

 Walt Disney (DIS -0.8%) launched Disney Infinity 3.0 for the Apple TV today, and unlike many games for the box, it comes with a chunky controller usually seen with higher-end gaming consoles. That could prove a critical test of whether the platform could support more intense gaming, and present real competition to the top two consoles made by Sony (NYSE:SNE) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Most all games on Apple TV are controlled by the device's slender remote. But the Nimbus controller made by SteelSeries (specifically for Apple's device) features analog sticks and D-pads familiar to console gamers, and sells for $50 (but at a $15 discount in the Infinity 3.0 bundle). Disney's entry in the toys-to-life category has underperformed compared to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders -- also now on Apple TV -- but the combination of content brands that Disney can leverage for the free-form game, including Marvel and Star Wars, has kept hopes high for the platform.

Microsoft: ""This acquisition accelerates our ability to help customers secure their business data no matter where it is stored – across on-premises systems, Microsoft cloud services like Azure and Office 365, third-party services, and any Windows, iOS or Android device."" Secure Islands' technology will be integrated with Microsoft's cloud-based Azure Rights Management service, which (for $2/user/month) protects e-mails, Office docs, and other content from unauthorized access.

A unified OS appears to mesh with new Google CEO Sundar Pichai's worldview. Pichai, who once directly oversaw Android and Chrome OS, predicted on Google's Q3 call ""mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.""
It would also be similar to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OS strategy: Windows 10 serves as a common OS for PCs and mobile devices, with the platform's Continuum technology enabling universal apps whose UIs change based on whether keyboard/mouse or touch input is being used. Apple, by contrast, continues to reiterate it has no plans to merge iOS and Mac OS; Tim Cook famously referred to such integration as being akin to combining a refrigerator and a toaster.
Possibly contributing to Google's decision: Android is far more popular than Chrome OS, claiming 1.4B active users as of September and an 82.8% Q2 smartphone unit share (per IDC), not to mention a giant developer base. By contrast, IDC estimates Chrome OS has less than 3% of the global PC market (the education market is a strong point). Thus, officially expanding Android's focus to the PC market through an OS supporting universal apps and Google Play could provide a shot in the arm for Google's PC ambitions.

Update: Re/code follows up on the WSJ's report by reporting Google will start working with OEMs in 2016 to develop PCs running on Android, and that OEMs will still be able to build Chrome OS PCs if they want to.

After several quarters of providing light guidance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is singing a different tune today: The software giant has guided on its call for its three reporting segments to collectively post FQ2 revenue of $24.8B-$25.4B, in-line with a $25.1B consensus and likely sparking hopes of upside given Microsoft's history of guiding conservatively.
Productivity & Business Processes is expected to see revenue of $6.6B-$6.7B, Intelligent Cloud $6.2B-$6.3B, and More Personal Computing $12B-$12.4B. Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on revenue growth, after having a 5% impact in FQ1.
Though revenue fell 7% Y/Y in FQ1 due to PC weakness and cloud transition (pushes out revenue recognition), cloud subscription billings helped the unearned revenue balance (non-GAAP) rise 3% Y/Y (9% exc. forex) to $23.1B. The contracted but not billed balance was above $23.5B.
Also: Bing, once a large cash sinkhole, is finally profitable. Search-related revenue topped $1B in FQ1, with search ad revenue (ex-TAC) rising 23% Y/Y. Windows 10/Cortana integration appears to be helping: Nearly 20% of the quarter's search revenue came from Windows 10 devices.
Other details: 1) Office commercial product/services revenue fell 2% Y/Y thanks to the 365 transition. Office consumer revenue fell 13%. 2) Xbox Live monthly active users rose 28% to 39M. 3) Enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers more than doubled Y/Y to over 20K. 4) Windows volume license revenue fell 3% Y/Y, and Surface revenue fell 26% to $672M ahead of the Surface Pro 4 launch.
Microsoft is trading at $51.89 after hours.

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud reporting segment (one of the three main segments in Microsoft's new reporting structure, covers server products, Azure, and enterprise services) was easily the company's best-performing segment in FQ1, with revenue rising 8% Y/Y (14% exc. forex) to $5.9B. Segment op. income rose 14% to $2.4B. Azure revenue more than doubled Y/Y.
Productivity & Business Processes (Office/Office 365 and Dynamics apps) revenue fell 3% Y/Y (+4% exc. forex), with sales pressured by the shift from up-front licenses to cloud subscriptions. Op. income fell 7% Y/Y to $3.1B. Office 365 consumer subs grew by ~3M Q/Q to 18.2M; Dynamics revenue grew 12% in constant currency.
More Personal Computing (Windows, search, games, hardware) revenue fell 17% Y/Y (13% exc. forex) to $9.4B due to PC weakness and declining phone sales (-54% in constant currency). Op. income fell 4% to $1.6B. With the Windows 10 launch providing a boost, Windows OEM revenue fell 6% Y/Y, an improvement from FQ4's 22%.

Financials: Lifting EPS: GAAP operating expenses fell 7% Y/Y to $7.3B (job cuts at work) after backing out year-ago one-time charges. Also helping: $4B was spent on buybacks.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will provide Yahoo (YHOO) with Web and image search services, as well as search ads via its AdSense for Search (AFS) platform (allows a custom Google-powered search engine to be provided). The deal covers both PCs and mobile devices, and will apply to Yahoo proprieties and affiliate sites in the U.S., Canada, and various Asian, African, and Latin American markets (but apparently not Europe, where regulators have been closely probing Google). (8-K filing)
Google will ""pay Yahoo a percentage of the gross revenues from AFS ads displayed on Yahoo Properties or Affiliate Sites,"" with the exact figure varying based on geography and platform. Yahoo will pay fees for Web and image search results. Yahoo ""has discretion to select which search queries to send to Google and is not obligated to send any minimum number of search queries.""
The deal, which could raise some eyebrows among regulators given Google's search dominance, follows an April restructuring of Yahoo's search pact with Microsoft/Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT) that made the alliance non-exclusive on both PCs and mobile. The revised deal still requires 51% of Yahoo's PC search traffic to carry Bing results and ads.

comScore estimates Yahoo had a 12.7% September PC search share in the U.S. (still by far the world's biggest ad market). Google's share is pegged at 63.8%, and Microsoft's at 20.6%. StatCounter estimates Yahoo's U.S. mobile/tablet search share is at 6.8%, and Google's at 88.4%.
YHOO -0.6% after hours after disclosing the deal in tandem with a Q3 miss. GOOG is flat. There was already speculation a deal could happen, given Yahoo has been testing Google-powered results.

Once again, both hardware and software declined, though hardware took the beating -- down 27% to $313.5M -- as many gamers may be awaiting a console price break or bundle in time for holiday shopping. Software sales fell just 3% by comparison, to $465.6M. Accessory sales rose again. In new games at retail, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (OTCPK:KNMCY) couldn't unseat either NBA 2K16 (NASDAQ:TTWO) or Madden NFL 16 (NASDAQ:EA), which finished September with a one-two punch, and settled at third place, just ahead of FIFA 16 (EA).

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.8% Y/Y in Q3 to nearly 71M units, a drop nearly as large as Q2's 11.8% and above a 9.2% projection. Gartner estimates shipments fell 7.7% to 73.7M.
IDC: ""Across many regions, the channel remained focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory before a more complete portfolio of models incorporating Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake processors comes on the scene ... Though easing a bit, currency devaluation continued to inhibit PC shipments in the third quarter. While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware.""
Nonetheless, IDC is ""optimistic"" about a demand pickup. ""While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware...""
Likewise, Gartner expects ""more stable market conditions"" in 2016. It's also pleased the U.S. notebook and ""premium ultramobile"" segments saw positive growth. Various analysts have reported seeing signs of stabilizing PC demand.
With tablet sales also under pressure, tablet cannibalization is less of an issue than before.

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ended a long-running patent spat involving about 20 suits in the U.S. and Germany. Financial terms are confidential.
Microsoft, which collects royalties from Samsung, HTC, and many other Android OEMs, had alleged Google's former Motorola Mobility unit (sold to Lenovo) infringed its IP. Google, which held onto most of Motorola's patents following the Lenovo deal, alleged Xbox consoles infringed its patents.
Much like Google/Motorola's settlement with Apple last year, the Microsoft deal comes with an agreement to cooperate on various patent issues. The tech giants plan to work on a royalty-free video codec meant to improve download/streaming speeds - Amazon and Netflix also back the effort - and lobby for a unified European patent system.
Separately, in a move that could partly be a response to ad-blockers, Google states its display ad network will now only charge advertisers for ads that are 100% viewable by by users. The company estimates 56% of display ads ""never had a chance to be viewed because they were below the fold, scrolled out of view, or in a background tab.""
Concerns about ad-blockers have grown following the recent launch of iOS 9, which supports blockers for Mobile Safari. JPMorgan has downplayed those concerns, arguing most ad-blocking takes place on desktops, that far more time is spent on mobile apps (largely immune to ad-blocking for now) than browsers, that publishers are starting to withhold content from those using ad-blockers, and that ad spend is shifting towards formats more immune to ad-blocking (e.g. native ads). The firm is concerned, however, about the fact ad-blockers prevent valuable tracking data from being collected.

""[A]fter several quarters of significant sell-offs, with the stock declining ~30% since its well-received Q4b 14 earnings report, reduced FYb 15 guidance ex-[Lynda.com], somewhat reset investor expectations, lessening headwinds to Marketing Solutions from secular shifts in advertising, as well as guidance and valuation more accurately incorporating slower growth, we are moving to the sidelines with our Hold rating,"" writes Brean's Sarah Hindlian. Her fair value estimate is $184.
Hindlian adds several of her concerns ""have largely played out,"" with the Sales Navigator social selling platform proving ""a disappointment"" and LinkedIn's (LNKD - unchanged) core Talent Solutions (jobs/recruiting) growth slowing on account of high penetration of ""price insensitive"" enterprises.

""Taiwan notebook ODM shipments increased 16% MoM in August, above our Citi Asia Hardware Analyst William Yang’s estimate of up 10% MoM and above the three year average of up 6% MoM,"" writes Citi's Chris Danely, arguing PC demand is improving after a very rough Q1 and Q2.
Danely adds Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has ""indicated PC demand appears to have bottomed, and PC OEMs have started to replenish inventory driven by the Skylake processor ramp,"" and that Micron (NASDAQ:MU) has ""stated DRAM spot prices have started to stabilize, which the company believes is a sign of a bottom in the PC market."" IT distributor Ingram Micro (NYSE:IM) is also said to be seeing stabilizing demand.
Wells Fargo's David Wong sings a similar tune. ""There have been signs of a seasonal pickup in PC builds. Month of August sales data reported by Taiwanese notebook and motherboard/computer makers shows a clear month-over-month lift in PC builds in August, and solid growth in the first two months of the September quarter compared to the first two months of the June quarter.""
Likely helping: Windows 10 (free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) launched in late July to decent reviews, and Intel has since gradually rolled out its 14nm Skylake CPU line. After starting off by launching the gamer/enthusiast-focused Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K desktop CPUs, Intel has rolled out the Skylake Y-series (meant for tablets and compute sticks), U-series (ultrabooks/convertibles), H-series (notebooks), and S-series (desktops). Sizable power/efficiency and GPU performance gains are generally promised relative to comparable 14nm Broadwell CPUs.

 Videogame sales slipped in August, despite the ""annual Madden,"" with new physical games and hardware down 2% to $548M, according to NPD Group. That's due to a bigger decline in software sales, though hardware slipped as well. Game sales fell 10% to $207.9M on tough comps against last year's Diablo III console launch and Sony's The Last of Us.
 Spending on hardware dropped a comparatively lighter 2% to $190.5M. Accessory sales rose, however, up 12% to $150M. Current-gen consoles rose to 68% of software sales from the prior month's 61%, according to Piper Jaffray. 
Madden NFL 16 (EA +0.3%) was the unsurprising leader in software for August after its late-month release, ahead of a pair of Microsoft (MSFT +0.4%) titles, Minecraft and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.
 “New physical software sales for [Xbox One and PS4] consoles, up 34%, did not offset the 51% decline in [last] generation console sales as well as the 24% drop in portable software sales,” said NPD analyst Liam Callahan.

A little under a month after the OS formally launched, 75M+ devices are running Windows 10 (MSFT +1.8%), VP Yusuf Mehdi discloses through a tweetsorm. On July 31, Mehdi stated Win. 10 downloads had topped 14M over the first 24 hours.
Also disclosed: Over 122 years of gameplay have been streamed from the Xbox One to Win. 10 systems, and the Windows Store has seen 6x as many downloads per Win. 10 device as it has for Win. 8 devices. The latter likely has a lot to do with the store's integration with the search bar found next to Win. 10's Start menu, and the ability to run Metro-style apps downloaded from the store on the traditional desktop UI.
Microsoft has generally seen positive reviews for Win. 10. However, with the OS provided as a free upgrade to Win. 7/8 users, expectations for its impact on PC sales have been subdued. IDC forecast today global PC shipments will drop 8.7% in 2015 to 281.6M - an 11.8% drop was estimated for Q2 - and decline further in 2016 before stabilizing in 2017.

For the second quarter in a row, LinkedIn (LNKD) fell hard post-earnings. Evercore and Avondale Partners downgraded to neutral ratings, while various other firms defended the company.
Evercore's Ken Sena notes LinkedIn's 2H15 sales (officially guided above consensus) were guided down if one excluded an accounting benefit related to the Lynda.com acquisition. ""The reasons for the company’s more conservative outlook have mostly to do with limited visibility on its Marketing Solutions line, where it continues to make a transition away from higher-priced premium display to feed-based and more performance-based ads.""
Though Sena thinks the ad transition can be managed, he declares ""the combination of another FY effective guide down, a steep deceleration in the company’s 2Q sequential user growth (measured on unique visitors), and margins showing compression (with and without Lynda) leads [Evercore] to move to the sidelines on shares."" He also compared LinkedIn's ad challenges to Twitter's.
BGC's Colin Gillis, on the other hand, considers ad concerns overblown in light of the strong performance of LinkedIn's Sponsored Updates ads. ""[D]isplay advertising is approximately 3% of overall revenue, and in our view its low quality revenue ... The irony is that the marketing solutions business that contains display advertising is the only business segment that accelerated its growth in the June quarter, growing at 32% YoY compared to 24% growth in the June 2014 quarter.""

Over 14M copies of Windows 10 were downloaded in the first 24 hours following its July 29 launch, Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%) exec Yusuf Mehdi discloses.
As announced months ago, the OS is a free upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 users ... including those with pirated copies. Microsoft has said pirated copies will continue to be labeled non-genuine/unsupported, but some have apparently been converted to genuine copies.
Reviewers generally declare Windows 10 a major improvement over the oft-criticized Windows 8, though some recommend users wait to upgrade until lingering bugs are fixed. The Verge's Tom Warren (8.8/10) likes the revamped Start menu, Cortana/search integration, and the Xbox app (allows Xbox One games to be streamed). ""Everything about Windows 10 feels like a new approach for Microsoft ... I rarely touch my MacBook Air anymore...""
Ars Technica's Peter Bright is a fan of Windows 10's notification center, Continuum feature (allows apps to have both touch and keyboard/mouse UIs), and support for touch-friendly Metro apps on the traditional Windows desktop. He calls the new Edge browser ""tremendously promising"" on account of its speed, stability, and streamlined UI, but adds it's ""severely feature-deficient"" for the time being.
Slate's Will Oremus: ""[Windows 10] is, as of today, the most versatile and forward-looking operating system in the world. That’s because it is the first to recognize and embrace the future of computing: a world in which all your devices are just different-sized screens running the same software ...

Millions of computer owners will be able to download Windows 10 for free after tomorrow, marking the first time Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has given away its latest Windows version without a fee.While many believe the push is to keep users on board, it may also highlight a shift in the overall strategy of Microsoft, which is looking to reverse a four-year slide in PC sales.The software giant seems to now be moving away from making money just once - when it sells a fresh version of Windows - to generating long-term revenue by selling apps, Web-search ads and other add-ons.

 Some of the biggest and best known U.S. businesses join the Obama administration in trying to build momentum for a deal at the climate change summit in Paris later this year. A dozen publicly traded companies - AA, AAPL, MSFT, BAC, BRK.B, KO, GM, GS, GOOG, PEP, UPS and WMT - committed to support a “strong"" outcome in  Paris, and made new pledges to take a variety of steps to tackle climate  change. For example, Alcoa says it will reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 50% by 2025, and BRK plans to retire 75% of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. In addition to company-specific goals, the White House says today's announcements total at least $140B in new low-carbon investment and more than 1,600 MW of new renewable energy.  ",2015-07-27

Hindlian, who launched coverage at Sell 6 weeks before LinkedIn plunged due to the guidance provided with its Q1 beat, also notes a 3% Q2 beat would still represent a 14% deceleration in growth from 2014 levels.

921,Barron's: Microsoft's cloud transition could lead to 50% gain in 3 years,"

Adobe's success in migrating its on-premise software base to cloud subscriptions - and the higher multiples afforded the company in response - could be a sign of things to come for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), argues Barron's in a bullish column that follows the software giant's FQ4 report and related selloff. Adobe, like Microsoft, was prodded to aggressively embrace cloud subscriptions by activist ValueAct Capital.

Barron's adds Microsoft has a 2.7% dividend yield and trades at less than 16x trailing free cash flow vs. an S&P 500 average of more than 20. ""A rise to $55 a share over the next year would leave Microsoft at 18 times trailing free cash flow, about where consumer staple heavyweight General Mills trades now."" Of note: A shift to cloud subscriptions leads near-term earnings to be depressed relative to free cash flow, since subscription revenue is recognized just a quarter at a time (unlike up-front license payments).
The paper also downplays concerns about weak Windows/PC sales, citing an RBC estimate that Windows now accounts for only ~10% of Microsoft's value. It gives a thumbs-up to Microsoft's Apple-like decision to make Windows 10 (due in 3 days) a free upgrade for Win. 7/8 PCs, and to deliver more frequent updates.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hasn't seen any upgrades/downgrades after beating FQ4 estimates, reporting strong cloud growth and major Windows/traditional Office declines, and once more providing conservative guidance. A handful of firms have tweaked their targets.
Bernstein's Mark Moerdler (Outperform), among Microsoft's defenders, notes the commercial cloud annual run rate ($8B) rose 27% Q/Q, and that cloud margins also improved. ""We estimate that the Gross Margin for each incremental dollar of revenue, given the current mix of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS is at a minimum~70%, if not greater, with long term SaaS margins of 86%+ and Azure margins equivalent to Amazon’s at similar scale.""
Credit Suisse's Philip Winslow (Outperform): ""We believe Microsoft can return to double-digit EPS growth by (1) continued rationalization of its cost structure, (2) further divestitures/exits of non-core businesses, (3) optimization of its capital structure, (4) stabilization in Windows pricing, and (5) an accelerated shift to Office 365 ...  Furthermore, we believe that Microsoft Azure will emerge as the clear #2 market share player in public IaaS [behind Amazon] and will arise as the leader in public PaaS.”
Cowen's Tim Arcuri notes Microsoft's Devices & Consumer licensing guidance (covers Windows OEM and traditional consumer Office licensing, as well as Android royalties) implies ~9.4% Q/Q growth, which in turn points to a healthy (Windows 10-driven) rebound in PC demand. D&C licensing was down 34% Y/Y in FQ4 to $1.7B, thanks to Windows/Office declines and the end of Nokia payments.
Raymond James' Michael Turtis (Market Perform) is worried about slumping commercial on-premise software sales. ""Commercial license $10,451 million (-7%) missed consensus $10,550 million (-6%), guidance $10.5-10.6 billion on both Office and Server weakness, with Server decelerating to 5% CC from F3Q’s +13% ... Commercial license billings declined 12% y/y, below revenue decline of -7%, though some of this could be transition to cloud ... We reduced our [FY16] estimates across product categories given the broader slow down and took down our Server product estimates given persistent forex impact and, possibly, the first signs of broader cannibalization of Server by Azure cloud.""

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its FQ4 CC for its various reporting segments to collectively see FQ1 revenue of $20.7B-$21.3B, below a $22.8B consensus. The company has been guiding cautiously for several quarters.
Forex is expected to have a 5% impact on FQ1 and FQ2 sales growth. Microsoft promises ""Windows 10 momentum"" will provide a lift during the second half of FY16 (ends June '16), and that Bing (responsible for major losses in past years) will turn profitable during the year. In the wake of the company's latest job cut announcement, FY16 operating expense guidance has been cut to $32.1B-$32.4B. The tax rate is expected to be at 24% (+/- 1%).
Ahead of the job cuts and the related narrowing of Microsoft's phone efforts, phone revenue fell 38% Y/Y to $1.23B (feature phone decline), with a negative gross margin. Lumia units rose 10% to 8.4M, but Lumia revenue fell due to a lower ASP.
Also: 1) Though revenue fell 5% Y/Y, the unearned revenue balance rose 1% Y/Y to $25.3B, and the contracted but not billed balance rose by ~$500M to $24.5B. 2) Office 365 consumer subs rose by nearly 3M Q/Q to 15.2M; traditional Office consumer revenue fell 42%. 3) Xbox shipments rose 30% to 1.4M. 4) Azure revenue and compute usage rose by triple digits Y/Y, and enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers rose by nearly 90% to 17K+. 5) FQ4 capex totaled $1.7B.
Microsoft is down to $45.38 in AH trading, maintaining the losses seen after the FQ4 report was published.

""I'm not going to launch a phone a day. I'm going to focus on a few phones that actually grab share that, in fact, showcase our uniqueness,"" says Satya Nadella (MSFT +0.4%) in a ZDNet interview a week after announcing huge job cuts for what was once Nokia's phone unit. ""If anything, the thing that I'm signaling most to the investors, to the employees is let's stop this thing about trying to atomically dissect any one [product line].""
Nadella talks up Microsoft's Continuum software - it changes the UI of a Windows device based on whether a user is relying on a keyboard/mouse, fingers, or stylus - as a differentiator. But he adds Microsoft's goal is now to ""be present on every mobile endpoint,"" regardless of platform. ""It's not (just) the notion of having our application endpoints ... on every one of the two billion devices. We want to have Microsoft experiences, because to me that's a platform play.""
The HoloLens augmented reality headset is declared to be part of both Microsoft's mobile and enterprise strategies. ""When the person was using Autodesk and Maya on the desktop and just moved to a 3D model and interacted, they weren't using their phone."" Nadella also suggests Microsoft will allow 3rd-party OEMs to create headsets based on the Windows Holographic platform.
Regarding Minecraft: ""We bought Minecraft for many reasons: because it's the number one PC app; it's the number one console app; it's the number one paid mobile app on iOS and Android. I wanted a hit game even for the new medium of mixed reality.""
On the GigJam productivity service/collaboration workspace, which has received positive initial reactions: ""Think of it as a new module of Office 365 ... It's not just a creation tool. It's not just a communications tool. It's not just a development tool ... The notion is to be able to generate applications on the fly to adjust to the work that you're doing versus sending you off to five different apps, five different devices, and five different communications sessions ...

IDC estimates global PC shipments tumbled to 66.1M in Q2, falling at a sharper Y/Y clip than Q1's 6.7% and about 1% faster than expected. Gartner is slightly less harsh, estimating shipments fell 9.5% to 68.4M.
Factors blamed for the decline: Inventory reductions ahead of the Windows 10 launch (set for July 29), a strong dollar (has led to higher overseas prices), and tough Y/Y comps caused by the 2014 boost in business PC sales caused by the end of Windows XP support. With tablet sales under pressure as well, tablet cannibalization is less of a factor than before ... but rising smartphone/tablet usage still appears to be taking a toll on PC upgrade rates.
Gartner sees full-year shipments falling 4.4%. IDC still expects low-to-mid single-digit declines in 2H15, before volumes stabilize in future years. It sees the Windows 10 launch going ""relatively well,"" but cautions Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to provide free upgrades to Windows 7/8 users will limit its impact on PC sales.
Continuing a recent trend, market leaders grabbed share from smaller rivals. IDC estimates #1 Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose to 20.3% from 19.4% a year ago, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) to 18.5% from 18.2%, and #3 Dell's to 14.5% from 14%. Acer (OTC:ASIYF) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) are respectively given 6.6% and 6.5% shares
Curiously, IDC has Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranked #4 globally, with its share rising to 7.8% from 5.9% via 5.1M Mac shipments (could imply a 15%+ revenue share), but Gartner doesn't have the company in its top-5. IDC and Gartner respectively assign Apple 13.5% and 12.7% U.S. shares. In the past, IDC's Mac shipment estimates have been notably different from the quarterly figures Apple would later report.
Near-term expectations for PC sales are already quite low, following Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q1 warning, AMD's Q2 warning, Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) June 25 results/guidance, and plenty of other negative news. Intel's Q2 report arrives on July 15.

LinkedIn (LNKD) has filed to allow shareholders in recently-acquired Lynda.com to sell up to 3.57M shares (slightly over 3% of outstanding shares) at their discretion.
Potential sellers include a family trust controlled by Lynda.com co-founders Lynda Weinman and Bruce Heavin, and investors Accel Partners, TPG, Meritech Capital, and Spectrum.
In April, LinkedIn struck a $1.5B deal to buy Lynda.com - 52% of the payout is in cash, and 48% in stock. Sell-side reactions to LinkedIn's purchase of the online learning platform have been largely positive, but the deal hasn't been without its growing pains.

""We will need to innovate in new areas, execute against our plans, make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value,"" says Satya Nadella (NASDAQ:MSFT) towards the end of an employee memo providing a new mission statement.
Nadella: ""We will realize our mission and strategy by investing in three interconnected and bold ambitions.1. Reinvent productivity and business processes2. Build the intelligent cloud platform3. Create more personal computing""
Worth remembering: The last time Nadella hinted at big changes in a memo (July 2014), Microsoft announced major layoffs a week later. The latest missive comes a week after Microsoft announced a reorg that (among other things) creates a new Windows and Devices group responsible for both OS and hardware development.

Less than 2 years after Steve Ballmer launched a big reorg (I, II), Satya Nadella (MSFT -0.2%) has announced a shakeup of his own. The biggest change: OS chief Terry Myerson will be in charge of a new Windows and Devices Group that covers both Windows and hardware (Xbox, Surface, Lumia, HoloLens, etc.) development. Hardware chief/ex-Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is leaving.
Also: 1) Cloud/enterprise product chief Scott Guthrie (in charge of Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio) will now also be in charge of Microsoft's Dynamics ERP/CRM business apps. 2) Apps/services chief Qi Liu (in charge of Office, Bing, Skype, Exchange, and SharePoint) will also be responsible for education market solutions.
Joining Elop out the door are Dynamics chief Kirill Tatarinov, advanced strategy EVP Eric Rudder, and chief insight officer Mark Penn (leaving to form an ad tech investment firm).
Nadella declares the moves leave Microsoft with 3 engineering groups that ""work together to deliver on our strategy and ambitions."" Ballmer's reorg also aimed to improve cross-product collaboration and remove internal fiefdoms/turf battles.
The Nadella era has already seen ex-Skype chief Tony Bates and marketing EVP Tami Reller leave. Meanwhile, former Office chief Kurt DelBene (left during Ballmer's reorg) has returned to be Microsoft's EVP of corporate strategy/planning.
Microsoft has also, of course, carried out massive layoffs during Nadella's time, with a big chunk of them hitting the former Nokia phone unit now under Myerson's purview. The company has hinted it could take a major write-down on the Nokia unit, which for now remains officially valued by Microsoft at $5.46B.

Update: Phone unit chief Jo Harlow (reported to Elop) is also leaving the company.

Going forward, Box (BOX +3.6%) clients will be able to ""browse, open and edit Office Online files directly from Box, as well as automatically save all changes made in Office Online back to Box in real-time."" By doing so, they'll be able to leverage Box's collaboration tools and security/compliance features while working on Office files.
Box has already worked with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to allow files stored via Box to be opened via Microsoft's PC and mobile Office apps, and to be saved back to the cloud once a user is finished. The integration work comes in spite of the fact Box competes with Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration platform and OneDrive cloud storage platform; unlimited OneDrive storage is provided to Office 365 subs.
Microsoft also has an Office integration deal with Dropbox. “We are company agnostic when it comes to who we integrate with,” says Microsoft exec Jared Spataro.
Box has caught a bid on the news. Shares jumped last week in response to Box's FQ1 beat and FQ2/FY16 guidance, but soon gave back their gains.

Microsoft also promises ""gamers won't have to pay to play games they already own."" That's a not-so-subtle shot at Sony (SNE +0.8%), which is charging users to play PS2/PS3 games on the PS4 via its PlayStation Now cloud game-streaming service.
Separately, the software giant says it's building a version of Minecraft specifically for its HoloLens augmented reality headset. The Verge: ""You can play with a controller as you'd expect, and create or explore worlds using holograms you create with voice or gestures ...

The alliance indicates Microsoft will rely on Oculus (widely seen as having an early VR tech lead) to counter the 1H16 launch of Sony's Morpheus VR gaming headset. Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality headset (due later this year) will also support Xbox gaming.
The first commercial edition of the Rift has been officially unveiled. It features two OLED screens (one for each eye), an integrated/removable headphone, and a tabletop camera to track head movements.
For the time being, the Rift will require a PC to work. No word yet on pricing; Oculus has previously suggested it would like to charge $200-$400. CEO Brendan Iribe has estimated the total cost of a Rift + a PC powerful enough to run it would be around $1,500. Meanwhile, Samsung has been working on the Gear VR, a less powerful Oculus-based headset that relies on a phone's display and camera.

960,Amazon stops using EU tax shelter; AWS tops Gartner's IaaS rankings,"

Bowing to regulatory pressure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has begun booking European revenue in the countries in which sales were recorded, rather than funneling it through the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The change, which could have a big long-term effect on Amazon's EU income tax payments, went into effect on May 1, and has thus far covered U.K., German, Italian, and Spanish sales.
Amazon already collects VAT on European sales, but its use of Luxembourg is one reason why its European income tax payments have been modest - the company paid just £4.2M in U.K. taxes in 2013 on revenue of £4.3B. The other reason, of course, is that Amazon's international ops (thanks partly to Asian investments) have been in the red - Amazon reported a $297M International segment op. loss for 2014, compared with a $2.11B North American op. profit.
Amazon's move could be a sign of things to come: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Starbucks, and a slew of other U.S. multinationals have also come under fire for their use of tax havens to cut their EU tax bills.
Separately, Gartner has given Amazon Web Services its highest rankings in its annual cloud infrastructure (IaaS) Magic Quadrant report in both the ""Ability to Execute"" and ""Completeness of Vision"" categories. Among the 15 IaaS providers reviewed, AWS and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure are the sole occupiers of Gartner's ""Leaders"" quadrant.
Gartner: ""[AWS] is the overwhelming market share leader, with over 10 times more cloud IaaS compute capacity in use than the aggregate total of the other 14 providers in this Magic Quadrant. This has enabled it to attract a very large technology partner ecosystem ... it is extraordinarily innovative, exceptionally agile, and very responsive to the market. It has the richest array of IaaS features and PaaS-like capabilities ... Although it is beginning to face more competition from Microsoft and Google, it retains a multiyear competitive advantage.""
Gartner does caution AWS ""can be a complex vendor to manage,"" and that it's ""spreading its efforts very broadly."" Altogether, it expects global IaaS spend to grow 32.8% this year to nearly $16.5B, and post a 29.1% CAGR from 2014-2019.

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) HoloLens augmented reality headset relies on an advanced optical projection system to ""generate multi-dimensional full-color images with very low-latency so you can see holographic objects in the physical world,"" the software giant states in a blog post released amid its BUILD conference.
HoloLens also supports spatial (location-specific) sound recognition. Other features related to capturing real-world data include a depth sensor used to ""spatially map your environment and interpret your hand gestures,"" head-tracking cameras, and an ""internal measurement unit"" (IMU) sporting an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
Processing power is provided not only by a CPU and GPU, but also by a Microsoft-designed holographic processing unit (HPU). There's still no word on HoloLens' exact launch date or pricing; a Microsoft exec told the NYT the device will cost ""significantly more"" than a console.
A slew of first-hand impressions have arrived from writers trying out HoloLens prototypes at BUILD. The consensus: HoloLens has tremendous potential, but its limited field of view for holograms is a major handicap for now.
""Within carefully managed conditions, HoloLens is one of the most amazing pieces of tech I've seen,"" writes The Verge's Adi Robertson. ""But HoloLens only feels natural when you're not handling anything much bigger than a basketball. It produces a magic square the size of a large TV screen, and the moment something slips outside, it disappears.""

Paul Thurrott, who tried out a bulkier demo unit in January, is a big fan of HoloLens' spatial sound support. But he adds the newer hardware prevents users from seeing holographic objects that aren't ""right in the middle of your field of vision."" Microsoft is relying on a feature called Gaze Control to keep a user's field of vision focused on holograms. Gesture and voice controls allow users to manipulate objects.

Business Insider's Julie Bort and Matt Weinberger provided one of the more positive takes. ""HoloLens is about getting specific tasks done ... Air-tapping to select and open holograms in the air felt surprisingly natural, as did talking into the microphone. Using it in conjunction with a standard mouse/PC setup felt very natural ... The HoloLens, or something like it, is the future."" They also observe Minecraft can function as a ""hologram-creation engine"" for HoloLens.

Not surprisingly, LinkedIn (LNKD -20.5%) has received plenty of target cuts in response to the soft guidance (blamed on a variety of factors) provided with its slight Q1 beat. But no downgrades have arrived, and many on the sell-side are defending the professional social networking leader.
Canaccord's Michael Graham: ""Most factors impacting revenue appear temporary (FX, marketing solutions product transition, Talent Solutions sales force shuffle, lynda.com), while a display [ad] revenue headwind seems more secular ... We are encouraged by rapid growth in Sales Solutions, and believe any material weakness in the stock will likely provide a good long-term entry point.""
Wunderlich's Blake Harper: ""The company saw its display ad business, especially in Europe, decline due to a shift to programmatic buying, but we remain bullish on the company’s potential to become a differentiated B2B content marketing platform ... Key metrics such as number of members, mobile visitors, and corporate talent solution customers were all in line with expectations...""
Morgan Stanley estimates only 25% of LinkedIn's 2015 EBITDA guidance cut is due to fundamentals. Goldman thinks management is once more being conservative with guidance.
Brean's Sarah Hindlian, whose decision to launch coverage at Sell in March is looking smart right now: ""Premium Subscriptions/Sales Navigator missed by 3% [in Q1] while management talked down Sales Navigator ramp on the call and was mum on new customer signings ... we think the company is scrambling to buy growth and the [salesforce] re-org is due to product fatigue.""
Eric Jackson observes an industry shift towards programmatic (automated) ad buys has hurt not only LinkedIn's ad sales, but also Yahoo and Yelp's. He thinks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been able to weather the storm thanks to its huge audience and targeting ability. ""Facebook offers much more reach to advertisers. They're still willing to spend money elsewhere, but they won't pay up for it. If there are cheaper options available to them when they use programmatic, there's no reason for them not to use them."" LinkedIn's unmatched professional data and favorable demographics could give it some room to differentiate in this landscape.

971,EU to widen probe against U.S. tech companies,"

Just two weeks after launching its landmark competition case against Google,  the European Commission is poised to widen its front against U.S. tech companies by initiating a separate investigation into a broader range of online platforms.
The latest draft of the plan, seen by the FT, will encompass everything from online shopping to telecoms regulation and is set be approved by the commission next week.
The ""digital single market"" probe could also bring in stricter rules to video services companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and messaging apps like WhatsApp (NASDAQ:FB) and Skype (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have become big rivals to traditional European media and telecoms companies.

In its Q1 CC prepared remarks (.pdf), LinkedIn (LNKD) states its 2015 Market Solutions (ad) revenue will be hurt by ""the continued migration to selling our new suite of products as well as more pronounced secular headwinds for traditional display-advertising."" Twitter can sympathize.
In addition, Talent Solutions (jobs) revenue saw ""larger than normal Q1 [sales] account transitions"" that increased churn and pushed out customer spending later into 2015, and will result in lower 2015 ratable revenue. The Marketing/Talent Solutions issues are expected to have a $30M 2015 revenue impact.
Meanwhile, Lynda.com (about to be acquired) is expected to contribute $20M-$25M in 2015 revenue ($3M in Q2). However, LinkedIn expects a $15M impact (split between Lynda and Talent Solutions) from piloting different approaches to cross-selling products.
As is the case for many peers, forex is also a big headwind: It's expected to have a $50M 2015 impact ($13M in Q2).
Also: Heavy spending is impacting LinkedIn's bottom line: The company ""significantly exceeded"" its Q1 goals for engineering/operations hires, and also continues to rapidly grow its salesforce. GAAP costs/expenses rose 38% Y/Y to $655M.
Talent Solutions revenue (62% of total revenue) rose 36% Y/Y in Q1; Marketing Solutions (19% of total) rose 38%, and premium subscriptions (19% of total) rose 28%. 39% of revenue was international. Talent Solutions accounts rose 35% Y/Y to nearly 35K.

974,Report: Oracle didn't make a bid for Salesforce,"

Following an afternoon Bloomberg report stating Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been approached by a potential acquirer, many have speculated archrival Oracle is the suitor. However, BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski (formerly with Re/code) reports Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) hasn't made such a move.
Outside of Oracle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the name that has popped up most often. The software giant (closed today with a $399B market cap) is large enough to swallow Salesforce, has relatively limited product overlap - its Dynamics CRM apps compete against Salesforce's apps, but generally with SMBs than enterprises - and has been hungry to grow its cloud exposure. It just set a target of nearly tripling its business cloud service revenue run rate by mid-2018.
Also: Microsoft and Salesforce struck an Office 365-centered partnership last year. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff showed up today at Microsoft's BUILD developer conference to trumpet the integration of additional Microsoft and Salesforce apps/services, and made a few tweets about the partnership along the way.
Salesforce closed up 11.6% today thanks to Bloomberg's report, and then rose 1% in AH trading to $75.41. Many cloud software peers also got a lift.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is aiming for a $20B/year run rate for its Commercial Cloud reporting segment by FY18 (ends June '18), says Satya Nadella at an analyst meeting (webcast) held amid the company's BUILD conference. Microsoft announced last week Commercial Cloud, a term that covers Azure cloud infrastructure/app platform services, commercial Office 365 sales, and Dynamics Online business app sales, was on a $6.3B/year run rate.
Assuming the target is hit, some of that growth will come from the migration of traditional Office and Dynamics licensees to cloud subscriptions. But Nadella promises there will be plenty of other growth as well. ""This is not a one-for-one shift. There is actually a pretty significant expansion of the value we can deliver.”
M&A, of course, could also expand the division. Bloomberg reported earlier today cloud CRM software giant Salesforce (current market cap of $47B) was approached by a potential acquirer. Much of the speculation about the rumored suitor revolves around Microsoft and Oracle.
Also: With Windows users now getting free upgrades and Microsoft increasingly looking to monetize the OS via services, the company says it will recognize Windows 10 license revenue over a 3-year period. Windows license revenue has traditionally been recognized up-front.

Furthering its efforts to win over iOS/Android developers (many of whom have been historically wary of the company), Microsoft (MSFT -0.4%) has used the first day of its 2015 BUILD developer conference to launch Islandwood and Astoria, projects that respectively allow iOS apps to be ported to Windows 10 and Android apps to run within Windows unmodified.
The efforts follow the December acquisition of HockeyApp (a provider of iOS/Android app crash analytics tools), and a promise that the next version of its core Visual Studio developer suite (Visual Studio 2015) would be ""built from the ground up with support for iOS, Android and Windows.""
Also launching: 1) Visual Studio Code, a free cross-platform code editor for writing Web/cloud apps. Microsoft has already made Visual Studio 2013 free to non-enterprise users in an attempt to win new developers. 2) Tools for presenting sites as apps, and for quickly modifying Windows apps so that they can be offered through the Windows Store.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has continued its barrage of Azure cloud service launches; its newest services are aimed at big data/analytics projects. One new service in preview mode (Azure SQL Data Warehouse) covers the building of structured data repositories, and the other (Azure Data Lake) unstructured repositories (prior analytics launches).
Microsoft states it's selling over 90K new Azure subscriptions per month, and that over 40% of its Azure revenue comes from startups and independent software firms. Synergy Research estimates Azure's revenue rose 96% Y/Y in Q1, and that its IaaS/PaaS share is around 10% (#2 behind Amazon's 29%).
Others news: 1) Microsoft has named its anticipated Spartan browser (ships with Windows 10) Edge. 2) The company predicts Windows 10 will be installed on 1B devices (inc. smartphones/tablets and the Xbox One) in 2-3 years. 3) Windows Holographic, Microsoft's platform for building HoloLens headset apps, has officially launched.

""By calendar 2016, we believe organic [constant currency] growth returns to low single digits with growing cloud business and earnings growth can potentially be restored to 10% or so with the leverage of share repurchase, and continued strong cash flow generation,"" writes Nomura's Rick Sherlund, upgrading Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Buy following its FQ3 beat. His target remains at $50.
Sherlund, who downgraded in January on account of Microsoft's FQ2 numbers, still thinks the company will be in a transition period for a few quarters, and notes certain core businesses (e.g. Windows, traditional Office licenses) were soft. However, he thinks total Office revenue (traditional + 365) could start rising again in 2016 ""given high interest and migrations among business users to Office 365 and new cross platform productivity tools for Windows, iOS and Android.""
""In our view, Microsoft is well ahead of its large cap value peer group in the transition to the cloud,"" says UBS' Brent Thill (Buy, $50 target). Pac Crest's Brendan Barnicle (Outperform, $50 target) observes Office 365 still covers less than 10% of the Office installed base, leaving plenty of room for growth. He estimates Azure is on a $1.5B/year revenue rate (compares with $5.16B in trailing revenue for AWS and a $6.3B/year run rate for Microsoft's broader commercial cloud ops).
On the CC (transcript), CFO Amy Hood stated Microsoft's FY15 (ends in June) opex guidance ($32.4B-$32.5B) is now $2B lower than where it initially was.

Continuing its habit of guiding cautiously, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has guided (.ppt) on its FQ3 CC for its various business units to have FQ4 revenue of $21.6B-$22.3B, below a $22.7B consensus. Corporate/other revenue (-$20M in FQ3, $314M in FQ2) isn't included in the forecast.
Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on FQ4 revenue growth, up from 3% in FQ3. The unearned revenue balance ($20.2B at the end of FQ3, +4% Y/Y) is expected to rise Q/Q, in-line with seasonality save for forex.
In its earnings slides (.ppt), Microsoft notes Office consumer revenue fell 41% Y/Y. 27% of the decline is attributed to the transition to Office 365 subscriptions from up-front licenses, and the rest to weak Japanese sales (they were strong a year ago ahead of a tax hike). ""Windows Phone"" revenue (includes Android royalties) fell 19% thanks to a mix shift towards low-royalty phones.
Xbox platform revenue fell 24% due to lower Xbox One sales and a mix shift towards cheaper models. Lumia phone sales (8.6M) were up 18% Y/Y; 24.7M non-Lumia phones were sold (down Y/Y).
Premium versions of Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server were a strong point: Their collective sales rose 25% ahead of the July end of Windows Server 2003 support.

A 12% increase in server product/services revenue (improved from FQ2's 9%) contributed, as did a 106% increase in commercial cloud revenue (nearly even with FQ2's 114%).
As expected, Windows OEM license revenue (hurt by both weak PC sales and discounts for smaller/cheaper devices) was soft: OEM Pro revenue fell 19% and non-Pro revenue 26%.

To date, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has only said Windows 10 (currently in the technical preview stage) will launch at some point this summer. AMD is among the Microsoft partners likely to be given advance notice about the software giant's launch plans.
A late-July launch would make the OS available in time for the back-to-school season, and would be well-received by a PC industry that just had a very rough Q1 caused in large part by soft enterprise and desktop demand. Windows 10 contains a bevy of enterprise-friendly features meant to win over businesses that shunned Windows 8. It will also be available as a free upgrade for users of both legitimate and pirated Windows copies, though the latter will still be viewed as unlicensed.
Separately, Microsoft has launched Azure Service Fabric, a framework that helps developers scale and customize Azure-based services more easily. The solution relies on breaking complex apps into ""microservices"" that can be jointly managed and automated, and programmed via Visual Studio. It follows the March launch of Azure App Service, a cross-platform Web/mobile app development service.

Following months of talks, Yahoo (YHOO +0.2%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.4%) have restructured their search alliance (struck in 2009, lasts until 2020). Notably, Yahoo will ""now have increased flexibility to enhance the search experience on any platform, since the partnership is non-exclusive for both desktop and mobile.""
The companies previously disclosed the alliance was non-exclusive on mobile, but hadn't announced anything similar for PCs. They now only state Yahoo ""will continue to serve Bing ads and search results for a majority of its desktop search traffic.""
At the same time, Microsoft will now ""become the exclusive salesforce for ads delivered by Microsoft's Bing Ads platform."" Yahoo will continue exclusively providing the salesforce for its Gemini mobile search/native ad platform.
""Satya [Nadella] and I have worked closely together to establish a revised search agreement that allows us to enhance our user experience and innovate more in our search business,"" says Marissa Mayer, who has previously voiced disappointment about the performance of the Microsoft deal.
The deal has required Microsoft to make revenue per search (RPS) guarantees equal to a % of Google's estimated RPS. Thanks to RPS payment changes, Yahoo's search revenue (ex-TAC) was flat Y/Y in Q4, even though its search click-based revenue (excludes RPS payments) was up 18%.
The restructuring follows a deal by Yahoo to displace Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider, and comes amid reports Yahoo/Microsoft are trying to sell Apple on replacing Google as Safari's default provider (including on iOS). comScore estimates Bing had a 20.1% March U.S. PC search share, and Yahoo a 12.7% share; international shares are lower.

Microsoft has bought the startup for an undisclosed sum; the company declares the deal furthers its efforts to offer ""easy-to-use, accessible tools to extract maximum value from data – from anywhere, on any device.""

Following an NYT column featuring remarks from exec Bill Hilf that that were taken to suggest HP (NYSE:HPQ) is exiting the public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, HP has told CRN it remains committed to the space. However, the IT giant adds (echoing Hilf's remarks) it's ""not competing head-to-head with the big public cloud players,"" such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
HP's comments follow the February departure of top cloud exec Marten Mickos (joined via the Eucalyptus acquisition), and the splitting of his responsibilities between Hilf and two other execs. The company entered the public cloud market in 2012, and (like many other enterprise IT firms) has been a backer of the OpenStack IaaS platform (pitched as an open-source alternative to Amazon/Google/Microsoft's proprietary offerings). HP asserts it has the largest OpenStack public cloud in existence.
HP's stance arguably highlights the challenges traditional enterprise IT names face in countering the cost and scale advantages possessed by IaaS market leaders, who have often eschewed the hardware of IT giants in favor of cheap white-label hardware produced by Asian contract manufacturers. HP has partnered with Taiwan's Foxconnn and Accton to offer white-box gear for cloud providers.
Synergy Research estimates the broader ""cloud infrastructure service"" market (covers IaaS and PaaS, as well as private and hybrid clouds) grew 48% in 2014 to $16B, as more on-premise workloads get migrated to cloud environments and various cloud service providers relying on IaaS/PaaS infrastructures see rapid growth.

Pitched as a cheaper alternative to the Surface Pro 3 (starts at $799, launched last May), Microsoft's (MSFT -0.6%) Surface 3 tablet starts at $499 and eschews the Pro 3's Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs in favor of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) less powerful/recently-launched Atom x7 (Cherry Trail). Its display is smaller (10.8"" vs. 12""), and resolution slightly lower (1920x1280 vs. 2160x1440). In what might be the final nail in the coffin for Windows RT, the tablet runs on Windows 8.1 (free upgrade to Windows 10 later this year).
The Surface 3 weighs just 1.37 lbs. and is only 0.34"" thick (the Pro 3 is at 1.76 lbs. and 0.37""), and goes without its costlier sibling's fan. The rear and front cameras respectively have 8MP and 3.5MP resolutions vs. 5MP apiece for the Pro 3. Other features - a kickstand, optional type cover accessories, a business-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio, stereo speakers with Dolby (DLB -0.2%) audio support - are similar.
Microsoft claims 10 hours of battery life when playing video. The Surface 3 begins shipping on May 5 (pre-orders start today); Verizon and T-Mobile will sell 4G-capable models later this year. To win over consumers, Microsoft is throwing in a free year of Office 365 Personal (normally $70/year).
Following a rough start in 2012/2013, the Surface line has gained a following among businesses and consumers wanting a tablet that can double as a PC/productivity device. Microsoft's Surface revenue rose 24% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $1.1B. IDC estimates Windows devices had a 5.1% 2014 tablet unit share via 11.6M shipments.

Three weeks after announcing Skype, OneDrive, and OneNote apps will be bundled with Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge (along with 115GB of OneDrive cloud storage), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) states its Android Office apps (along with OneDrive, OneNote, and Skype) will be pre-installed on ""select"" Samsung Android tablets.
The software giant has also announced Office pre-install deals with Dell and 9 other Android OEMs. The list includes major contract manufacturer Pegatron, Germany's TrekStor, and several emerging markets-focused OEMs. Financial terms are undisclosed.
Also: Microsoft is partnering with Samsung to offer business versions of Office 365 that are bundled with Samsung's KNOX Android security platform. The deal comes a year after Microsoft entered the enterprise mobility management (EMM) software market with a suite that provides device/app management, identity/access control, and data protection services for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices.

Last fall, Microsoft enabled document editing on its free iOS and Android apps - it was previously available only to Office 365 subs. In January, the company disclosed it has seen 80M+ downloads for its Office iPhone/iPad apps. The Google Apps productivity suite is free for Android and iOS users, while Apple's iWork suite is free to buyers of new iOS/Mac OS hardware.

994,Microsoft launches $70 Lumia 430,"

The 3G-only Lumia 430 is Microsoft's (MSFT +1.4%) cheapest Windows Phone to date. It has a 4"" 800x480 display and 8GB of storage, runs on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) low-end Snapdragon 200 processor (dual-core, 1.2GHz.), and contains a 2MP rear camera to go with a VGA front camera.
The 430, which goes on sale in April, also supports dual SIMs (important for emerging markets) and comes with up to 30GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its unveiling arrives three weeks after Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 640 and 640XL, and four months after it launched the low-end Lumia 535 (5"" display and 3G-only, starts at €110).
Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4. While costlier Lumias have struggled to gain ground against the iPhone and high-end Android hardware (thanks in part to iOS/Android's app support edge), cheaper models have fared well in many cost-sensitive emerging markets. The 430 aims to significantly lower the cost edge the cheapest Android devices still have.
IDC estimates Windows Phone had a 2.8% global smartphone unit share in Q4 vs. 76.6% for Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) and 19.7% for the iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Polycom (PLCM +1.7%) plans to offer a line of videoconferencing products built specifically for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) widely-used Skype for Business (until recently known as Lync) unified communications (UC) software platform.
The first product created for the offering, the RoundTable 100, is aimed at SMBs; Polycom claims it takes ""just minutes to set up and start using. In addition, Polycom's CX videoconferencing hardware line will join the RoundTable line, and its VVX business phones will support an upcoming Office 365 cloud VoIP service.
Synergy Research just estimated Microsoft had a 13% Q4 UC collaboration market share, second only to (Polycom archrival) Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) 16%. Polycom was assigned a 3% share (#5 overall). Overall, the market grew only 2% Y/Y, with declining enterprise voice and telepresence product sales offset by growing demand for hosted voice, hosted contact center, cloud UC, enterprise social networking, and enterprise presence/IM offerings.

996,Windows 10 arriving in summer; pirates getting free upgrades,"

Windows 10 (MSFT +0.1%) ""will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages,"" OS chief Terry Myerson writes in a blog post. COO Kevin Turner previously said Windows 10 would be available in in late summer or early fall.
Meanwhile, during a talk with Reuters, Myerson stated Microsoft will be ""upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine, to Windows 10."" He asserts Microsoft's goal with the initiative is to ""re-engage"" with Chinese Windows users, a huge percentage of whom have pirated copies.
To further its Chinese Windows reach, Microsoft has struck distribution deals with Lenovo, Tencent, and Qihoo; Lenovo will offer Windows 10 ""upgrade services"" at 2,500 service centers and retail stores, while Tencent and Qihoo will provide the OS to the hundreds of millions of users of their Web services.

In January, Microsoft promised Windows 10, which contains many features meant to win over enterprises that shunned Windows 8, would be a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8.1 users. The company has suggested it will rely more on services to monetize Windows (already free or discounted for smaller/cheaper hardware) going forward.
Microsoft is coming off a December quarter in which its Windows OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue both fell 13% Y/Y, thanks largely to discounts and slowing business PC sales. Intel's Q1 warning (blamed on business weakness and lower-than-expected customer inventories) suggests PC demand has remained soft thus far in 2015.
Also: Myerson says Microsoft is launching a free version of Windows 10 for small-footprint embedded/IoT devices. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is among the early supporters, launching a development kit that features its mid-range Snapdragon 410 processor.

Although being pushed into retirement, the Internet Explorer name will live on, and will be included in the next Windows launch for enterprise compatibility.

998,LinkedIn slides after Brean starts at Sell,"

As part of a broader Internet/cloud software stock coverage launch, Brean's Sarah Hindlian (formerly with Evercore and JPMorgan) has started LinkedIn (LNKD) with a Sell rating and $208 target.
Hindlian thinks expectations for LinkedIn's Sales Navigator social selling platform (now a large % of subscription revenue) are too high, and that the ""browsability"" of its core site is lacking. ""While we note that LinkedIn has a valuable asset — its database of global professionals and their respective networks - we fear attempts to monetize it could be more limited than investors may realize.""
She argues LinkedIn's aggressive efforts to boost engagement via its messaging platform (InMails), publishing platform, and other services are hurting the user experience, while failing to boost time spent on its site. ""In the long term we are concerned that investors are comfortable comparing a sales user base to a talent recruitment base, noting that any successful loading of sales people onto LinkedIn is likely to significantly disrupt users, and therefore disrupt Ad Revenues.""
Her target translates to a 9x 2015E EV/sales multiple.

LinkedIn (LNKD - unchanged) has acquired Careerify, a Toronto-based developer of recruiting software tools for businesses. Terms are undisclosed.
Two of Careerify's products will be shuttered, but a referral product that helps companies find job candidates using their employees' social network contacts - it could complement LinkedIn's existing recruiting tools, which make heavy use of publicly-shared member data - will remain open to existing customers. No word yet on how LinkedIn exactly plans to leverage the product or its underlying technology.
Careerify CEO Harpaul Sambhi: ""We decided to join LinkedIn due to what we lacked – massive scale. More than 30,000 companies across the globe leverage LinkedIn for recruitment, and with more than 347 million members, LinkedIn offers an opportunity to make a much larger impact on job seeking and hiring.""
The purchase follows LinkedIn's 2014 acquisitions of business ad services firm Bizo (recently leverage to launch a new ad product) and job search engine/listing platform Bright.

1000,"Microsoft roundup: Azure, MSN, Cortana","

Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) has ""generated $1 billion in total worldwide revenue from Azure since 2011,"" BI's Julie Bort reports after talking with sources. Bloomberg reported in 2013 Microsoft had produced $1B in Azure-related revenue; however, that figure also included software purchases tied to deployments of the cloud infrastructure/app development (IaaS/PaaS) platform.
Bort adds over 3K companies have added Azure to their existing enterprise contracts, and that many of them ""are not using Azure at all, or have dabbled with it and then ignored it."" Salespeople have reportedly been pressured to boost Azure sales, and have ""sold Azure by discounting other software and adding the money saved on that software back into the contract as credits to try Azure.""
Microsoft hasn't broken out Azure revenue by itself; it's only reported as part of a Commercial Cloud segment that also includes commercial Office 365 and cloud Dynamics app sales.
BI's figure suggests Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has a sizable revenue lead over Azure. Amazon's ""Other"" revenue, which is dominated by AWS, totaled $5.6B in 2014 (+42% Y/Y). Synergy Research estimates Amazon had a 30% Q4 IaaS/PaaS revenue share on the back of 51% Y/Y growth, and Microsoft a 10% share (#2 overall) with 96% growth.

GeekWire reports (citing a memo from Satya Nadella) Microsoft is moving its MSN online services group from its apps/services division (run by Qi Lu) to its OS division (run by Terry Myerson). The shakeup could yield efforts to more tightly integrate MSN's services with Windows.

Reuters reports Microsoft is prepping a more advanced version of Cortana called Einstein that will ship with Windows 10, and also be available via standalone iOS and Android apps. Like Google Now, the new version of Cortana will read/analyze e-mail to push location and time-sensitive info to users.

In the latest sign of weakening demand for personal computers, International Data Corp. predicts global shipments of PCs will decline 4.9% this year to 293.1M units, a bigger drop than its previous guidance for a 3.3% decrease.

Gross margin guidance remains at 60% (+/- 2%), with lower volumes offset by higher ASPs. ""All other expectations"" have been withdrawn - that presumably includes full-year guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth. Guidance will be updated during Intel's April 14 Q1 report. The chip giant blames the warning on ""weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain."" In particular, it thinks ""lower than expected Windows XP* refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe,"" are taking a toll on sales.

 While HBO (NYSE:TWX) is in high-profile talks with Apple to launch its streaming HBO Now service on Apple TV, other providers will be joining in at some point or even at launch day yet, including Google and TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) among others. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be first to agree to the launch, Bloomberg notes, because its negotiation is simpler than that with HBO's longtime pay TV partners. Cox Communications and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) are also linked to discussions, though traditional cable/satellite providers are a tougher sell, accustomed as they are to the traditional arrangement (and income stream). It's safe to assume all the partners marketing HBO's current HBO Go offering are likely to engage in some level of talks with TWX to offer HBO Now -- including Roku, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Cable repercussions? Several pay TV operators had started lowering their price for HBO via promotions, a possible move to brace for HBO Now's direct launch: Comcast lowered its monthly HBO rate from $18.95 to $15, or $10 if you order online. Verizon's offering HBO for $9.99/month for first 12; Time Warner Cable is offering $9.99/month for online orders; Cox is offering $10/month for the first six. As for HBO Go -- the current service that allows mobile viewing for authenticated existing HBO customers -- it appears it will continue to exist as is for now, despite the likelihood of product confusion.

A day after slumping to new post-IPO lows and coming within $0.03 of $80, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has seen dip-buyers emerge in large numbers. Naturally, Yahoo (YHOO) is along for the ride.
The gains come as a Chinese publication reports Jack Ma once said he considered acquiring Yahoo, which plans to spin off its Alibaba stake into a publicly-traded company in Q4. Ma's alleged comments: ""The acquisition of Yahoo is something I worked [on] a couple of years ago, this is a political problem, not an economic problem, Yahoo is a media [company], more sensitive.""
There has already been speculation Alibaba will try to buy Yahoo's spinoff (much less politically challenging than buying the whole of Yahoo) at some point. Bloomberg's Matt Levine has noted the spinoff will have to wait a year before a deal occurs, in order to maintain its tax-free status.
Meanwhile, Alibaba's Aliyun cloud services unit (a giant in the Chinese cloud infrastructure market) has opened a Silicon Valley data center, its first in the U.S. For now, the data center will cater to Chinese companies with U.S. operations, but it plans to go after non-Chinese clients later this year.

Though more complex to run that standard public cloud solutions, hybrid clouds are ""likely to grow as a percentage of total cloud deployments in the next two to three years"" due to strong corporate interest, argues Pac Crest's Brendan Barnicle. He expects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has made an aggressive hybrid cloud push via Azure and its integrations with various on-premise Microsoft products, to benefit.
While Amazon and Google overwhelmingly focus on public cloud services, Barnicle observes many enterprises are more partial to a hybrid approach in which mission-critical apps and data are kept on-premise, while other workloads are moved to public clouds. He also points out hybrid clouds enable new backup, disaster recovery, and archiving services, among others.
In addition, Barnicle argues a server upgrade cycle resulting from Microsoft's ending of Windows Server 2003 support (set for July 14) will boost Azure demand. ""We believe many of these customers will be upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2, which would allow hybrid cloud deployments. Additionally, most of the SMB customers that need to upgrade are likely to transition to a public cloud solution such as Azure.""
Rackspace, IBM, and other backers of the OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform are also betting heavily on hybrid clouds. Meanwhile, Google struck a deal last month with VMware to make several Google public cloud services available on VMware's vCloud Air hybrid cloud platform.
Microsoft hasn't broken out Azure's revenue by itself. The company did recently announce its Commercial Cloud revenue (covers Azure, Office 365 for businesses, and other offerings) is now on a $5.5B/year run rate.

Down AH yesterday due to the light sales guidance provided with its mixed Q4 results, Rackspace (RAX +1.4%) is now back above $50. Helping its cause: Pac Crest has upgraded to Outperform, and at least four firms have hiked their targets.
Pac Crest cites enterprise and OpenStack momentum as reasons for upgrading: ""In the second half of 2014, Rackspace won more large enterprise contracts worth at least $100,000 per month than it had in the prior five quarters combined ... management indicated that OpenStack now makes up more than 50% of its public cloud revenue, which implies OpenStack revenue is at least 15.6% of its total revenue.""
Cowen (target hiked to $75) now considers it likely Rackspace ""will announce support for a mega cloud provider in 1H15,"" thereby boosting its long-term addressable market and lowering future capex needs (in exchange for sharing revenue). It adds sales guidance was in-line after adjusting for forex, and that EBITDA margin guidance was better than expected.
Meanwhile, new CEO Taylor Rhodes argues the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market's price war is calming down. ""Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) in November, for the first time, didn’t make a price cut move ... AWS is feeling like they are the reference brand leader, that they are strong versus Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), so they don’t need to do it as much.

 Six months after filing a contract dispute suit with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) over unpaid Android royalties, Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%) says it has settled the dispute. Terms are confidential.
Microsoft previously suggested Samsung stopped paying royalties in late 2013, with the electronics giant arguing the Nokia deal (by making Microsoft a phone manufacturer itself) nullifies the 2011 Microsoft/Samsung deal and requires a new cross-licensing agreement to be inked.
The bottom-line impact of a settlement could be big: Samsung paid $1B in royalties to Microsoft in 2013 (pure gross profit, or close to it), and Samsung, though losing ground in recent quarters, still maintained a 20% Q4 global smartphone share, per IDC.

Not surprisingly, Moody's has granted the debt an Aaa (Prime) rating. Also unsurprising are the low reported interest rates: 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year debt tranches are said to respectively carry interest rates just 55 bps, 95 bps, and 140-145 bps above comparable Treasurys.
Microsoft sold $8B in dollar and euro-denominated notes in late 2013. The company had $103B in cash/investments (much of it offshore) at the end of December, and $28B in debt.

Update (2:25PM): Bloomberg reports the offering has been upsized to $10.75B.

WorkMail, an Amazon (AMZN -0.1%) corporate e-mail/calendar solution launching in Q2, takes aim at a market dominated by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and in which Google (Gmail/Google Calendar) and IBM (Notes/Domino) are also prominent.
Amazon isn't primarily looking to replace Microsoft Outlook and other client-side e-mail apps, but rather server-side platforms such as Exchange. The e-commerce giant argues its solution will be easier to use/deploy than alternatives, and also offer better security on account of having all data encrypted with customer-managed keys.
This isn't the first time Amazon has layered a value-added business service on top of AWS: It has already launched Workspaces, a PC virtual desktop solution, and Zocalo, an enterprise cloud storage/document-sharing platform.
Pricing is aggressive, but not incredibly so: Amazon is charging $4/user/month for WorkMail on a standalone basis (50GB of storage), and $6/user/month if bundled with 200GB of Zocalo storage. Forbes' Ben Kepes is impressed with the offering, but also would like to see Amazon provide more storage and ""make a foray into broader office productivity functionality.""

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides (.ppt) for its reporting units to collectively have FQ3 revenue of $20.6B-$21.4B, below a $23.8B total revenue consensus. Corporate/other revenue, which totaled $314M in FQ2, isn't included in the guidance. Forex is expected to hurt revenue growth by ~4%.
Full-year operating expense guidance has been cut by $1B to $33.2B-$33.6B. Another $200M worth of restructuring charges are expected over the rest of FY15 (ends June '15), yielding total charges of $1.4B. FY15 tax rate guidance is at 22%-24%; the FQ2 tax rate was 25%.
In its earnings slides (.ppt), Microsoft states its unearned revenue balance was $21.2B at the end of FQ2, +9% Y/Y but slightly below historical seasonality due to forex and the recognition of $300M worth of prior period deferrals. The contracted but not billed balance was above $24B.

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Window OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue both fell 13% Y/Y in FQ2. The Pro slowdown is blamed on slowing business PC sales, academic discounts, and  ""mix returning to pre-Windows XP end of support levels."" The non-Pro decline is due to unit growth coming from cheaper hardware that Microsoft is providing discounted license fees for. Commercial Windows volume license revenue rose 3%.
Total Commercial revenue rose 5% Y/Y in FQ2 to $13.3B, helping drive the revenue beat. Devices & Consumer revenue (lifted by the Nokia deal) rose 8% to $12.9B. Commercial reporting segments accounted for over 2/3 of FQ2 gross profit  of $16.3B.

Segment performance: Commercial licensing revenue -2% Y/Y to $10.7B (hurt by the cloud shift). Commercial other +46% to $2.6B (boosted by cloud growth). Device/consumer licensing -25% to $4.2B (Windows and Android royalty declines). Computing/gaming hardware -11% to $4B (Xbox One launched a year ago). Phone hardware revenue was $2.3B, above guidance of $2B-$2.2B but down from FQ1's $2.6B (feature phone decline).

BOX closed up 65.4% from its $14 IPO price, leaving it with a $2.77B market cap (15% above the valuation for its last funding round). 41.4M shares changed hands, or 3.3x the 12.5M sold through its IPO (before factoring the overallotment option).
Co-founder/CEO Aaron Levie, best known to some for his Twitter one-liners, made the rounds today, arguing more than once his company's offerings are well-differentiated from the aggressively-priced cloud storage/file-sharing services of tech giants.
Levie during a talk with Barron's: ""What we’ve built really is software to help manage and collaborate and share throughout the business ... ultimately our customers buy our solution because we have built an amazing product to manage all that content. We get compared to more storage-oriented products, but there’s more to it.""
He called Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose SharePoint collaboration platform is widely deployed and which is now offering unlimited OneDrive storage to Office 365 subs, Box's biggest competitor, but also one Box can stand out relative to. ""I think our real differentiation is we do all the enterprise-oriented delivery, the industry compliance for FINRA, the security, and all that — but the really unique part is we deliver that in a consumer-grade experience, with open APIs, and that works across platforms.""
Levie suggests to Forbes Box will focus going forward on giving clients more tools for using/interpreting data, pointing to its recent acquisition of medical image-sharing platform MedXT as an example. He also notes Box is investing in industry-specific machine learning tools that analyze content to organize, surface, and recommend documents.

The device contains a see-through display that allows users to see holograms in their real-world environments, and doesn't require a connection to a PC or phone. Microsoft has christened the augmented reality platform underpinning it Windows Holographic.
HoloLens is expected to launch around the same time as Windows 10. LCoS microdisplay vendor Himax (HIMX +5.4%), previously rumored to be working with Microsoft, has spiked higher.
Also unveiled: Surface Hub, an 84"" 4K touch display sporting dual cameras and sensors, running Windows 10, and providing quick access to Skype video calls and a digital whiteboard. The product, which presumably won't be cheap, appears to be aimed at conference rooms.
As rumored,  Microsoft's Spartan browser sports a streamlined  UI, Cortana integration, a note-taking/annotating stylus mode, and a new rendering engine that delivers improved performance. It also has a Reading Mode that formats Web pages to resemble e-books.
A slew of new universal apps (they feature similar PC and phone/tablet UIs) have been shown off. OneDrive, a photos app, and a People app are among the covered products.

To drive home his claim, Myerson states Windows 10 will be provided as a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8.1 users during its first year of availability. As one would expect, Windows Phone users will also get a free upgrade for the OS, which aims to provide an integrated developer environment for PCs, phones, and tablets (albeit with different UIs).
More details have been given about Windows 10's revamped Start Menu: It can work in full-screen mode, and its tiles support live animations. Other new features shown off include an Action Center providing quick access to settings and notifications, new touch gestures, and Cortana integration.

While Facebook rolls out an enterprise social networking platform to test partners, LinkedIn (LNKD) says it's prepping its own tools for connecting and sharing with co-workers.
The products include a solution allowing users to send private messages (InMails) to co-workers even if they aren't connected, a product for sharing employee contact info, and an app for joining employee groups receiving specific content from an employer. However, unlike many existing business social networking solutions (as well as Facebook's), there won't be a chat service.

Facebook at Work, first reported on by the FT in November, has been made available via app stores to select enterprise test partners. The platform looks a lot like standard Facebook (FB +0.4%) - it contains a news feed, messaging tools, and groups - and lets users log in with their regular Facebook accounts. But a user's professional data is completely split off from his/her personal data, and Facebook won't collect any of it.
Moreover, unlike LinkedIn (LNKD +0.1%), Facebook at Work is only focused (for now) on connecting with co-workers, thus arguably making it more of a rival to Jive Software (JIVE -0.3%), Salesforce's Chatter platform, and Microsoft's Yammer. LinkedIn and Jive both sold off following the November FT report.
With no ads being sold, corporate subscriptions are a potential revenue stream. Facebook can count on its giant, highly engaged user base to drive interest in Work. At the same time, it has to contend with corporate wariness towards Facebook, historically viewed by many of them as a productivity-killer.
Separately, Oppenheimer and Credit Suisse have respectively hiked their Facebook targets to $100 and $102. Oppenheimer expects a strong Q4 report on Jan. 28. ""Checks suggest 4Q pricing +14% q/q and +21% y/y, with same-client spending +32% q/q and 33% y/y ... Organic reach is becoming more difficult, due to competition for newsfeed impressions ...

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 2.4% Y/Y in Q4 to 80.8M - a bigger decline than Q3 and Q2's 1.7%, but better than expectations for a 4.8% drop. Gartner is more positive, estimating shipments rose 1% to 83.7M.
Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win. XP support) has slowed, and that ""market progress has been fueled by low-priced systems, including growth of Chromebooks and [Microsoft's] promotion of Windows 8 + Bing.""
On the bright side, both IDC and Gartner report Asia-Pac returned to positive growth, and that broader consumer demand is gradually improving. The U.S. consumer market is expected to return to positive growth in 2015, aided by slowing tablet demand and the Windows 10 launch.
IDC believes all top-5 vendors gained share from rivals with less scale. A quarter after cracking the top-5 for the first time with a 6.3% share, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) unit share is believed to have risen to 7.1% (+130 bps Y/Y) on the back of 4.9M shipments (+18.9%). Given higher ASPs, revenue share might be around 15%.

Among Spartan's most noteworthy features: The integration of Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant to ""surface information on flights, hotel bookings, package tracking, and other data within the traditional address bar,"" based on a user's browsing activity. Also, Cortana search is said to replace ""every instance of the existing Bing methods in Internet Explorer.""

As it is, Facebook didn't offer the most direct approach to accessing Bing results - users typically had to click/tap on a ""See more results"" option, then choose from a list of suggested queries in a right-hand column box. ""We don't think a lot of people will come to Facebook to do web searches,"" Mark Zuckerberg once admitted. However, with Facebook handling over 1B queries of all kinds each day, it still acted as a valuable traffic source.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has rolled out a slew of new Azure cloud infrastructure and app platform services for the second time this fall (previous). Among the new offerings: 1) A high-performance (SSD-based) storage option for Azure virtual machines. 2) Performance and management improvements for the Azure SQL Database service. 3) An improved search service for 3rd-party apps.
In addition, previously-announced services such as RemoteApp (cloud Windows app hosting) and Azure Active Directory (cloud identity/access management) are now generally available.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has bought HockeyApp, a provider of services that analyze crash data and distribute beta releases of apps for iOS and Android developers. Terms are undisclosed.
Microsoft, hungry to win over mobile and Web/cloud developers who haven't historically embraced its products, plans to include HockeyApp's features in a new version of it Application Insights analytics service, which integrates with the company's mainstay Visual Studio app development suite.

Last month, Microsoft announced it would make Visual Studio free for non-enterprise users, and promised Visual Studio 2015 would be ""built from the ground up with support for iOS, Android and Windows."" Facebook, Twitter, and Google have also released a bevy of tools for mobile developers.
Separately, Microsoft has made its MSN consumer apps (formerly known as Bing apps) available on the iOS App Store, Google Play, and Amazon's Appstore for Android. News, sports, weather, finance, and health/fitness apps are among the released products; they were already available on Windows (through the Metro UI) and Windows Phone.

Sherlund, who also notes activist ValueAct Capital's presence on the board, sees Microsoft launching ""a more moderate, but still shareholder value enhancing, 5%-10% share repurchase"" on to top of existing efforts to buy back ~$8B/year worth of shares. He adds Microsoft could lower its share count by 8% if it raised $32B in debt for buybacks.
Microsoft's balance sheet would made larger buybacks easy to finance: The company had $89.2B in cash and short-term investments at the end of September, and $23.7B in debt. FY14 (ended June '14) free cash flow was $27.7B.
Aside from capital returns, Sherlund is bullish about Microsoft's ability to cut Xbox and Bing costs, and to keep rapidly growing Office 365 and Azure revenue. His target was only at $40 14 months ago.

The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) plans to offer higher commissions to top-performing Google Apps resellers, hoping to put a larger dent into Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) productivity software dominance. Right now, Google has only 10K+ Apps reseller partners; Microsoft has 400K+ for Office.
Gartner estimates Google accounted for less than 1% of the productivity market's revenue in 2013, compared with Microsoft's 90%+.  Corporate familiarity/comfort with Office, together with strong uptake  for Office 365 (features both cloud and local apps, unlike Google Apps),  have stood in Google's way.
Google has run about 6,000 studies for ad clients in recent months to see if brand ads leave their intended impression on viewers, says display/video ad VP Neil Mohan. The studies are part of an aggressive push by Google to compel marketers to move more of their brand ad spend online.
Related efforts include working with Nielsen and comScore to get a better read on who's seeing a particular ad, and ensuring ad impressions are actually viewed by a person (still a challenge). YouTube is set to be a major beneficiary of the shift in brand ad spend towards digital channels.
The U.K. plans to impose a 25% tax on profits locals produced by multinationals that are shifted to tax shelters. The press is already calling the levy a ""Google tax"" - it comes amid broader EU scrutiny of the use of tax shelters by multinationals.
Google has confirmed it's launching versions of popular products, including search, YouTube, and Chrome, meant specifically for kids 12 and younger (previous). Though parental controls will be included, concerns about running afoul of FTC privacy and children's advertising rules exist.

Apple, which naturally views Google as a major rival, already dropped Google as iOS and Mac OS' Spotlight search provider this year in favor of Bing. Yahoo, meanwhile, is less than a week removed from announcing it has displaced Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider; Google is still the default provider in Europe.
The Firefox deal suggests Google is willing to walk away from default search agreements if Yahoo/Microsoft (hungry to grow their scale) significantly undercut its revenue-sharing terms, betting much of its base will keep using Google regardless. Macquarie has estimated Google provides Apple with a 75% cut on Safari-driven iOS search ad revenue.
On iOS, users could keep relying on Google search in the event of a Yahoo deal by manually selecting Google as their Safari search option (should Yahoo become the default), or by using Google's popular search and Chrome apps.

The WSJ reports Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has reached a deal to buy Israeli cybersecurity/identity-protection software firm Aorato for ~$200M, and plans to announce it today. The paper reported in July a deal was close.
Aorato's products complement Microsoft's Active Directory enterprise authentication/ID-management software service, since they analyze Active Directory interactions to create user profiles and detect suspicious activity. There could also be synergies with the cloud-based Azure Active Directory service.
In its latest effort to grow its developer base (previous) and support rival platforms, Microsoft is open-sourcing the server stack for its.NET software framework (underpins many Windows apps), and allowing developers to write server/cloud-based .NET apps for Linux and Mac OS. The move could help .NET better compete against alternatives such as Ruby on Rails and PHP.
Microsoft has also: 1) Launched a free version of its mainstay Visual Studio 2013 app development suite for non-enterprise users. 2) Previewed Visual Studio 2015, which the company says is ""built from the ground up with support for iOS, Android and Windows.""
Microsoft says it will ""shortly"" reach 10M Xbox One sales, and that sales have tripled since a $50 price cut went into effect on Nov. 2. The latest figures still leaves the One's total sales behind the 13.5M seen by the PS4 as of the end of Q3.

Among them: Divesting underperforming/non-core businesses, increasing capital returns, and accelerating the Office 365 shift in a manner similar to Adobe's Creative Cloud migration. 365 commercial seats were up 96% Y/Y in FQ1.
Oppenheimer's Shaul Eyal (Outperform) likes the margin strength, as well as the 128% growth in total commercial cloud revenue. ""It appears CEO Nadella is infusing new DNA.""
Separately, Microsoft officially announced today it will now use its own brand for Lumia hardware rather than Nokia's. The Nokia brand will still be used for some feature phones, such as the Nokia 130.

1074,Microsoft low-balls guidance once more,"

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its FQ1 CC for FQ2 revenue of $25.4B-$26.5B, below a $27.9B consensus. But the company has shown quite the knack for guiding conservatively in recent quarters; FQ1 revenue ($23.2B) was soundly above the guidance provided in July ($21.2B-$22.3B).
The company notes Devices & Consumer Licensing revenue (-9% Y/Y in FQ1) is being affected by the loss of revenue from Nokia; Nokia revenue totaled $650M in FQ2 last year.
Total Windows OEM revenue fell 2% Y/Y in FQ1, as price cuts offset unit growth. ""Windows Phone revenue"" (driven by Android royalties) fell 46%, something attributed in part to a ""higher mix of low-royalty devices;"" Microsoft is in the midst of a royalty dispute with high-end Android leader Samsung.
9.3M Lumia phones were sold (up slightly Y/Y), aided by strong European and low-end demand. With feature phone sales falling quickly, phone hardware revenue is expected to drop to $2B-$2.2B in FQ2 from FQ1's better-than-expected $2.6B.
Search ad revenue rose 23% Y/Y; Microsoft pegs Bing's U.S. search share at 19.4% (+140 bps Y/Y).
Full-year opex guidance is unchanged at $34.2B-$34.6B. Due to the Nokia deal, opex was up 13% Y/Y in FQ1 to $7.9B. That growth rate should drop in the coming quarters, and possibly turn negative.

Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center each grew by double digits, and Lync, SharePoint, and Exchange collectively saw double-digit growth. Windows volume licensing +10%.
Devices & Consumer revenue (boosted by the Nokia deal) +47% to $10.96B. Phone hardware revenue totaled $2.6B, down from $3.9B a year ago but above guidance of $1.9B-$2.3B. 2.4M Xboxes were sold (+102% thanks to the Xbox One launch), and Office Home/Personal subs rose by ~1.4M Q/Q to 7M+.  Surface revenue totaled $908M.
One soft spot: Dollar-wise, a 9% drop in D&C Licensing revenue to $4.09B more than offset a 16% increase in D&C Other revenue (inc. Web and cloud services) to $1.81B. OEM non-Pro Windows revenue fell 1%, though Windows consumer unit growth was positive.
Commercial Licensing made up 61% of Microsoft's gross profit, and Commercial Other (inc. cloud services) 5%. D&C Licensing accounted for 26%, and D&C Other just 2%.

""I think that if you’re not already spending a lot of capital in the order of four or five billion dollars each year to just grow your cloud, probably it’s a little too late to enter the market,"" Satya Nadella (NASDAQ:MSFT) asserted during a CNBC interview (video). Rackspace and VMware would probably beg to differ; Amazon and Google, maybe not so much.
The CNBC talk was followed by a webcast in which Nadella unveiled the Cloud Platform System, an on-premise appliance (to be sold by Dell) that enables Azure private cloud and (by linking with Microsoft's public cloud) hybrid cloud services. Microsoft has long argued Azure's strong hybrid cloud support (aided by the company's on-premise software) acts as a differentiator relative to Amazon/Google).

Also unveiled: 1) An Azure Marketplace that allows clients to quickly add apps and services from third parties; Amazon has something similar. 2) New high-performance Azure virtual machine and storage options. 3) Azure support for CoreOS, a Linux variant that's popular among companies deploying app containers (a lightweight alternative to virtualization software from the likes of Microsoft and VMware).
Driving home his multi-platform push, Nadella made the CoreOS announcement in front of a sign that (amusingly enough) read ""Microsoft [hearts] Linux.""

In addition, Now showed ""enhanced results"" (results featuring some kind of knowledge box/panel or structured data) 58% of the time; Siri did so 29% of the time, and Cortana 20%.
Stone Temple was also impressed with Now's ability to return complementary data and detailed results: A query of ""Burj Khalifa height"" returned (in addition to the skyscraper's height) the heights of various other buildings, and a query of ""becoming a firefighter"" returned step-by-step instructions from FireScience.org.
Now, which comes built into Google's version of Android and is available on iOS through the (well-downloaded) Google search app, both strengthens Google's mobile search position, and (to the extent the search app is used instead of Mobile Safari on iOS) lowers the company's search traffic acquisition payments to Apple.

Gartner estimates shipments fell only 0.5%. Developed markets continue faring better than emerging markets still getting hit by tablet cannibalization. IDC thinks U.S. shipments rose 4.3%, a bit slower than Q2's 6.9% growth. EMEA grew, while Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) declined. Japanese growth remained ""deeply negative."" The corporate migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 (following MSFT's ending of XP support) is still providing a lift, as is a soft tablet market. However, IDC cautions demand for ""large commercial refreshes"" remains low. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally managed to crack IDC's list of the top-5 global vendors: With the help of a strong U.S. market and Mac price cuts, Apple's unit share rose an estimated 60 bps to 6.3%. Revenue share is likely above 10%, given Apple's calendar Q2 Mac ASP was $1,255. U.S. unit share was at 13%.

Seyrafi also sees Microsoft's decision to end Windows Server 2003 support in July 2015 acting as a smaller catalyst. IDC has argued Microsoft's move could provide a lift to 2015 server sale, much as ending Win. XP support boosted enterprise PC sales this year.
Office, in the midst of a huge transition to subscription sales, accounted for 28% of Microsoft FY14 (ended June '14) revenue, and a much larger share of op. profit. Seyrafi expects Windows Server (also a high-margin product) to make up 7% of FY15 revenue.
The FBN analyst is also a fan of the healthy growth seen in Microsoft's unearned (deferred) revenue and contracted but not billed balances: The former rose 12% Y/Y in the June quarter, and the latter 14%. He sees the company returning ~50% of free cash flow to shareholders going forward, after returning 57% in FY14 and 49% in FY13.

As expected, Microsoft (MSFT -0.6%) is bringing back the Start menu, albeit a revamped version that supports resizable live tiles, and will allow touch-friendly Metro apps to launch in desktop mode. (live blog)
Myerson has tried hard to stress Windows 10 is meant to be enterprise-friendly; most businesses have ignored Windows 8 and stuck with Windows 7. He promises Windows 10 will be ""compatible with all the traditional management systems used today,"" and also provide ""a very novel approach of separating corporate and personal data across all devices.""
The OS is also meant to provide an integrated developer environment for PCs, tablets, and phones. However, the UI will vary considerably based on device type; phones naturally won't have a desktop mode.
Other new features include: 1) An improved universal search experience (integrated Bing/local results). 2) Improved multitasking features - a tool called Snap Assist allows apps to be quickly pulled from multiple desktops. 3) The ability for 2-in-1 devices to automatically switch between the desktop and Metro UIs based on their input mode.
Developers will get their hands on a Technical Preview shortly, but a commercial launch won't happen until mid-2015. After Windows 10, Microsoft is expected to shift to faster, more incremental Windows updates.

I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends returned in our stock.

1112,Microsoft sues Samsung over Android royalties,"
 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has sued Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) for alleged breach of contract over unpaid Android royalty payments related to the companies' 2011 licensing deal. Microsoft suggests Samsung stopped paying per-device royalties in late 2013 due to the Nokia deal, with Samsung arguing the deal nullifies the 2011 pact. Microsoft wants a ruling on Samsung's claim, and is also seeking unpaid interest. Likely at issue: Samsung and Nokia have a patent cross-licensing deal in place for each others' patents, one that was extended for 5 years last November. Though the deal involves payments from Samsung to Nokia, Nokia's phone unit (now a part of Microsoft) has made use of Samsung's IP through it. That opens the door to Samsung arguing a new/separate cross-licensing deal with Microsoft is needed. The financial implications of the legal spat could be big: Though struggling a bit lately, Samsung still had a 25.2% Q2 smartphone unit share (per IDC).
Surging Android royalties led Microsoft's ""Windows Phone"" revenue to rise $1.2B in FY13 (ended June '13). With Samsung apparently halting payments midway, ""Windows Phone"" licensing revenue grew by $822M in FY14 to $2.54B. Nokia payments accounted for $382M of the total.  ",2014-08-1

Also likely playing a role: The Nokia phone unit (about to see massive job cuts) is expected to see FQ1 revenue of $1.9B-$2.3B; that's down from a year-ago level of $3.9B. 5.8M Lumia phones were sold in FQ4 during the 2 months following the closing of the Nokia deal, with low-end phones making up ""a majority"" of the volume; 7.4M Lumias were sold over the unit's full June quarter last year.

As part of the company's huge layoffs, Microsoft (MSFT +1.3%) is shutting down its Xbox Entertainment Studios unit. The unit, which was working on original programming for Xbox Live, was formed in 2012 and headed by ex-CBS Network chief Nancy Tellem.
Microsoft also plans to wind down the Nokia unit's long-struggling feature phone ops. In an internal memo picked up by The Verge, Nokia phone chief Jo Harlow says the unit's Asha, Series 40, and Nokia X lines will shift to ""maintenance mode,"" with services supporting existing hardware closing within 18 months.
The Verge adds Microsoft is planning to hand off Nokia's MixRadio music service to a third party. Meanwhile, a memo from hardware chief/ex-Nokia CEO Stephen Elop suggests multiple manufacturing/engineering sites will be closed, and says the Nokia unit will ""focus on driving Lumia volume in the areas where we are already successful today.""
Nosediving feature phone sales led Nokia's phone unit to post a 30% Y/Y Q1 revenue drop to €1.93B, and a -16.9% op. margin.

The layoffs are expected to be finished by the end of FY15 (ends June '15), and to result in a $1.1B-$1.6B charge. $750M-$800M of that total will be related to severance and other benefit costs, and $350M-$800M will be tied to asset-related charges.

The traditional Windows desktop UI will be placed ""front and center"" on regular PCs; 2-in-1 devices will switch between desktop and Metro modes, and phones/tablets will be Metro-only.
As indicated at the BUILD conference, the Start menu will return, replete with embedded live tiles, and users will be able to run Metro-style apps in desktop windows. A public preview is expected this fall ahead of a spring 2015 launch.

1138,Microsoft launches another Android phone,"

Four months after Nokia launched 3 low-end Android phones (the Nokia X, X+, and XL), Microsoft (MSFT -0.5%) has launched the €99 ($135) X2. The device sports a 4.3"" display (bigger than the X's 4"" display) to go with 1GB of RAM and a dual-core, 1.2GHz., CPU.
Like the prior models, the X2 doesn't run on Google's version of Android, and thus lack the apps/services normally bundled with it (Play, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Now). Microsoft and Nokia's apps/services take their place.
Nonetheless, the phones allow Microsoft to sell devices that can leverage much of Android's app ecosystem (still far larger than Windows Phone's) as it battles with Google and its OEM partners for prepaid/emerging markets buyers.
PC Magazine's Sascha Segan isn't convinced Microsoft is committed to Android long-term, especially since the price delta between the X line and low-end Windows Phones is about to dissipate. ""Phone development cycles are still well over a year ... there were plenty of sunk costs, and the really low-cost Windows phones aren't ready yet. [The X2] just barely aligns with Microsoft's strategy, but it aligns.""

Importantly, Google remains the default search provider for Safari, which in turn acts as the default iOS/Mac OS browser. But the Spotlight switch is still a noteworthy loss for Google, given the feature's tight integration with Apple's platforms - an iOS user only has to swipe down from his/her home screen to access Spotlight, and a new search box will provide quick access for Mac OS users.
As for Bing, the deal provides a needed mobile win for a search engine estimated by StatCounter to have just a 5.48% global mobile/tablet search share as of May - 1.77% for Bing proper, 3.71% for Yahoo - to Google's 93.5%. Bing replaced Google as Siri's search engine last year.

The companies are also reportedly discussing a data-integration deal involving Salesforce's apps and Office.
The report is particularly notable in light of the rivalry between the companies: Microsoft's Dynamics CRM apps (offered both on-premise and over the cloud) compete against Salesforce's apps, and Azure squares off against Salesforce's Heroku and (to a lesser extent) Force.com PaaS platforms.
But Satya Nadella has made it clear he's willing to increase Redmond's support for rival products/platforms when customers demand it. Microsoft is also intent on pulling out all the stops to challenge Amazon's public cloud leadership; Azure revenue rose 150% Y/Y in the March quarter.
Last year, Salesforce struck a data integration deal with another major rival, Oracle. That deal also called for Salesforce to standardize to buy Oracle's Exadata systems and standardize on its databases/middleware. More recently, Salesforce launched a service that lets Heroku apps built by third parties integrate with Salesforce's apps.

Although defense names have done well over the past couple of years, the Magic Formula continues to identify Northrop Grumman (NOC +0.2%), General Dynamics (GD +1.4%), and Raytheon (RTN +0.6%) as attractive. Firearm names Smith & Wesson (SWHC +0.8%) and Sturm Ruger (RGR +0.3%) also make the cut.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its CC for FQ4 revenue of $20.4B-$21B, slightly below a $21.04B consensus. The company's FQ3 guidance proved conservative, and investors are assuming as much for its FQ4 outlook.
The revenue outlook for individual reporting groups: devices & consumer licensing $4.1B-$4.3B, D&C hardware $1.3B-$1.5B, D&C other $1.9B, commercial licensing $11B-$11.2B, commercial other $2.1B.
Xbox channel inventory drawdown is expected to impact D&C hardware, and a lower impact from Win. 7 upgrades caused by the end of XP support will affect D&C licensing. Commercial other is expected to see ~10% Q/Q growth on the back of cloud services (Office 365, Azure) demand.
Opex is expected to grow 4% Y/Y to $8.4B-$8.6B after adjusting for an EU fine. Capex is expected to total $1.5B (cloud investments), and unearned revenue to grow in line with seasonality. A tax rate of 18%-20% is forecast.
Microsoft's unearned revenue balance rose 14% Y/Y in FQ3 to $19.5B, topping guidance and exceeding FQ2's 12% clip. Bookings rose 6%, down from FQ2's 12%. The company's contracted but not billed balance closed above $22B (up over $1B Y/Y).

Commercial Licensing (50% of revenue, 65% of gross profit) sales +10% vs. +7%, with Windows volume licensing up 11% and and key server productivity offerings (Lync, SharePoint, Exchange) collectively growing double-digits.
Commercial Other +31% vs. +28%; 100% and 150% respective increases for Office 365 and Azure fueled the growth. The division is now nearly 10% of revenue, but still makes up less than 4% of gross profit (lower cloud margins).
D&C licensing rose 1% after falling 6% in FQ2, thanks in part to stabilizing PC sales; Windows OEM revenue rose 4%.
D&C hardware +41% (thanks to Xbox One sales) ahead of the Nokia deal's closing; Surface revenue totaled just $500M. D&C Other +18%; Office 365 Home added almost 1M subs, raising its total base to 4.4M.

1197,Microsoft nears $40 after Office iPad report; Xbox product chief leaving,"

Microsoft's (MSFT +4.1%) reported plans to unveil Office iPad apps on March 27 are not only ""directionally positive"" for driving Office 365 demand, but are likely part of a broader effort by Satya Nadella to reposition Microsoft as a ""mobile first/cloud first company"" thinks Nomura's Rick Sherlund, bullish as ever.
Shares have made new post-Dot.com bubble highs, and are within striking distance of $40.
The iPad accounted for roughly a third of Q4 tablet shipments, but (from all indications) its enterprise share is much higher. ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley observes the iPad Office apps appear set to arrive before Microsoft's touch-friendly Gemini Office Windows apps (expected later this year).
Separately, Xbox chief product officer and long-time Xbox Live chief Marc Whitten has announced he's leaving to become the product chief of home audio system maker Sonos. Xbox division chief Don Mattrick left last year to become the CEO of Zynga, and another key Xbox exec, Blair Westlake, departed in January in response to the 2013 reorg.

Sources tell The Verge (pretty accurate with its Microsoft scoops) Satya Nadella will unveil an iPad Office suite at a March 27 San Francisco event where he'll talk up Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) mobile and cloud ambitions. Currently, iPad users have to make do with the Office Web Apps.
Not surprisingly, the apps will require an Office 365 subscription, much like the Office iPhone and Android apps released last year. Since the release of those apps, Google has made its Quickoffice productivity suite free, and Apple has made its iWork suite free to buyers of new iDevices.
Office remains Microsoft's biggest money-maker: Before changing up its reporting, the company's Business Division (dominated by Office) had FY13 op. income of $16.2B, well above the $9.5B produced by the Windows unit and the $8.2B produced by Server & Tools.
In a move viewed by some as a prelude to an iPad launch, Microsoft recently rolled out a Personal edition of Office 365 that goes for only $70/year, 30% less than Office Home Premium (supports up to 5 PCs).

 Nokia (NOK -0.4%) says it is considering its options after India's Supreme Court rejected its appeal against a demand for a multimillion-dollar payment before it transfers a mobile phone plant and other assets in the country to Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%). The ruling upholds a lower court verdict ordering NOK to pay a 35B rupee ($572.5M) guarantee after local authorities blocked the factory's transfer in a tax dispute; as a result, the factory - a critical part of the smartphone business MSFT is purchasing - remains shut. If the Indian manufacturing plant is not transferred to MSFT, it could mean less money for NOK from the deal; NOK could run it as a contractor to MSFT but not for long, the company has said in court hearings.

Citing ""slowing consumer purchases"" amid high penetration rates in mature markets, IDC now forecasts tablet shipments will grow 19.4% in 2014 (to 260.9M units), down from a prior estimate of 22% (271M units).
Tablet growth steadily slowed in 2014: Shipments rose an estimated 142% in Q1, but just 28% in Q4. IDC puts full-year growth at 52%.
Two silver linings for high-end/enterprise leader Apple (AAPL - 33.8% Q4 share): 1) ASPs are only expected to drop 3.6% in 2014, after falling 14.6% in 2013, as more consumers embrace ""higher-end devices."" 2) Commercial buyers are expected to account for 14% of shipments, up from 11% in 2013.
IDC also thinks Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) tablets, struggling to gain a strong consumer foothold, will take over a quarter of the commercial segment thanks to rising convertible adoption.
The revised forecast still puts tablet sales within striking distance of eclipsing PC sales: IDC expects PC shipments to drop 6% this year to 295.9M. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow 19% to 1.2B.

Sources tell Bloomberg Steve Ballmer ""shouted at a June meeting"" that if Microsoft's (MSFT -1.1%) board didn't back his plans to acquire Nokia's phone and mapping units, he could no longer be CEO.
Bill Gates and new CEO Satya Nadella initially opposed the Nokia deal, as did the departing Tony Bates. Nadella later relented; Bates didn't. Though Ballmer mostly got his way - the final deal didn't include the mapping unit - Bloomberg states his antics were ""the last straw"" for some directors.
The news service also states Alan Mulally's ego ""got in the way"" of his CEO candidacy. Though the Ford CEO expressed interest in running Microsoft, he refused to formally interview.
With Gates and other directors deciding a CEO with a tech background was needed, and many candidates (inc. Mulally) worried about Gates/Ballmer's continued influence, Nadella eventually got the job.
Microsoft's shares tumbled the day after the Nokia deal was announced. Nokia's phone unit saw a 29% Y/Y sales drop in Q4, as plunging feature phone sales more than offset Lumia growth.
During a recent talk, Ballmer said his biggest mobile regret is that Microsoft didn't offer integrated hardware/software solutions earlier. The remarks come shortly after Google, provider of the world's dominant mobile OS in terms of unit share, struck a deal to sell its phone unit.

In-line with past reports, the phone is said to be a low-end device aimed at emerging markets, and thus appears meant to be an alternative to Nokia's Asha feature phones than mid-range or high-end Lumia models.
Recent leaks have indicated the phone will have a Windows Phone-like UI, and come with unmistakably low-end specs (4"" 800x480 display, dual-core 1GHz. QCOM Snapdragon CPU).
Both the WSJ and others have reported the phone won't support the apps/services that come with Google's version of Android (Play, Gmail, Maps, Now, etc.). Instead, Nokia/Microsoft services will be pre-installed, including a Nokia Android app store (its selection is bound to be much smaller than Google Play's).
Nokia's phone unit posted a 29% Y/Y sales drop in Q4, a decline that had much to do with plunging feature phone sales in the face of booming low-end Android phone sales in emerging markets.

Microsoft launched Office iPhone and Android apps last year (available to Office 365 subs), and has suggested it will eventually launch Office iPad apps.
Much as many (though by no means all) of Microsoft's PC and mobile apps only run on Windows and Windows Phone, the company's server-based software typically runs on Windows Server.
Bloomberg's scoop comes amid widespread reports enterprise/cloud product chief Satya Nadella is set to become Microsoft's next CEO.

1230,Report: Yahoo working on search tech that could displace Microsoft,"


Kara Swisher reports Marissa Mayer (YHOO +2%) has launched two projects - codenamed Fast Break and Curveball - aimed at creating proprietary search and search ad technology, and that the efforts are ""part of a contemplation of how Yahoo can accelerate the end or even end its long-term search and advertising partnership with Microsoft (MSFT +2.7%).""
The effort is said to involve top Yahoo execs, including three product SVPs, and to feature just a 3-4 month timeframe. Over time, it  could ""result in a full search engine, possibly more oriented to mobile than the desktop.""
Marissa Mayer has voiced displeasure with the performance of the Microsoft deal, under which Yahoo's results and search ad platform are powered by Bing, and has reportedly considered abandoning it before.
However, the deal is set to last until 2020 and currently features revenue/search guarantees (the latest renewal expires in March). Any attempt to create a fully-fledged search alternative to Google and Bing would carry both monetization risks and require massive R&D investments.
Yahoo's search paid clicks rose 17% Y/Y in Q4, less than Google's 31%. StatCounter estimates Yahoo has a 3.1% global search share, compared with a 90.3% share for Google and a 3.3% share for Bing. Yahoo's mobile/tablet search share is pegged at 3.99%.

After selling off Microsoft (MSFT +1.5%) shares in response to news Alan Mulally won't replace Steve Ballmer, investors have bid them higher following a report Satya Nadella is set to receive the nod, and that Bill Gates might step down as chairman.

Analysts and pundits generally praise Nadella's technical expertise and product development skills, as well as his success at creating profitable/growing enterprise businesses. Microsoft's commercial reporting segments accounted for 65% of its gross profit during the December quarter.
At the same time, some worry Nadella won't make the kind of sweeping changes (major cost cuts, the shedding of unprofitable units) that were expected of Mulally, and have reportedly been considered by Stephen Elop.
Meanwhile, Kara Swisher reports that while Gates' resignation as chairman ""seems likelier than not,"" he'll nonetheless remain on the board and be ""spending a lot more time at the company once Nadella is approved.""
She also reports Ballmer appears set to leave Microsoft's board once his current term is up.
Top investors (including ValueAct?) have reportedly been worried Gates would prevent Microsoft's next CEO from making big changes if he remains chairman.

Update: Swisher follows up by reporting Microsoft's board is set to meet this weekend, and that its CEO announcement will come next week.

Update 2: The WSJ reports Nadella has entered into CEO contract talks with Microsoft's board. The paper suggests Gates' possible resignation as chairman stems from Nadella's wish to have Gates assist him by spending ""more time on technology and strategy.""

With equities getting routed today, Microsoft (MSFT +2.9%) has given back a chunk of the AH gains it saw following yesterday's FQ2 beat, but is still soundly outperforming.
By and large, the sell-side is pleased with Microsoft's enterprise strength, hardware sales, and cost controls. Credit Suisse has upped its PT to $42.50 from $40, while predicting Windows profitability and growth will improve in the next two quarters. It also expects Azure/Office 365 will generate ""meaningfully higher"" lifetime sales and profits than traditional licenses, in spite of near-term revenue cannibalization.

Jefferies is reiterating a Buy and $42 PT, and sees the ""option value"" on the Windows business (expected by the firm to decline 7.5%/year perpetually) rising following better-than-feared FQ2 numbers. But Goldman, which has been bearish since April, thinks FY14/FY15 estimates will keep dropping.
On the CC (transcript), CFO Amy Hood stated the macro environment is ""a little better than [Microsoft] thought,"" and that enterprise Windows sales are benefiting both from Win. 7 upgrades and a shift towards more costly enterprise SKUs.
She also mentioned Microsoft was able to beat gross margin expectations in spite of a larger hardware mix by lowering costs in other areas, and claimed share gains in database (SQL Server) and systems management software (System Center).

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its FQ2 CC for its various reporting segments to collectively post FQ3 revenue of $20B-$20.5B. That compares with a $20.47B consensus. Given two straight quarters of solid revenue beats, investors might view the guidance as conservative.
The software giant is also lowering its FY14 (ends June '14) opex guidance range to $31.2B-$31.5B from a prior $31.3B-$31.9B, and cutting its FY14 capex budget by $500M to $6B. Microsoft's original capex budget wasn't well-received when first issued.
Microsoft isn't shy about highlighting its FQ2 enterprise numbers: The company states server product sales rose 12% Y/Y, and Office Commercial and Windows volume licensing sales 10% apiece. It also estimates Hyper-V gained 5 points of virtualization share; Hyper-V has been taking share from VMware's (NYSE:VMW) market-leading vSphere platform for some time.
Office consumer sales fell 24% Y/Y,; Microsoft attributes 2/3 of the drop to a shift to Office 365 Home Premium, which now has over 3.5M subs (up from 2M in October).

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Commercial Licensing revenue (Office, enterprise Windows, and Server & Tools licenses) rose 7% Y/Y in FQ2 (even with FQ1), and accounted for 44% of revenue and 62% of gross profit.
Commercial Other revenue, meanwhile, jumped 28% Y/Y for the second straight quarter, thanks to continued triple-digit growth for commercial cloud (Azure, enterprise Office 365) revenue. But the segment's gross margin (23%) is well below that of Commercial Licensing (93%).
Microsoft asserts it ""significantly outpaced enterprise IT spend"" by taking share.
Professional Windows OEM license revenue rose 12% Y/Y thanks to strong corporate Win. 7 upgrade activity. That, in turn, resulted in total Windows OEM revenue falling only 3% (vs. -7% in FQ1 and -15% in FQ4) in spite of ongoing consumer weakness.
Devices & Consumer Licensing (Windows OEM, consumer Office, Windows Phone, Android royalties) revenue fell 6% Y/Y. D&C hardware, boosted by the Xbox One launch, grew 68% Y/Y. Microsoft says it sold 3.9M Xbox One units into retail channels, and that Surface revenue rose over 2x Q/Q to $893M. D&C Other (Xbox Live, consumer Office 365, Windows Store) revenue fell 10%.

Regarding Oracle, Keirstead thinks concerns about share loss to cloud app providers are priced in at a valuation of 11x 2015E EPS, and thinks app weakness can be offset by database strengths.

Keirstead believes ""the near-term set-up is not ideal"" for Salesforce, even if the company remains ""an attractive medium-term play on the cloud computing trend.""

Though reiterating an Outperform, FBR is skeptical about Intel's long-term 15% revenue CAGR target for its server CPU division. Bernstein questioned the division's growth outlook yesterday afternoon.

Goldman, reiterating a Sell (previous), says Intel's numbers ""confirm our view that there is downside, not upside, to Intel's 2014 EPS."" It's worried about both server CPU sales and a softening corporate PC upgrade cycle (driven by the Windows 7 transition) following Q1.

JPMorgan, which upgraded Intel going into earnings, is defending the company. It's pleased with stabilizing PC demand and dismisses server concerns, given sales have historically been volatile.
A major headwind faced by Intel's server CPU unit: Server industry revenues have been steadily declining, as demand shifts towards Web/cloud service providers with bigger economies of scale and a penchant for using cheap white-label hardware. IDC estimates total server sales fell 3.7% Y/Y in Q3, and that x86 server sales rose just 2.8%.

The company will pay an FY dividend of ¥100 instead of ¥260. Nintendo said the dramatic reversal was due to much lower-than-expected sales of its Wii U and 3DS games machines during the holiday season.

Blackledge (unsurprisingly) takes aim at Twitter's valuation, and also reports a survey of 50 ad buyers suggests Twitter's ad ROI is worse than Facebook (FB -1.7%) and LinkedIn's (LNKD +2.3%). ~60% of respondents claimed Facebook delivered the best ad ROI, ~25% said LinkedIn did so, and only ~5% picked Twitter.

RBC offered a more upbeat take last month, stating 40% of polled Twitter advertisers have seen improved ROIs over the prior six months, and that a similar number have increased their Twitter spend.
Much like Facebook in 2012/early 2013, Twitter has been busy rolling out a barrage of new ad products, as it works to provide better targeting and improve its ad revenue per 1K timeline views from a Q3 level of just $0.97 ($2.58 in the U.S., $0.36 internationally).

1256,Report: Microsoft CEO decision not expected this month,"

It looks as if the Microsoft (MSFT -1.6%) CEO guessing game will continue a while longer: Multiple sources tell Kara Swisher the software giant won't name Steve Ballmer's successor before February, if not later. A variety of factors are said to be responsible, including a packed January schedule for Bill Gates.
Though director John Thompson (previously said a decision would be made in early 2014) leads the search committee, a source says Gates is still heading the search process. The WSJ has reported external candidates are uneasy about Gates and Ballmer maintaining influential roles on Microsoft's board going forward.
Swisher reports enterprise software/services chief Satya Nadella remains the top internal CEO candidate, and that he's ""a favorite among employees due to his geekier cred."" But external candidates are still being considered, and concerns exist about Nadella's business/sales expertise.

 Sony (SNE +0.1%) announces at CES PlayStation 4 end-user sales (i.e. sell-through) reached 4.2M as of Dec. 28. That figure suggests the PS4 soundly outsold the Xbox One (MSFT - 3M+ sales in 2013) last year, and has a good chance of surpassing Sony's target of 5M FY14 (ends March '14) sales. Wider distribution - the PS4 is on sale in 53 countries, the One is only available in 13 - has helped Sony's next-gen console outsell Microsoft's. But so has a lower price tag ($399 vs. $499) and the backlash to the used game restriction and Internet access requirements initially planned for the One (before Microsoft backtracked). Sony has also announced the launch of PlayStation Now, its anticipated cloud gaming service. The service, which leverages Gaikai's cloud gaming platform, will provide access to PS2/PS3 titles, and (since it's cloud-based) run on everything from home consoles to TV sets to handheld/mobile devices. Also announced: a Web-based TV service that will include VOD content and a cloud-based DVR. However, Sony is short on details for now. Intel and others have taken stab at offering such a service, only to be thwarted by content owners and incumbent pay-TV providers.

The WSJ reports external candidates contacted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) during its drawn-out CEO search ""have expressed concerns about being hamstrung"" by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, should they remain on the company's board.
Candidates are said to be particularly nervous about Ballmer remaining involved, and question whether he would stand idly if a new CEO embraced a very different strategy from his own.
Nonetheless, Gates and Ballmer (combined 8.3% stake in Microsoft) reportedly lack veto power over Microsoft's CEO choice.
Director/search committee chief John Thompson stated last month Microsoft expects to finish its CEO search in early 2014, and (citing comments from Gates) suggested the company was looking for a candidate able to lead ""a highly technical organization.""

Sources tell The Verge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its OEM partners plan to show off tablets/convertibles capable of simultaneously running Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) at CES. The products will reportedly be able to run Android and Windows apps side by side.
Though Samsung and Asus have experimented with Android/Windows hybrids, there hasn't yet been a major push behind the concept, which fuses the world's most popular mobile and PC platforms. Intel is uniquely positioned to address the opportunity, since its x86 CPUs, unlike ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) CPUs, can run both Android and Windows 8.
However, sources state neither Microsoft nor Google supports the initiative, given doing so means indirectly supporting a rival platform. Microsoft, which is scrambling to improve developer support for Windows Phone and Metro-style Windows apps, might be especially on edge.
The Verge observes Microsoft could make OEMs think twice by withholding marketing support and/or license discounts, and that Google could restrict access to Google Play and others apps/services.
Ironically, investment firm Longboard Asset Management declared in October Android/Windows hybrids are a key reason to be bullish on Microsoft. The firm called such products a ""game changer"" for the software giant, particularly in the enterprise.
Likewise, the devices could strengthen Google's high-end and enterprise tablet positions. The iPad still claims an outsized share of these segments, even as Android has gobbled up low-end tablet share.

ITG Research offered a cautious view on LinkedIn's Q4 two weeks ago. The company's ad business (23% of Q3 revenue) has been seeing relatively slow growth, something generally blamed on a transition to news feed ads (a shift towards mobile viewing could also be playing a role).

Teen engagement worries or not, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still the unquestioned colossus of the U.S. social media scene. A Pew survey (.pdf) of 6,010 Americans found 71% claiming to use Facebook, up from 67% in 2012. That compares with 22% for LinkedIn (LNKD - up from 20%), 21% for Pinterest (up from 15%), 18% for Twitter (TWTR - up from 16%), and 17% for Facebook-owned Instagram (up from 13%).
Facebook's success at reeling in older users has helped it continue growing: 45% of respondents age 65 or older said they use Facebook, up from 35% a year ago. 63% of users say they check in daily, and 22% weekly.
Unsurprisingly, Twitter and Instagram's user bases skew young: 31% and 37% of respondents in the age 18-29 demographic respectively use Twitter and Instagram, compared with 9% and 6% in the 50-64 demographic. 46% of Twitter users say they check in daily, a level notably below Facebook's 63% and Instagram's 57%.
A mere 13% of LinkedIn users claim to check in daily, evidence the company's efforts to boost engagement need more work. But the platform is used by 38% of respondents making over $75K, and 27% of all employed respondents. LinkedIn's recruiting and ad clients will be happy to know that.

Microsoft's pending acquisition of Nokia's phone business has fueled concerns third parties will now be reluctant to license WP, particularly since Nokia is the market's dominant player. AdDuplex just estimated Nokia hardware accounts for 92.1% of the WP installed base. But OEM concerns about becoming too dependent on Google could leave Microsoft with an opening. Though IDC estimates WP only had a 3.6% Q3 global smartphone unit share, Kantar Worldpanel believes the OS is faring much better in Europe, assigning it a double-digit share within the EU5.

Nomura's Rick Sherlund, who not long ago predicted Mulally would be Microsoft's next CEO, now wonders if the Bill Gates quote included in Thompson's remarks indicates ""the board is rethinking the role and looking more exhaustively at candidates from the technology field.""

Fresh off writing about a Nokia Android phone project, The Verge reports Microsoft (MSFT -1.6%) is thinking of eliminating licensing fees for Windows Phone and RT, and focusing on monetizing the platforms via ads and services subscriptions.
In practice, such a move would make it cheaper to license Windows Phone than Android (NASDAQ:GOOG), given Microsoft collects significant Android royalties from top OEMs.
Though Windows Phone has achieved a double-digit smartphone unit share in certain European and emerging markets, IDC estimates the OS only had a 3.6% global share in Q3, thanks in large part to small U.S. and Chinese shares. With regards to the latter, it's worth noting Microsoft doesn't collect royalties on a large portion of Chinese Android shipments, particularly those form white-label OEMs.
RT, meanwhile, has fallen flat since its 2012 launch. PC OEMs have largely abandoned the ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) OS, which may be merged with Windows Phone down the line, to focus on building Windows 8 and Android tablets.

Eight days after Sony (NYSE:SNE) announced it had sold 2.1M+ PlayStation 4 units since its Nov. 15 launch, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) says it has sold 2M+ Xbox One units since its Nov. 22 launch.
A spokesman says the One, whose $499 price tag had worried some observers, is selling at a faster clip than the Xbox 360 did following its launch, and is sold out at most retail locations.

Nomura had previously suggested 3M-4M 2013 One sales were likely; Microsoft's latest figure suggests it's on its way to hitting that range. The firm had also cautioned the Xbox unit could lose over $1B in 2013 after accounting for all expenses.

Separately, AllThingsD has followed up on The Verge's report about a Nokia low-end/custom Android phone by stating ""there is a sense"" within Nokia that Microsoft ""may be willing to pursue the project.""
A Nokia source states the phone's software ""has a look more similar to Windows Phone than to the 'squircle' icons used on the Asha,"" and would deliver Microsoft services (Bing, Skype, etc.).

Multiple sources tell The Verge Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) phone unit has been working on a low-end Android phone even as the business gets set to be sold to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). A 2014 launch is said to be planned.
The phone, codenamed Normandy, reportedly features (like Amazon's Kindle Fire line) a non-Google-approved version of Android. That means it can't feature Google Play, or commonly pre-installed Google apps/services such as YouTube, Maps, Gmail, and Now. Sources compare the product to Nokia's Asha feature phones.
The NYT previously reported Nokia worked on Android phones before the Microsoft deal was announced. However, the deal prohibits Nokia from selling phones under the Nokia brand until 2016. Moreover, maintaining a phone business, and the patent cross-licenses needed for it, could undercut Nokia's efforts to better monetize its IP.
Thus, Microsoft will probably have the final call on whether to sell the phone. Thanks in large part to the Lumia 520 and variants, Windows Phone has made decent gains in the low-end smartphone market. But it hasn't yet reached the unsubsidized price points (well below $100) delivered by the cheapest Android phones. In the meantime, those Android phones are eating into Nokia's feature phone business.

He also sees room for Groupon to improve its customer targeting - the company still isn't able to track which deals were shown to customers, or were clicked on, in prior e-mails - and expects its new site (allows deals to be browsed without an e-mail address being given) and a revamped e-mail layout to boost growth.

 Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) tax bill in India could hit $3.4B, a government official says, far higher than the $340M that has been at the center of a dispute so far. India has frozen Nokia assets in the country to ensure the company has enough money to pay the smaller bill, although the firm has gone to court to defend itself. Nokia needs access to the assets by Thursday so that it can complete the sale of its handset unit to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and it has set aside $350M for the purpose.  ",2013-12-10
1290,Microsoft reportedly looking to bring back Windows Start menu,"


Paul Thurrott reports Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is looking to bring back Windows' traditional Start menu with its 2015 Threshold OS updates (previous). The company is also said to be interested in allowing users to run (touch-friendly) Metro-style apps in desktop mode.
Microsoft brought back the Start button with Windows 8.1, but not the full-blown Start menu; a power menu can be accessed by right-clicking the button.
Meanwhile, Mary Jo Foley reports Threshold could feature the release of three Windows variants (SKUs): A ""modern"" consumer SKU focused on Windows RT apps and touch devices; a ""traditional"" consumer SKU meant to placate keyboard/mouse users; and an enterprise SKU featuring ""all the usual business bells and whistles.""
The reports come at a time when Windows 8/8.1's adoption rate continues to significantly trail that delivered by Windows 7 following its launch, thanks to minimal enterprise uptake and ongoing complaints about its dual UIs and lack of a traditional Start menu.

 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among eight technology giants that have started a campaign to limit government online surveillance. The other companies are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), AOL (NYSE:AOL) and LinkedIn (LNKD). The move appears to represent an attempt by the companies to prevent a loss of business because of Edward Snowden's revelations about the scope of the National Security Agency's spying campaign. Forrester estimates that the disclosures could cost the U.S. cloud computing industry $180B by 2016. While the firms want limits on governmental authority to collect user information, as well as increased oversight, given the tech industry's own data practices, some might say that there's more than a whiff of the pots calling the kettles black.

1292,"Server sales drop again in Q3, H-P takes share from IBM","


IDC estimates server sales fell 3.7% Y/Y in Q3. That's a modest improvement from Q2's estimated 6.2% drop, but hardly a figure that will bring cheer to industry players. Gartner estimates revenue fell 2.1% in Q3 vs. 3.8% in Q2.

The embrace by Web/cloud giants of home-grown servers produced by Asian contract manufacturers (ODMs) continues to upend the industry. IDC thinks sales of such servers rose 45% Y/Y, and now make up 6.5% of industry revenue. It estimates nearly 4/5 of these sales came from the U.S., largely from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Rackspace.
#1 H-P (HPQ), which recently reported encouraing enterprise hardware numbers, is assigned a 28.1% share (+150 bps Y/Y) by IDC. #2 IBM, whose total Q3 hardware sales fell 17% Y/Y, is given a 23.4% share (-430 bps).
Newly-private Dell had a 16.2% share (-40 bps, a reversal from recent gains), Cisco (CSCO - still seeing strong UCS server demand) a 5% share (+170 bps), and Oracle (ORCL - hurt by SPARC/UNIX server weakness) a 4.1% share (-60 bps).
In a positive for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), x86 servers took share once again, with sales rising 2.8% and making up 79% of industry revenue. Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) is likely pleased to see Linux servers now make up 28% of industry revenue. Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) servers made up 50%, and UNIX servers just 11%.
H-P is the leader in the x86 server market (32.3% share), as well as in the growing blade server (43.6%) and density-optimized server (30.7%) markets. There's a decent amount of overlap between the x86 and blade/density-optimized markets.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has finished selling $8B worth of debt in a massive dual-currency offering. In addition to selling €3.5B worth of euro-denominated bonds, the software giant has sold $3.25B worth of dollar-denominated debt.
Unsurprisingly, the yields for the dollar-denominated notes are also quite low. $1.25B worth of 5-year bonds carry an interest rate spread of just 35 bps relative to comparable Treasurys; $1.5B worth of 10-year bonds have a 90 bps spread, and $500M worth of 30-year bonds have a 105 bps spread.
Microsoft isn't saying much about what it plans to do with the proceeds, but buybacks are a good bet. In addition to boosting EPS, eliminating shares via buybacks removes the dividend payments (current yield of 2.9%) attached to them.

The offering comes a couple months after Microsoft announced a new $40B buyback authorization. The company ended its Sep. quarter with $92.6B in cash/investments, and $15.9B in debt.

After forecasting in August global PC shipments would fall 9.7% Y/Y in 2013, IDC now estimates they'll drop 10.1% to 314.2M. Consumer shipments are expected to drop 15%, and commercial shipments (tend to have higher ASPs) 5%.
Interestingly, emerging markets (shipments -11% to 182.1M) are expected to see a slightly larger drop than ""mature markets"" (-8% to 132M). There have been signs of stabilizing demand in the U.S. and certain other developed markets.
IDC's forecast cut comes even though the firm thinks shipment declines moderated to a 7.6% Y/Y clip in Q3, after dropping 11.4% in Q2. In addition, H-P (HPQ +0.8%) just reported a mere 2% Y/Y PC sales drop for its Oct. quarter, and Intel (INTC -1%) stated the PC market is ""beginning to show signs of stabilization,"" albeit while providing disappointing 2014 guidance.
IDC expects shipments to drop another 3.8% in 2014 before ""turning slightly positive in the longer term."" It foresees 2017 shipments (naturally hard to predict) of 305.1M - barely above 2008 levels.
For reference, IDC has predicted smartphone shipments will rise 39% this year to 1.01B (over 3x PC shipments), and tablet shipments will rise 58% to 227M (72% of PC shipments).

Investors are apparently pleased with a Bloomberg report claiming Alan Mulally and Satya Nadella are now the frontrunners to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's (MSFT +1.7%) next CEO.
If an earlier AllThingsD report is accurate, the choice may not be an either/or one. The site reported Mulally is the top candidate for the job, but (if chosen) would act as a ""caretaker"" CEO paving the way for a lieutenant, and that Nadella as the top choice for the latter role.
Nadella, now in charge of enterprise/cloud product development, ran (before the reorg) a Server & Tools unit that posted 9% sales growth and 13% op. profit growth in FY13.
The business has arguably been Microsoft's biggest success story in recent years, gaining share and obtaining top-5 (if not top-3) positions in markets as disparate as server operating systems (Windows Server), databases (SQL server), virtualization (Hyper-V), systems management (System Center), and cloud app platforms (Azure).

Though Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been seeing intensifying competition in the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, Synergy Research's numbers, like Gartner's, suggest AWS continues to dominate.

Synergy estimates AWS had a 35% IaaS share in Q3, or 5x that of #2 IBM, whose position has been bolstered by SoftLayer. All other vendors are assigned shares below 3%.
The situation is a little different in the cloud app platform (PaaS) market. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Heroku, long a major player, is given a market-leading 18% share. But AWS is close behind at 17%, and so are Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Azure (14%) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) App Engine (13%). All other vendors are estimated to have sub-5% shares.
Altogether, Synergy thinks Amazon grew its IaaS/PaaS revenue by 55% Y/Y, outpacing the 46% growth seen by the overall market. Moreover, AWS' IaaS/PaaS revenue is believed to have eclipsed that of Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce combined.
The report drives home the competitive challenges faced by Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), and other firms striving to take IaaS and/or PaaS share from market leaders.
Synergy thinks the traditional Web hosting market, which Rackspace remains well-exposed to, and which has been pressured by the IaaS market's rise, only grew 3% Y/Y in Q3.
Last week, Stanley Druckenmiller cited AWS and its disruptive impact on traditional enterprise IT as a reason for shorting IBM.

After tearing down the device, IHS estimates the Xbox One (MSFT -0.1%) and its bundled Kinect sensor cost $471 to produce. The Kinect accounts for $75 of that total.
With the console sporting a retail price of $499, that suggests Microsoft could be selling the One for a loss after accounting for expenses such as such as fulfillment costs and retailer cuts. As with past consoles, manufacturing costs are bound to decline over time, as component prices come down.
Interestingly, IHS thinks CPU/GPU supplier AMD (AMD +2.2%) receives $110 per One unit. That's $10 more than the firm thinks AMD gets for each shipment of a very similar processor going into the PlayStation 4 (total estimated manufacturing cost of $381).
The report comes a few days after Microsoft announced it sold 1M One units in the console's first 24 hours of availability, and a day after Nomura predicted the Xbox division will likely lose over $1B in 2013, after factoring expenses such as marketing and R&D.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Devices & Studios product chief Julie Larson-Green during a recent UBS conference talk: ""We have the Windows Phone OS. We have Windows RT and we have full Windows. We're not going to have three.""
Though not overtly stating it, Larson-Green hints Windows RT, which has been virtually abandoned by OEM partners, will get the hook. She admits RT lacks the flexibility of traditional Windows (albeit while suggesting it's more mobile-optimized), and that Microsoft didn't do a sufficient job of differentiating its Surface RT and Surface Pro tablets.
Mary-Jo Foley previously reported Microsoft is thinking of merging Windows Phone and RT. She now says (citing a source) ""it's more likely that the Windows Phone OS core is what Microsoft will use as the starting point"" for its merged OS, rather than RT.
Meanwhile, Nomura's Rick Sherlund is making a fresh case for unloading the Xbox unit (previous): He thinks the business will likely lose over $1B this year, and simply isn't enough to ""cement Microsoft’s position in the consumer market,"" given the popularity of mobile media consumption.
A big issue: Mobile's volumes have come to dwarf the console market's. While Sherlund thinks Microsoft might sell 3M-4M Xbox One units in 2013, and Sony is aiming for 5M PS4 sales by the end of March, IDC thinks Q3 smartphone and tablet shipments respectively totaled 261.1M and 47.6M.

""The Xbox One feels like it's from the future,"" says Polygon, which likes the console's TV integration, SmartGlass tablet apps, universal remote support, and Xbox Live options. But it also states the next-gen Kinect ""isn't a fully realized product yet,"" and that the One's design ""lacks the profile and space-saving considerations of the PlayStation 4 — or even the original Xbox 360.""

The Verge (7.8/10) likes the One's launch titles, and is impressed with the ability of Kinect voice commands to enhance gameplay. At the same time, it criticizes the Kinect's reliability, as well as issues with audio/video quality when passing signals from other devices.

""At the end of the day, we need to break a pattern. Face it, I'm a pattern,"" says Steve Ballmer (NASDAQ:MSFT) during a WSJ interview regarding his decision to step down as Microsoft's CEO. ""Maybe I'm an emblem of an old era ... the best way for Microsoft to enter a new era is a new leader who will accelerate change.""
Both Ballmer and lead independent director John Thompson insist the oft-criticized Microsoft chief wasn't pushed out, but Thompson also says the board was ""pushing [Ballmer] damn hard to go faster.""
Even before announcing his planned departure, Ballmer was overhauling his management style in response to pressure, meeting with lieutenants in groups (as opposed to one-on-one) and calling for shorter and more frequent reports in an effort to increase collaboration.
The interview also provides more reason to think Alan Mulally is a top candidate to succeed Ballmer: Ballmer says a 4-hour talk with Mulally last Christmas Eve in which the Ford CEO stressed the importance of teamwork and brand simplification in remaking Ford acted as a wake-up call.

Analyst Michael Purcell gushes with praise for the professional social network, declaring it's ""evolving into a critical daily or weekly platform for professional workers of all types,"" and will ""remain pivotal in the increasingly complex forces of global business expansion and labor.""
Sell-side commentary on LinkedIn has been quite bullish lately. ITG Research recently reported LinkedIn's Q4 was tracking above consensus, and Needham has reiterated a Buy and $280 PT following an upbeat investor meeting with CFO Steve Sordello.
Among other things, Needham is upbeat about LinkedIn's Sales Navigator social selling tool (just beginning to ramp), and notes management sees many HR opportunities, including training and performance management.
Needham: ""The holy grail is to recruit, train and measure the effectiveness of employees all through one platform."" Such an offering could put LinkedIn into competition with a variety of cloud HR software firms, such as Workday, Ultimate Software, and Cornerstone OnDemand.

1320,Tech giants feel impact of U.S. spying scandal,"
 Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) FQ1 results earlier this week highlight how major tech firms are feeling the impact of a backlash in China to Edward Snowden's revelations about U.S. spying. ""All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,"" says Jim Lewis, a China and technology expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. Cisco has been the most explicit about attributing the Snowden effect to its falling sales in China; Beijing could be specifically targeting the company due to American hostility to telecom-equipment makers Huawei Technologies and ZTE  (OTCPK:ZTCOY) over fears that their products could be used for espionage. However, Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) experience is that the ""The Snowden effect is not real,"" adding that business in China continues to grow. Other companies to suffer in the country recently include IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the reasons cited including macro-economic factors. IBM might be somewhat inured to the NSA affair, as some of its high-end products face less competition than Cisco's offerings.  ",2013-11-15

1323,Microsoft axes criticized employee ranking system,"

Microsoft's (MSFT -0.6%) ""stack ranking"" system, which forced managers to rank a certain percentage of employees as top, average, and poor performers, is being discarded. Former Microsoft workers have criticized the system for creating a work environment in which good employees occasionally received bad reviews, and in which workers felt as if they were competing with each other.
In an internal memo discussing the change, HR chief Lisa Brummel says Microsoft will now place a greater emphasis on ""teamwork and collaboration"" when reviewing employee performance, and will no longer have a ""a pre-determined targeted distribution"" for determining employee rewards.
The policy changes comes a few months after a reorg meant to foster greater collaboration between business units, and near the tail end of the Steve Ballmer era.
Interestingly, Microsoft is abandoning stack ranking just as Marissa Mayer gets criticized for implementing something similar at Yahoo.

Stephen Elop, reportedly on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO shortlists, would consider unloading the software giant's Bing and Xbox ops if given the top job, sources tell Bloomberg.
At the same time, Elop would make a larger priority of bringing Office to third-party mobile platforms. Microsoft has launched Office iPhone and Android apps (they require an Office 365 subscription), but has held off on launching iPad apps, and has said it won't do so until it develops a more touch-friendly UI for the cash-cow productivity suite.
If Elop (or a different Steve Ballmer replacement) decides to abandon Bing and Xbox, he might get plenty of support for the move. In his recent bullish note, Nomura's Rick Sherlund argued ditching the businesses, along with other moves, could boost FY15 EPS by 40%. Co-founder Paul Allen also wants Xbox and Bing to be unloaded.
Bing headlines an online services business that has lost billions in recent years, and the former Xbox unit (Entertainment & Devices) frequently alternated between making and losing money.
Bloomberg's report comes as Microsoft updates its free Office Web apps to support real-time collaboration, a feature that has long been a major selling point for Google Apps. Microsoft is also making Yammer's business social networking platform free to all enterprise Office 365 users; that could make life tougher for Yammer rival JIVE.

 Aided by strong sales of the low-end Lumia 520, Windows Phone's (NASDAQ:MSFT) smartphone share in the EU5 rose to 9.8% in the July-September timeframe, per Kantar Worldpanel's latest estimates.That's up from 9.2% in the June-August timeframe, and just 4.6% a year ago. Moreover, Microsoft's OS now claims a double-digit share of U.K., French, and Italian smartphone sales. Elsewhere, progress is slower. Kantar estimates WP still only has a 4.6% share in the U.S. (+190 bps Y/Y), a 2.5% share in China, and a 5.8% share in Latin America. Nokia's most recent Lumia launches could provide a lift. In what has been a general trend this year, the iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) picked up share in the U.S. (+130 bps to 35.9%), and lost share in the EU5 (-230 bps to 14.6%). Also, the iPhone's Chinese share is believed to have fallen 640 bps Y/Y to 13.8%, and its Latin American share is believed to have risen 220 bps to 6.6%. Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) is assigned a U.S. share of 57.3%, an EU5 share of 71.9% (+420 bps), a Chinese share of 81.1% (+1460 bps), and a Latin American share of 73.4% (+2310 bps, largely at BlackBerry/Symbian's expense). Kantar makes note of the price-sensitivity of Chinese consumers, observing some spend 70% of their monthly income to buy a new smartphone. That, in turn, leads many of them to opt for hardware from local brands who are increasingly offering Android phones with high-end specs and mid-range prices.  ",2013-11-4

Microsoft's promotional efforts are said to include providing $25 Windows Store gift cards with touch hardware purchases, and working with retailers to create ""uncluttered and welcoming Windows centers.""
The software giant is also reportedly aiming for 16M holiday season Windows tablet sales. For reference, IDC estimates industry-wide tablet shipments totaled 52.5M in Q4 2012; the 2013 figure will probably be above 70M.
Thurrott's report comes as Net Applications estimates Windows 8/8.1's share of the global PC base rose only 0.36% in October to 9.25%. 46.4% of PCs are believed to be running Windows 7 (up fractionally), which is widely preferred by enterprises, and 31.2% are still running Windows XP, which Microsoft (in an effort to get businesses to upgrade to Win. 7) will end support for next year.

Though Nomura's Rick Sherlund (Buy, $40 PT) is willing to give Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ""the benefit of the doubt"" for its targets of 50M Windows Phone sales and $600M/year in cost savings for Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) phone unit in FY15 (ends June '15), he nonetheless sees the division diluting Microsoft's FY14 EPS by $0.08, and its FY15 EPS by $0.06.
The reason? Sherlund expects the Nokia unit's feature phone sales, already nosediving, to drop 32% in FY14 to $6.8B, and 29% in FY15 to $4.9B. That more than offsets an expected 43% increase in smartphone sales (now entirely Windows Phone) from FY13 to FY15, to $8.4B. Thus, in spite of cost cuts, Sherlund sees the business posting a $630M FY15 op. loss, and a -5% op. margin.
The Nokia unit is coming off a quarter where it posted a $47M op. loss, a -1.6% op. margin, and a 19% Y/Y drop in revenue to €2.9B ($3.9B). Windows Phone (Lumia) volumes jumped to 8.8M units from 7.4M and 2.9M a year earlier, but their were sold at an ASP of just €143 ($194, -8% Q/Q), thanks to a mix shift towards sales of Lumia 520 and other cheaper models.
Nokia's feature phone units totaled 55.8M, +4% Q/Q and -27% Y/Y. The devices were sold at an ASP of just €27 ($37), +4% Q/Q and -13% Y/Y.

Though using P/Es to value growth-stage tech firms can be tricky, given how near-term earnings are often depressed by big investments, a look at price/sales multiples makes it clear valuations for many high-growth names have soared.

 ""We believe that Google's (GOOG +12.8%) ability to monetize experiences through engagement-based services will allow it to disrupt many hardware and software layers over time,"" writes Evercore's Ken Sena, exemplifying the glowing analyst commentary that has followed Google's Q3 beat. Sena, who is raising his PT to $1,100, sees Google's services investments pressuring near-term margins, but also creating ""a stronger platform ecosystem in which more collected data, better predictive analytics, and an increased amount of screen connectivity will lead to better overall search economics in addition to new opportunities."" 
Needham and Jefferies have raised their PTs to $1,150, and Deutsche has raised its target to $1,220. YouTube's mobile growth, strong paid click volumes, and the potential for Enhanced Campaigns to lift search ad sales (after doing less damage than expected in Q3) are all mentioned as reasons to stay bullish. U.S. Internet peers continue to rally in sympathy: FB +4.1%. LNKD +3.7%. YELP +7.8%. AMZN +3.3%. Z +3.9%. TRLA +4.8%. ZNGA +2.8%. Foreign Internet names are also moving higher: BIDU +5%. YOKU +6.9%.

1349,More on Microsoft: Major Windows release could arrive in 2015,"

The plugged-in Mary Jo Foley reports Microsoft (MSFT +0.7%) is thinking of releasing its next major Windows update (Win. 8 qualifies as one, 8.1 doesn't) in the spring of 2015, and that the OS will bring Windows and Windows Phone ""closer together.""
Foley adds Microsoft is thinking of merging Windows Phone and the struggling Windows RT (both are ARM-based) by 2015; if a recent report about Windows Phone being updated to support 7""-10"" displays pans out, the integration effort could take the form of phasing out RT in favor of Windows Phone.
Also: Microsoft's new OS division, led by former Windows Phone chief Terry Myerson and created by the reorg, is said to be ""rethinking priorities, workflow and just about everything else"" related to Microsoft's disparate operating systems. Following the reorg, Microsoft overhauled its Windows teams to further tie together PC, mobile, and Xbox development.

1350,Windows 8.1 receives good (but qualified) reviews; cheaper hardware arrives,"

Windows 8.1 (MSFT +0.6%) is a clear improvement over Windows 8, but doesn't completely address the complaints users have registered over the latter's UI. That seems to be the consensus for reviews of the latest version of Microsoft's PC OS, available starting today as a free upgrade to Win. 8 users.

The Verge (8.8/10) declares every built-in Windows app ""has been improved,"" and is also fond of 8.1's personalization options, snap view features, and universal search support. But it still finds it ""awkward"" to navigate Microsoft's Metro UI with a keyboard and mouse.

Wired: ""Should you upgrade? Yes. It’s a solid update. The people who hated Windows 8, however, likely aren’t going to be much more pleased with 8.1."" PC World: ""Windows 8.1 eases the transition for desktop diehards, granting PC enthusiasts the ability to shun most of the tablet-oriented bits.""
There should be a decent number of reasonably-priced 8.1 tablets/convertibles this holiday season, thanks in part to Microsoft's license discounts for smaller devices. Two examples: Lenovo's $299 Miix and Acer's $330-$380 Iconia W4. Both products have 8"" displays and Intel Bay Trail Atom CPUs.

""We think the stage is set for a series of value creating events to unfold over the next 18 months,"" says analyst Ross MacMIllan, upgrading Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Buy and lifting his price target to $42 from $33.
Among those events is a new operating structure with greater transparency on the best assets, or what MacMillan calls ""BestCo"" - the commercial segment containing key assets transitioning to the cloud. ""OtherCo"" is the devices and consumer segment which carry less clear value. MacMillan sees the market allowing a higher valuation to the BestCo operations.
As for the new CEO, MacMillan sees the potential for better portfolio focus - i.e. which assets should remain as core and what should be viewed as non-core - as well as someone who sees the company's massive recurring cash flows as opportunity to give more back to shareholders.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has rolled out GDR3, a Windows Phone update that adds support for larger (5""+) and higher-resolution (1080p) displays, quad-core CPUs (inc. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800), improved Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity, and support for more home page live tiles.
The update is a big one both because Android has supported larger displays, 1080p, and quad-core for a while, and because it comes ahead of an Oct. 22 Nokia event expected to feature the launch of at least two new Lumia phones, including a 6"" phablet.
Meanwhile, WP ad network AdDuplex's October data indicates the low-end Lumia 520 ($129 off-contract at Wal-Mart) now makes up 32.8% of WP8 devices tracked by its network. The Lumia 920 (high-end) and 620 (mid-range) make up 12.9% apiece, and the Lumia 820 and 720 are each a little below 8%.
Also: Nokia is partnering with Netflix to offer 6-12 months of free streaming to U.K. Lumia buyers, and (per the FT) is planning a big holiday season marketing push with Microsoft and U.K. carriers/retailers to promote Windows Phone. Nokia is reportedly bearing the brunt of the cost for at least one of the Netflix offers.

As it searches for Steve Ballmer's replacement, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) board is divided over whether the person should be a tech visionary/expert or a seasoned exec skilled at running a large organization, the WSJ reports.
At least eight outsiders and two internal candidates have reportedly been approached, including Alan Mulally, Stephen Elop, Oracle president/ex-H-P CEO Mark Hurd (said to be uninterested), Infor CEO Charles Phillips, server/cloud chief Satya Nadella, and Skype chief Tony Bates.
If it's any comfort to the board, pundits appear just as divided on which direction Microsoft should go, as evidenced by the reactions to a report Mulally is the frontrunner to be Microsoft's next CEO.

While the number isn't pretty, it's notably better than the 11.4% drop IDC estimated for Q2, as well as the firm's respective Q3 and full-year forecasts of -9.5% and -9.7%. Easier comps helped out a bit (shipments fell 8.6% Y/Y a year ago), as did ""channel intake of Windows 8.1-based systems"" in September. (PR)
As was the case in Q2, U.S. and enterprise were areas of strength. U.S. shipments only fell 0.2%, and enterprise volumes saw a ""slight uptick."" But tablet cannibalization led Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) shipments to fall 8.8%. EMEA declined in-line with expectations, while Japan outperformed.
The mix shift is a positive for H-P (HPQ - 27% U.S. share vs. 17.1% global share), Intel (INTC - higher ASPs), and Microsoft (MSFT - higher ASPs and less piracy). It hurts Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), but the Chinese firm was still the market's top vendor, and saw its global share rise 160 bps Y/Y to 17.3%.
H-P was #2; its share rose 130 bps. #3 Dell, which has gotten more aggressive with its pricing, saw its share rise 90 bps to 11.7%.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) U.S. PC share, which has been rising in recent years, fell 140 bps to 11.6%; the enterprise mix shift and pending MacBook Pro/Mac OS X refreshes likely played roles.

Holding court at a Gartner symposium, Steve Ballmer (MSFT -1.1%) stated Microsoft will launch Office iPad apps once it develops a ""touch-first"" UI for the productivity suite. For now, Office is only available on the iPad and Android tablets via the Office Web Apps.
The comment follows September remarks from exec Qi Liu indicating an upcoming touch-friendly version of Office (codenamed Gemini) will be available on rival platforms. A roadmap leaked in April suggested Gemini won't arrive until fall 2014.
Microsoft rolled out Office apps for iOS/Android phones earlier this year. The apps require Office 365 subscriptions, and it's a good bet the same will hold for the iPad apps. Apple just made its iWork productivity suite free to buyers of new iOS devices, and Google has made its Quickoffice suite free to all Android users.

1358,"Microsoft unveils fall enterprise/cloud roadmap, offers Azure discounts","

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cloud & Enterprise chief Satya Nadella has unveiled the software giant's fall roadmap for the businesses that (before the reorg) made up its Server & Tools unit. Not surprisingly, cloud services are showcased early and often.
Among the products launching this fall: New versions of Microsoft's Dynamics CRM and supply-chain software; refreshes for the Visual Studio and .NET software development platforms; updates to Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012; a version of Windows Azure meant for government clients; and a service launched in partnership with Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) that allows users of Equinix's data centers to directly connect to Azure.
Like peers, Microsoft is giving priority to big data/analytics features. The company promises its SQL Server 2014 database will offer big improvements in transaction processing speed, so as to better compete with in-memory databases from SAP and Oracle. it's also launching an Azure service based on the Hadoop big data framework for integrating cloud data into visualizations.
Meanwhile, Azure discounts are being provided for enterprise volume license customers, as Microsoft continues squaring off against Amazon,VMware, and others in a cloud infrastructure market seeing intense price competition. Nadella asserts Microsoft's enterprise software lineup gives Azure an edge over rivals in enabling hybrid clouds.
Server & Tools had an $8.2B FY13 op. profit, +13% Y/Y. That was still well below the $16.2B reported for the Office division (+2%), but close to the $9.5B reported for the Windows division (-18%, hurt by PC weakness and a $900M Surface RT write-down).

Bloomberg reports Microsoft (MSFT +0.3%) is talking to struggling HTC (OTC:HTCKF) about adding Windows Phone support to the OEM's Android hardware ""at little or no cost."" It isn't clear whether the phones would simultaneously run Android and Windows Phone, or simply give users the option of choosing one of the two.
In addition, the news service reports Steve Ballmer met with other OEMs last week during a Chinese trip to drum up Windows Phone support. The report suggests Microsoft is intent on maintaining 3rd-party hardware support for WP (Q2 smartphone share of just 3.7%, per IDC) in the wake of the Nokia deal; not everyone is convinced they'll be able to.
Though his tenure as CEO is coming to an end, Ballmer is standing for re-election to Microsoft's board. So is (unsurprisingly) Bill Gates, whom certain top investors reportedly want out.
Microsoft says its new Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets are close to selling out. Of course, the first-gen Surface models also saw sell-outs following their launches.

There have already been multiple reports of a Google smartwatch project being underway, but product details have been limited.

""We believe back to school PC demand has been virtually absent,"" says Sterne Agee's Vijay Rakesh in a critical note on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Moreover, Sterne thinks high inventories and weak demand are pointing to the absence of a holiday season sales boost (normally 5%-7%) as well.
Rakesh now sees PC sales falling 10.7% Y/Y in Q4, worse than a prior forecast for a 9.6% drop. He also questions the ability of smartphone/tablet CPU sales to offset declining PC CPU sales for Intel, given notebook processors typically sell for several times as much as their mobile counterparts. Oddly enough (given Nokia's limited smartphone share), Rakesh also suggests the Microsoft-Nokia deal is a negative for the chip giant.
In August, IDC lowered its 2013 PC shipment growth forecast to -9.7% from a prior -7.8%. The firm estimates PC shipments fell 11.4% Y/Y in Q2 (Gartner is at 10.9%), and has predicted tablet shipments (aided by seasonality) will exceed PC shipments in Q4.

However, the government's decision should open the door for console makers and game developers (EA, ATVI, TTWO) to formally market their wares, replete with Chinese-language translations.

With the newly-launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 sporting 10.6"" displays, Microsoft still needs a smaller tablet to address a booming market for sub-8"" tablets (where Android rules the roost). But is opting for Windows RT over standard Windows a smart move in light of this year's events?
Dell just stopped selling its XPS 10 RT tablet. As BI observes, that leaves Microsoft the only RT tablet maker for now.

Microsoft (MSFT -0.9%), AOL, and Yahoo (YHOO +3.3%) have established APIs for an ad partnership formed in 2011, meant to enable the sharing of the companies' display ad inventory and the integration of their real-time (programmatic) bidding platforms.
The APIs allow advertisers to more quickly/easily make programmatic bids that cover all three companies' ad networks. Microsoft, AOL, and Yahoo are hoping other publishers and ad tech firms will support the API. The companies' end game: to create a stronger rival to Google's (GOOG) DoubleClick by pooling resources.
Google, whose display ad ops have been growing rapidly, rolled out new programmatic ad deal types for DoubleClick in April. eMarketer estimates the U.S. programmatic market, which AOL is betting big on, will grow 73% in 2013 to $3.36B, and total $8.49B (29% of display ad spend) in 2017. Recent IPO Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL) provides a programmatic ad-buying platform (backed by AI-based algorithms).
Microsoft is forming a 49:51 Chinese game console JV with local firm BesTV, a move that allows it to officially enter a market where the Xbox is banned. Unofficially, the Xbox is easy to find on the black market, with users typically buying modified versions that support pirated games.
The JV will be based in Shanghai's new free-trade zone, where the Chinese government reportedly plans to allow access to Facebook, Twitter, and other sites currently blocked in the country. Will Google/YouTube also see an opening?

The Surface Pro 2, which is more of a PC/tablet convertible than a standard tablet, starts at $899.

Pricing for a commercial version of Glass remains a mystery. The developer edition was sold earlier this year for $1,500. Google has said it doesn't plan to run ads on Glass, and wants to profit from hardware sales.

However, citing customer ""feedback,"" Microsoft is providing a ""full version"" of Windows this time around, and not requiring that buyers have an older version installed.

Sources tell the WSJ  BlackBerry (BBRY +5.9%) is "" aiming to run a fast auction process that could be wrapped up by November."" The report led shares to spike just before the close. Meanwhile, sources tell Bloomberg Microsoft (MSFT -2.2%) is ""keeping an eye"" on BlackBerry in the wake of the Nokia deal.

Xbox exec Yusuf Mehdi says most of Microsoft's pre-order supply has been sold out (an incremental positive for CPU/GPU supplier AMD). Early pre-order demand was hurt by game resale/Internet verification policies Microsoft decided to backtrack on. Sony announced last month PS4 pre-orders have topped 1M.
The One, which is bundled with a new Kinect and is being pitched as a comprehensive home entertainment platform, will cost $100 more than the PS4, which has a stronger gaming focus. Eurogamer just reported Sony is working on a virtual reality headset for the PS4 that's set to launch in 2014.

A Steve Ballmer e-mail and a company presentation go over Microsoft's (MSFT -6%) plans for Nokia's (NOK +31.3%) phone unit.
Stephen Elop, now more than ever viewed as a possible Ballmer replacement, will head an ""expanded Devices team"" that will include ""all of [Microsoft's] current Devices and Studios work and most of the teams coming over from Nokia.
Julie Larson-Green, who was recently put in charge of Devices & Studios' engineering and content work, will join Elop's team once the deal closes.
Key Nokia engineering/design execs will report to Elop. But Nokia's sales team, led by Chris Weber, will ultimately report to COO Kevin Turner. Also, ""all global marketing"" will be run by Microsoft's Tami Reller and Mark Penn. There are ""no major plans"" to move Nokia teams to different geographies.
Microsoft predicts the purchase will hurt FY14 EPS by $0.08, be neutral to FY15 EPS, and accretive to FY16 EPS by $0.08. Much, of course, depends on how future hardware launches are received.
Microsoft is acquiring 8.5K Nokia design patents. Nokia's 30K utility patents/applications are being licensed. Elop insists Microsoft isn't abandoning Nokia's declining feature phone ops, calling them ""an on-ramp to Windows Phone.""
Like others on the Street, Deutsche is unconvinced about the deal's merits. ""We do not see this deal offering anything incremental to MSFT that it did not have as part of its partnership with NOK.""

Ben Thompson: ""Today no one cares about Nokia’s industrial design, distribution, or supply chain, because their devices lack an app ecosystem, the price of entry into smartphones ... I theorize that Nokia was either going to switch to Android or was on the verge of going bankrupt.""

 Nokia (NYSE:NOK) shares jump 37% in Helsinki following news that it's selling its mobile phone unit to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as part of a deal worth $7.17B. SA author Charles Fox reckons a major motive behind the transaction is that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is now a dead certainty to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft boss. Shorn of a big loss maker and sitting on a nice cash mountain, the future seems bright for Nokia, although its potential could now be limited. Some might think that Microsoft is overpaying for a business ""many investors and analysts wrote off as dead,"" but Fox thinks $5B ""seems like chump change for a...division that once ruled the phone market"" and could come back. Jacob Steinberg echoes these sentiments. ""Nokia's phone business deserves a much better price than $5B considering how it generated $20.38B in revenues last year,"" says Steinberg.  ",2013-09-3
1411,More on Microsoft/Nokia,"

Nokia (NYSE:NOK) had a market cap of $14.5B as of Friday's close. Thus, unless investors think Nokia's assets outside of Devices & Services (they include $3B+ in net cash and an IP portfolio that's now more valuable) are worth $7.3B or less, shares will trade higher on Tuesday.
Investors are likely to now look much more favorably on Nokia's financial health, both due to the Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) cash infusion and the fact the company is shedding a business it has been struggling to turn a profit on (and which also has significant liabilities). Look for some of the ratings agencies who have downgraded Nokia in recent years to issue upgrades going forward.
Microsoft is both making good on its promise to evolve into a ""devices & services"" company, and taking an enormous gamble on increasing its consumer exposure at a time when enterprise-related sales have come to account for the lion's share of its op. profit.
Nokia's Devices & Services unit posted a €703M op. loss (non-IFRS) in 2012, and a €32M op. loss in Q2. And while its Lumia sales rose to $1.16B in Q2 on the back of 7.4M units, feature phone sales fell 39% Y/Y to $1.41B thanks to soaring demand for cheap Android phones. Will Microsoft attempt to unload Nokia's feature phone ops, and if so, what kind of deal will it get?
Also of concern: 1) Windows Phone, though faring well in some markets, only had a 3.7% smartphone unit share in Q2 (per IDC), and a large portion of its growth appears to be coming from feature phone converts. 2) WP licensees such as Samsung, LG, and Huawei, whose support for the OS has been limited relative to their support for Android, may not be thrilled that their WP models will be directly competing against Microsoft. As it is, the Lumia line accounts for an overwhelming share of the WP8 installed base.
It's the end of an era: Nokia towered over the mobile phone industry for years, and had a 37% unit share in Q2 2007 (just before the iPhone's arrival).
In what might amount to a goodwill gesture, Microsoft says it will invest $250M+ to build a Finnish data center that will serve European Microsoft consumers.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is paying €3.79B for Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) Devices & Services ops, and €1.65B to obtain a 10-year non-exclusive license to Nokia's patents. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2014.
32K Nokia workers will be joining Microsoft. Stephen Elop and other senior Nokia execs (Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber) are expected to be among them. Elop has already been viewed by many as a top candidate to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's CEO.
Elop is resigning as Nokia's CEO, and from the company's board, to avoid signs of conflicts of interest. He's now head of Devices & Services. Chairman Risto Siilasmaa has been named interim CEO.
Microsoft is also licensing Nokia's Here mapping platform, and providing Nokia with €1.5B in new financing. Nokia  will now focus its efforts on NSN (telecom equipment), Here, and IP  licensing; with no phones to obtain licenses for, Nokia now has more  leverage in patent negotiations.
Nokia will ""maintain and own"" the Nokia brand. Microsoft has obtained a license to use the Nokia brand with Series 30 and Series 40 phones, but apparently not Lumia phones (which presumably will be Microsoft-branded). Nokia won't be able to use its brand ""on Nokia's own mobile devices"" until the end of 2015.
Nokia will hold a shareholder's meeting on Nov. 19 to vote on the sale. The company expects the deal to be ""significantly accretive to earnings."" The deal has a $750M termination fee.

The tempest of public attention escalated yesterday, after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government will pay $278M during the fiscal year to telecommunications firms for clandestine access to their networks.

Worldwide PC shipments are expected to fall 9.7% in 2013, according to IDC. Today's figure represents the second time the research firm has slashed its projection, from -7.8% in May, and from an original -1.3% back in March.

The cloud migration continues: 46% of respondents said their companies are using cloud/SaaS apps, up from a prior 38%. Not surprisingly, companies are more comfortable moving CRM and HR apps to the cloud (Salesforce and WDAY have led the way) than moving ERP apps (SAP's stronghold in the on-premise world).
Also, 60% said their firms are using or considering a cloud app platform such as Salesforce's Heroku and Force.com vs. a prior 52%, and 48% said the same for cloud infrastructure platforms such as AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) vs. a prior 41%. Windows Azure competes in both realms.
Interestingly, in spite of the rapid growth SAP has seen for Hana, only 13% of respondents said their firms are using an in-memory database. Another 37% are considering, and 50% are unlikely to consider it.

1433,Nokia tablet specs reportedly leak; Google blocks YouTube WP app,"

Microsoft-news.com has leaked what it claims are specs for an upcoming Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Windows RT 8.1 (NASDAQ:MSFT) tablet.
The device is said to have a 10.1"" 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 CPU, 32GB of storage, and a detachable keyboard/stand. A Sep. launch is ""rumored.""
""Don't do it, Nokia,"" BGR's Brad Reed advises. Windows RT hardware sales have been ugly, and one major OEM after another has turned its back on the ARM-powered OS, which can't run apps created for Intel/AMD-powered systems. Moreover, companies not named Apple have generally had a rough time selling ~$500 tablets.
The Verge reported in July Nokia was working on an RT tablet earlier this year, but cancelled the project to work on a cheap Win. 8 tablet.
Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has blocked a YouTube Windows Phone app built by Microsoft (no Google-made app exists), citing TOU violations. Redmond isn't amused, and has fired off a harsh missive titled ""The limits of Google's openness.""

In the past, Google has justified its lack of WP app development by saying it ""will go where the users are."" It's also possible Google doesn't want users to go to a rival mobile platform that has Bing as its default search engine.

Greenlight Capital's latest 13F indicates David Einhorn dumped his 6.1M-share Microsoft (MSFT -1.8%) stake, and his 5.4M-share Seagate (STX -3.4%) stake, in Q2.
Einhorn also took some profits in Marvell (MRVL -1.3%), paring his position to 44.3M shares from 51.8M shares at the end of Q1. But that still leaves him with a ~9% stake in the chipmaker, which has been on a tear this year.

Microsoft (MSFT -1%) announces Windows 8.1 downloads will be available on Oct. 17, and that the OS will see a full retail launch the next day. OEMs are expected to receive the Release to Manufacturing (RTM) build in the coming weeks.
8.1 is meant to address many of the complaints Win. 7 devotees have registered about Win. 8's UI changes. Among other things, 8.1 brings back the Start button (but not the full Start menu), provides quick access to a full app list and a power users' menu, and offers an image-rich view that combines local and Bing results.
App updates, new tile sizes, more personalization options, a boot-to-desktop option, and better keyboard/mouse navigation and settings controls are also part of the package.
A recently-leaked RTM test build indicates Microsoft recently made a few more tweaks to address Win. 8-related complaints. Context menu controls have been changed to make features easier to find, and swiping tips have been built into apps.
Given how both PC sales and Microsoft's Windows revenue are trending, the company badly needs a positive consumer response.

Among those positions cut, the most significant  moves are: AIG, AAPL, BYD, DLPH, CIM, GM (cashed in almost all warrants), LCC, MSFT, and WFT.

IDC estimates Windows Phone (NASDAQ:MSFT) only had a 3.7% global smartphone shipment share in Q2 on the back of 8.7M shipments (vs. 31.2M for the iPhone and 187.4M for Android).
But in spite of that figure (weighed down by low U.S. and Chinese shares), there are a handful of big markets where WP is faring notably better. As SA contributor Chandan Sarkar recently observed, Kantar estimates the OS' share has passed 8% in the U.K. and France, and (though falling) is still around 8% in Italy.
In May, Microsoft exec Terry Myerson claimed WP's share had hit 20% in Poland and Mexico. IDC puts its Polish and Mexican shares at 16% and 7%.
This week, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) exec Jo Harlow claimed Nokia's smartphone share had topped 20% in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. If true, the Lumia 520 is likely responsible for a big chunk of those gains.
The numbers arrive at a time when reviewers frequently praise the hardware craftsmanship that goes into high-end Lumia models, but also argue Windows Phone - due to missing/inferior apps and features - is holding them back.

Evercore's Kirk Materne, who upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Overweight today, thinks the company's Office and Server & Tools divisions are worth a combined $24-$26/share by themselves.
His estimate assigns a P/E of 11-12 to the businesses on 2014E EPS of ~$2.15, factors in a gross margin hit from the shift to cloud services, and is said to include ""fairly conservative assumptions"" for consumer Office division revenue (~15% of total).
After throwing in $6/share in net cash (30% tax rate assigned to offshore cash), Materne considers downside risk to be ""fairly low"" for Microsoft in spite of its well-publicized Windows woes. Particularly since Office/S&T revenue streams have largely shifted to subscriptions/annual licenses, and FY13 billings for the divisions respectively rose by 3% and 9% in the face of soft server and consumer PC sales.

 U.S. cloud-computing companies could miss out on $21.5-35B of revenues over the next three years because of concerns about how U.S. authorities such as the National Security Agency have been accessing the firms' user data. The estimate comes from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation think tank.
Companies that could be affected include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There's increasing evidence that non-U.S. firms have been canceling orders and limiting their use of U.S. cloud service providers. In a membership survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, 10% of non-U.S. respondents said they had ended a project with a U.S. cloud company, while over half said they would be less likely to use one.

6 weeks after launching Office Mobile on the iPhone, Microsoft (MSFT +0.6%) has brought the trimmed-down, touch-optimized version of its flagship productivity suite to Android.
Like their iPhone counterparts, the Android apps require an Office 365 subscription (they're free for those who have one). There's still no tablet support - Microsoft continues to promote the Office Web Apps for tablets.
Reviews for the iPhone apps (I, II, III) were muted. The apps receive praise for their minimalist design and offline/SkyDrive support, but are criticized for failing to work well with 3rd-party apps, and for missing desired formatting/editing features.

Microsoft is promising it will do a better job of supporting iOS/Android. Hardware chief Julie Larson-Green: ""We can provide unique, differentiated experiences on our devices and on other people’s devices.""
The Android app launch comes as ex-Facebook CTO Bret Taylor unveils Quip, a mobile-optimized word processor that (like Google Apps) emphasizes collaborative editing and is receiving positive early buzz.
