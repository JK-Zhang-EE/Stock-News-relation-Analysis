""It���s important to bear in mind that the cost of the car is made up of about 10,000 unique parts and processes. depending on how you count it, the current cost of a standard range Model 3 would be around $38,000, so each part or process step only costs around $3.80.

 Bond Angle's Vicki Bryan is out with 2019 projections on Tesla (TSLA +1.5%). The analyst expects Tesla's revenue to be up 31% Y/Y to $27.16B vs. $29.1B consensus and EBITDA growth of 72% to $3.43B. A gross margin rate of 22.8% is seen for the year vs. the 19.3% (est.) margin rate for 2018. Bryan's 2019 outlook: ""Tesla should be able to offset some, though not all, pricing and mix erosion via slowly improving operating efficiency sufficient to generate better visibility into sales and profit trends, as well as increasingly reliable cash generating capacity. That said, Tesla may continue to struggle to generate significant cash flow to fund increasing capex it needs for its burgeoning project load (I estimated at least $3 billion in capex for 2019) plus $1.7 billion due in maturing debt and possibly several hundred million in legal settlements.""

306,Tesla stars during Oracle analyst meeting,"
 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 2.1% on the day amid a broad market downturn. There's some speculation that off-script comments from Oracle (ORCL -1.1%)��Co-founder and CTO��Larry Ellison during the company's analyst meeting late yesterday could be a factor. Ellison defended his ""close friend"" Elon Musk for landing rockets on robot drone rafts, while implying that his critics banging on their Apple Macintosh computers don't quite get it. Ellison also drew a comparison between Oracle and its autonomous data revenue with Tesla and its mass-market EV program.The billionaire also disclosed that Tesla is his second-largest investment.

307,"With Tesla up 10%, analysts dig in","
 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 10.3%��premarket after posting Q3 numbers ahead of estimates. While there's a whole bunch of analysts buzzing about the EV stock, it appears that Wolfe Research (Outperform rating from Peer Perform) may be the only firm to have switched its rating after taking in the earnings report and relatively uneventful conference call. Here's a smattering of what the analysts are saying today about the Palo Alto automaker. Baird (Buy): ""TSLA reported a Model 3 gross margin of 20%, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Management indicated it believes TSLA can be sustainably profitable and cash flow positive moving forward, which we think could help flip the narrative. We expect shares to trade higher following the blow-out quarter and remain buyers."" Morgan Stanley (Buy): ""The quality of cash flow was stronger than expected with working capital not benefiting as much as we had anticipated."" Goldman Sachs (Sell): 'We question if this is not as good as it gets from a near-term upside surprise for shares. The company has maintained that it designed and built the Model 3 with a target 25% gross margin and almost achieved that this quarter (albeit with a rich mix). However, with its own exposure to China tariffs on imported components and likely headwinds to mix as lower price point vehicles are offered, automotive gross margins likely compress sequentially into 4Q18 ��� and could see further mix pressure into 2019 as the US Federal Tax Credit begins to phase out for its vehicles."" JPMorgan (Sell, price target lifted to $225): ""We remain Underweight, both on valuation and concern the new stronger trajectory to earnings and cash may prove less sustainable than the market is likely to presume, including given several headwinds.""Jefferies: ""Assuming R&D spending is not delayed and Tesla is not forced to introduce a lower price (Model 3) prematurely to maintain volume, Tesla could be self-funded. The Tesla investment case is about growth, not free cash generation, so we expect cash to be invested in growth and support current leverage if Tesla demonstrates sustainably positive free cash flow.""

Musk says in the short term the Model 3s will be built in California, but in the long term local production out of Europe will make sense. Musk has been decidedly more hesitant about throwing out high-flying production targets as he has in the past.7:00 p.m. - Chief Technical Officer J.B.

Musk sees the company being cash flow flat in Q1 and expects profitability through 2019.6:25 p.m. - Before Tesla execs get on the call it's worth noting that several automakers are pushing higher in AH trading alongside Tesla.

 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) says it had free cash flow of $881M supported by operating cash flow of $1.4B during Q3. GAAP net income was $312M and non-GAAP net income arrived in at $516M. The company says it delivered 56,065 Model 3 vehicles to customers during the quarter and 27,710 Model S and X vehicles. Non-GAAP automotive margin ex-ZEV credits came in at 25.5% in Q3 vs. 19.5% consensus, 21.0% in Q2 and 18.7% a year ago. Tesla's margin update: ""We expect gross margin for Model 3 to remain stable in Q4 as manufacturing efficiencies and fixed cost absorption offset a slightly lower trim mix and the negative impact of tariffs from Chinese sourced components. Gross margin for Model S and X will likely decline slightly in Q4, as we expect that the sequential increase in tariffs in Q4 from Chinese sourced components will be only partially offset by increased manufacturing cost efficiencies. For all three vehicles, additional tariffs in Q4 on parts sourced from China will impact our gross profit negatively by roughly $50M."" Capex spending in Q3 was below analyst estimates at $510.3M. Total capex spending for the year is expected to be below $2.5B. Tesla sees positive GAAP net income and positive cash flow in Q4. ""Our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230M of convertible notes in cash during Q4,"" updates the EV automaker.Lo and behold there's also an update on cancellations.

339,Safe to say Model 3 is in the spotlight,"
 The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration issued a clarification on its car safety testing ratings today. The agency noted that while a 5-star rating is the highest safety rating a vehicle can achieve, the NHTSA does not distinguish safety performance beyond that rating or make a distinction on the ""safest"" vehicle among those at the 5-star level. The development follows the awarding of a 5-star safety rating to the Tesla (TSLA +5.4%) Model 3 and some eye-popping headlines from media outlets (""Tesla���s Model 3 is the safest car on the planet according to the NHTSA""- BGR and ""Tesla Model 3 is safest car ever, according to NHTSA"" - WPXI.com) in reaction.The EV automaker for its part was quick to point out that the Model 3 has the ""lowest probability"" of injury of any car tested by the NHTSA and said there was no safer car in the world based on the strong results for the Model S and Model X as well.Tesla on the Model 3's safety mark: ""Model 3 was also designed with an extremely low polar moment of inertia, which means that its heaviest components are located closer to the car���s center of gravity. Even though Model 3 has no engine, its performance is similar to what���s described as a 'mid-engine car' due to its centered battery pack (the heaviest component of the car) and the fact that Model 3���s rear motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, it also improves the capability of stability control by minimizing rotational kinetic energy.""

 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 2.4% in premarket action on a mix of news. On Wall Street, UBS is diving into the margin outlook for Tesla, forecasting strong Model 3 pricing in Q3 and Q4 before a squeeze in 2019 as pricing normalizes. The firm expects about 77% of Model 3s to sell at a gross margin rate of less than 25% next year. Treading into familiar territory, UBS sees a capital raise out of the EV automaker at some point. Looking up north, Walmart Canada says it will order 30 additional Tesla semi trucks to bring its EV fleet up to 40 vehicles. Walmart Canada aims to electrify 20% of its fleet by 2022 and use alternative power across 100% of the fleet by 2028. Tesla also has orders on the books in Canada from Fortigo Freight and Loblaw Companies. Walmart was one of the first big names to place an order for the Tesla Semi last year. Finally, on the August U.S. sales scorecard it looks like the Model 3 ranked 5th on the list of units moved to trail the Toyota Camry, Honda Civic, Honda Accord and Toyota Corolla. Of course, the base price of the Model 3 is twice as high as those perennial top sellers. A really interesting question is where the Model 3 will rank on unit volume at the end of 2019?  ",2018-09-6

If there is a consensus among legal experts on the Musk SEC case, it's that the regulator will impose some form of penalties or punishment that falls short of trying to remove him from his CEO and chairman positions.

Both companies share a passion for hardware design, software, AI. Plus, Apple���s balance sheet makes the combination viable. Google is the next most likely acquirer. We don���t see a traditional automotive company as a potential acquirer, given they lack the cash needed to purchase Tesla even at a distressed valuation.

The Toyota-Uber autonomous vehicle development partnership announced yesterday is cited by the analyst team as an example. As far as Q3 vehicle production, Canaccord forecasts that Tesla will produce 48K to 52K Model 3 vehicles to fall short of the guidance range of 50K to 55K (related: Game on again for Tesla production forecasts). Cutting right to the case, Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer says Tesla will need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency.Dorsheimer and the Canaccord team slides the price target on Tesla to $316 from $336. After looking at Tesla's current financial status, Bond Angle's Vicki Bryan maintains an Underperform rating on the company's 5.3% Senior Note issue due in 2025. Bryan also raises an interesting point by noting that Tesla may have damaged its ability to persuade convertible bondholders to accept stock instead of cash under a general consent solicitation scenario aimed at relieving some cash flow pressure for the company. She notes that the recent turmoil may make it more difficult for Tesla to float the offer. Shares of Tesla are down 1.90% to $313.20 in early trading.  ",2018-08-28

Meanwhile, RBC Capital keeps a Sector Perform rating and price target of $315 in place, although the firm says the whole episode from start to finish leaves the bear camp with better talking points than the bulls. Taking a peek at Bloomberg's analyst ratings scorecard shows that sentiment is about evenly distributed as can be ��� with 11 Buy-equivalent ratings, 10 Sell-equivalent ratings and 11 Hold-equivalent on the books.

While conceding that Tesla's shares will remain under pressure as long as the SEC cloud hangs over it, he thinks investors may be underestimating the adjusting earnings potential of the EV automaker. In perhaps an important development, Tesla stated yesterday that it was not actively searching to hire a chief operating officer. Many analysts have stated that a COO hire could soothe some anxiety around Tesla after the ""funding secured"" tweet, stories on Musk and the late Friday night timing of its stay public plan. Veteran Tesla watcher Gene Munster of Loup Ventures thinks it will take at least six months for the sound and fury around Tesla to fade away.

 The Model 3's profitability is a critical issue for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and UBS analysts say the company would lose about $2,300 per car if it sells the vehicle at its long-promised $35,000 price tag while a more expensive version at $42,000 would eke out a $670 profit. The Model 3 price currently ranges from $49,000 to about $80,000, and UBS estimates Tesla's operating profit is $3,420 per vehicle at the low end of the range, which would help explain why CEO��Elon Musk is forecasting a profit in Q3. The lack of a $35,000 base model in Tesla���s lineup, as well as early demand for the more expensive versions, should set up the company for its best quarter of profitability from the vehicle ahead of less-costly versions down the road that will reduce the lineup���s margins, says Colin Langan, who wrote the UBS report. ���Q3 is Tesla���s best shot because of this pricing dynamic,��� Langan said of the company's profitability. ���I���m very clear that I don���t think that���s sustainable.��� ",2018-08-17

 There's no getting around that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shorts have some decisions to make as they face paper losses and potential margins calls. Cumulative mark-to-market paper losses for Tesla short sellers this year is about $3B, according to data from  financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners. ""Surprisingly, with Tesla���s stock price up 29% since their August earnings report, shares shorted has not decreased appreciably, down only 316k shares or less than 1%. Even after incurring over $1.5 billion in mark-to-market losses in August, short sellers have kept their positions and conviction,"" notes S3. Will shorts stick it out? Some Wall Street analysts expect the short-selling community to dig in even deeper on their lack of conviction that Tesla will actually go private at $420 per share. ""The capital structure is the most uncertain element about this development revealed via Twitter, as an LBO model would not work if existing investors were to remain as Mr. Musk claims they will,"" says Cowen's Jeffrey Osbourne. Meanwhile, Baird's Ben Kallo expects short covering to accelerate as some investors push Tesla for an even higher premium. The deciding factor could be either confirmation of buyout funding from a heavyweight (Chinese govt, Saudi wealth fund, shareholder group) or indications that Elon Musk doesn't have all the funding cards lined up.

483,Morgan Stanley: Can Musk really take Tesla private?,"
 Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas questions the feasibility of a potential Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) take-private transaction in a note to clients this morning. The opener: ""Elon Musk argues that Tesla could do better without the distraction and short-termism of the public market. We get that. What's harder to get is if the capital markets can support an LBO and if Tesla can support far greater financial leverage. Isn't this the moment investors waited for to exit?"" Jonas notes that taking TSLA private assumes either: (1) that it's on the verge of generating self-sustaining cash flows or, (2) that it can tap into a range of strategic sources of capital not previously at its disposal. Musk's recent attempts to support TSLA's share price seem bizarre if the plan was to take it public. ""Why announce it to the world in this way... which could significantly contribute to the required premium and leverage?"" The LBO math required to support $420/share is extremely aggressive. Jonas comes up with Ebitda margins of 15% with a 15x exit Ebitda multiple, or 20% exit Ebitda margins with an 11x exit Ebitda multiple. The closer: the benefits of being private are outweighed by the risks of added financial leverage, which can be even more strategically limiting.About 100K��TSLA��shares have changed hands premarket, currently trading at $377.

Oppenheimer (upgrades to Outperform, $385 PT): ""While we have been cautious on Model 3 ramp, we believe GM performance on Model 3 will carry the stock over the next 12+ months. With higher volumes and slower spending, we believe TSLA has reached a critical inflection point in its development. We expect bearish arguments now to focus on limited potential for Model 3 volume at higher price levels.

In a statement provided by Tesla, the company clarifies that it asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but aren't completed yet - and continues to discuss future parts costs with suppliers as a standard part of the procurement process.Previously: Tesla -4% after pressing suppliers for cash (July 23)Previously: Investors send Tesla below $300 and back (July 23)  ",2018-07-23
508,EPA to challenge California in fuel economy reset,"
 The Trump Administration plans to challenge the state of California's right to set its own fuel emissions standards in a highly-anticipated move, according to Bloomberg. The EPA will attempt to pull back the waiver granted to California as part of the Clean Air Act. As expected, the EPA will also propose to push the federal fuel economy standard back to the 2020 level of 35 mpg per manufacturer fleet.The formal proposal is expected to drop this week. Automakers for the most part are stuck in the middle. The industy opposes the timing of the Obama Administration fuel emission standards, but also fears a long legal battle that makes it difficult to plot strategy.

The company can still tap the equity and equity-linked markets for its capital needs to plug in the near-term cash bleed burn, fund the ongoing heavy capital needs, and also to address near term maturities.

""The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors,"" he explains.

The bullish camp is also having its say, Baird (Outperform rating) thinks the earnings report will be a ""de-risking"" event, while Consumer Edge (Overweight rating) reminds that recall risk is a bigger wildcard for Tesla in the long term than missed guidance. As a reminder, Tesla said last earnings go-around that it expects to produce 2.5K Model 3s per week by the end of Q1 and 5K per week in Q2.The conference call could dig into the company's new compensation deal with CEO Elon Musk and drill down on when or if a capital raise will be fired off.

 Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales in Hong Kong fell sharply after the tax breaks for electric vehicles were lowered drastically, observes Financial Times.

The WSJ later reported the company as building major parts of the Model 3 by hand.But, writes Grant, when Tesla reiterated production guidance in August, Elon Musk at that time surely knew his company wasn't going to come anywhere close to 1.5K Model 3s by the end of September. And this is only the latest example in a string of disappointments.With a $60B market cap, the company has been priced by investors for auto market domination, but how can that happen if Tesla can't profitably produce enough cars?""Tesla stock is valued as though the company can execute on its vision flawlessly.

Solar panels are a fairly small part of TSLA's business but the company's total liabilities exploded to nearly $20B after last year's SolarCity acquisition, which was approved by investors despite Musk's conflicts as the solar firm's chairman and largest shareholder.

Moody's on Tesla: ""As a result of the rapid ramp up in Model 3 production and the significant increase in capital expenditures required under the production plan, we expect that Tesla will remain free cash flow negative into 2019. Given this negative free cash flow outlook, the uncertainties associated with the launch of the Model 3, and the potential cash requirements necessary to cover the maturities of its convertible debt, Tesla will face large cash requirements through 2018. The liquidity resources available to the company provide moderately adequate coverage of these cash requirements. This is reflected in the SGL-3 liquidity rating. Tesla's principal liquidity sources include the company's $3 billion in cash, proceeds from the proposed note offering, and $900 million available under its $1.9 billion secured revolver.

 The pace of U.S. car and light truck sales fell off to a 16.73M vehicles pace in July, down from 17.8M a year ago. A significant factor in the decline is the decision by major automakers to reduce the level of daily rental fleet sales amid the rise of Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) and other ride sharing services. The strategy is expected to help lift automotive margins, even if volume numbers are lower, and falls in line with broad global strategy to highlight the bottom line over volume. ALG estimates the average transaction price for a new light vehicle rose 2.1% to $32,989 in July. Average incentive spending per unit grew by $160 to $3,565. Gaining U.S. market share during the month were Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Subaru (OTCPK:FUJHY), which both showed positive sales growth. The Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU) all posted sharp drops for the month, but analysts expect a better result for August and September off a calendar benefit (extra selling day in Aug., extra weekend in Sept.) and continued strong demand for higher trim level trucks and SUVs.

 Gene Munster tells the CNBC Squawk on the Street crew that Tesla (TSLA +1.6%) will grab market cap from energy companies as it progresses on its misunderstood mission of accelerating the global shift to renewable energy. The Loup Ventures managing partner expects a bumpy ride for Tesla investors, but thinks the markets will give Elon Musk the leverage to build out at scale.

 German automaker stocks fell after Donald Trump reportedly lamented over the lack of Chevrolets cruising around Germany. ""If you go down Fifth Avenue everyone has a Mercedes Benz in front of his house,"" POTUS told Bild. The ~1% drops for Volkswagen (VLKAY), BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) and Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) were enough to influence the auto-heavy German indexes today, according to analysts. While Trump's threat of a 35% tariff on foreign-built cars has been considered by most a negotiating tactic or bluster, there is a thought that Trump policies could help level the playing field for General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) over the long haul. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also sits on the right side of the Trump administration on the issue of jobs by manufacturing out of Fremont.Related ETF: CARZ.  ",2017-05-26

 Workers at Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) flagship plant in Fremont, Calif., were injured at a rate higher  than the industry average in 2015, and spent nearly twice as many days away from duty than the  norm, according to a new report from Worksafe, a California non-profit group. The Fremont factory had 8.8 injuries per 100 workers in 2015, compared to 6.7 for the auto industry as a whole, according to the report; industry-wide stats are not yet available for 2016, but TSLA's rate was 8.1 per 100 employees, which Worksafe says is likely to exceed the industry average. ""We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to  become a car company, but... with the  changes we've made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry  by far,"" a TSLA spokesperson says.

 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still a top pick at Baird as the firm remains convinced the Model 3 launch will be an inflection point for the stock. Analyst Ben Kallo's blue sky valuation on Tesla is $566 (85% upside potential), based off a model of 1M units (3,S,X) sold in 2020 at an average selling price of ~$52K. ""While tech companies focus on developing autonomous driving or battery technology, and traditional automobile companies are beginning to invest in electrification, we think TSLA has a unique expertise across all of three of these businesses,"" writes Kallo.Baird recommends buying shares before the Model 3 launch.

 Morgan Stanley theorizes that Waymo could be worth $70B in a spin-off scenario and compete against Tesla (TSLA -1%) for capital and talent. By comparison, Tesla trades with a market cap of just over $50B. The firm bases its estimate off of Waymo accounting for 1% of global miles driven by 2030 and generating about $1.25 in revenue per mile. ""More miles/year and revenue/mile could lead to an enterprise value of ~$140B,"" gushes MS. Waymo is seen generating operating margin of 8% at scale.

 Stanford University economist Tony Seba continues to draw attention this month with a paper predicting that a global shift to self-driving EVs will create a death spiral for Big Oil (USO, OIL)��and major automakers caught asleep. Seba, known for calling the solar energy boom in advance, sees a tipping point when EVs of under $30K can deliver 200 miles of range on a mass production basis. Some of the key snippets from his paper are posted below. ""Savings on transportation costs will result in a permanent boost in annual disposable income for U.S. households, totaling $1 trillion by 2030."" ""70% fewer passenger cars and trucks will be manufactured each year. This could result in total disruption of the car value chain, with car dealers, maintenance and insurance companies suffering almost complete destruction. Car manufacturers will have options to adapt, either as low-margin, high volume assemblers of A-EVs, or by becoming TaaS providers.""

Over the long-term, Jonas warns on the difficulty in Tesla going head-to-head against the Apple and Amazon ecosystems, while over the shorter haul the analyst now sees Tesla as reporting GAAP losses until late into 2019.Other issues of concern addressed in the note are the upside in China for Tesla and questions on if adjacent business potential (trucks, solar, storage) is enough to justify valuation. Jonas also has a Model 3 production forecast below consensus.

 Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi warns that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have difficulty hitting 25% gross margins on the Model 3 in the near to medium term due to the high battery costs and an elevated selling mix of the lower-priced versions of the sedan. He also notes that Tesla benefits at the moment from lease accounting, which could reverse in the long term. Bernstein rates Tesla at Market Perform and is in with a $250 price target on the EV seller. Earlier this week, Evercore expressed confidence that Tesla could hit its 30% margin target on the Model S and maintain a company-wide margin level above 25% after the Model 3 is introduced as the benefit of mass production factors in.Not a direct comparison to Tesla's non-GAAP ex-ZEV margin rate at all, but for reference Ford reported an automotive segment operating margin of 6.7% last year.

958,Live from Ira Sohn - updates here,"
The Sohn Investment Conference is getting underway. Seeking Alpha will donate to charity any subscriptions to SA Pro made through the conference. Up first will be some macro chatter, with Stan Druckenmiller introducing former Fed Governor and current colleague at Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office, Kevin Warsh.Warsh: The last time he's seen the sort of uniformity of thinking he's seeing now was right before the financial crisis hit. Central banks are behind this current ""gilded age,"" he says. It's been great for the balance sheets of corporations and those individuals and families wealthy enough to even have a balance sheet. Whether it's been good for everyone else and whether it's sustainable is another question.Warsh: I see risk as highest when market measures of risk are their lowest. Investors should take little comfort from a VIX of 10.Up next is Corvex Capital's Keith Meister.Meister: It sounds like he's returning to a telecom infrastructure investing idea (he recommended LVLT at a past Sohn conference). The pitch is for CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL). After the close today, Corvex is going to disclose a position in CTL north of 5%.Key to his bullishness is the merger with Level 3 - it's a gamechanger, securing CTL's 9% dividend for the long-term. It enhances the EBITDA outlook, including growth through cost synergies. Corvex's base case is 40% upside (including that fat dividend), with 50-70% on the upside.The best players need to be on the field - he wants CTL's Glen Post and LVLT's Jeff Storey teaming to ��lead the combined company, with Post gradually transitioning out of the company over a period of a few years, and Storey eventually taking charge. When you buy the New England Patriots, you're going to want to be sure Tom Brady is still going to be QB, he says.Next up is Debra Fine from Fine Capital Partners. Fine runs a highly concentrated portfolio of value names with holding periods measured in years.Fine: First up is DHX Media (NASDAQ:DHXM), (DMQHF). Kids programming doesn't age, says Fine, and DHX buys old kids shows (think Teletubbies). It's currently trading just north of $5 in Toronto, and Fine thinks it could be worth 4x-5x more.What's the market missing? Repricing of these old kids shows is underway and will need to take into account advertising parity with kids and adult programming. This is going to fall to DHX's bottom line.Scheduled for 1:25 ET is Bill Ackman.Ackman: Wants to talk about the ""risky"" land development business. If you want to find good investment ideas, says Ackman, go to the Forbes 400 and find out where folks in that group made their money. Donald Bren - owner of the master-planned community of Irvine - may be the richest man you've never heard of. But how can we invest in MPCs?Fans of Bill Ackman won't be surprised to learn the answer is Howard Hughes Corp. (NYSE:HHC) - a company Pershing has been invested in for years (since spun out of GGP in 2010), and in which Ackman happens to be the chairman.Typical valuation metrics don't work, says Ackman. He prefers a back-of-the-envelope approach. At the current stock price just above $120 per share (and rising since he started talking), investors in HHC are getting major developments in NYC, Hawaii, and 37M square feet of other future development for free.Breaking until 2:20 ET.Next up is Palihapitiya Chamath of Social Capital (who last year hit a home run at Sohn with his Amazon pick).Chamath: He's got a controversial pick, he says ... Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). After noting the remarkable achievements, he takes note of the ""bad,"" i.e. the massively capital-intensive investments the company is planning on. Totally ""unmodelable,"" says Chamath.He compares what Tesla is set on doing with what Apple did for the cell phone - they completely redefined the market for mobile phones and then mobile computing, and became a 10-bagger.Is Tesla doing same in the auto business? Yes, argues Chamath. Like the iPhone 3, Tesla's Model 3 will break down the final barriers.Chamath, however, isn't recommending the common equity, but instead the 2022 convertible bonds. They protect the downside, but capture 95% of the upside if Musk pulls it off. Stand shoulder to shoulder with this generation's Thomas Edison, concludes Chamath.Next up is David Serra from Algebris Investments.Serra: The United Kingdom is really the Divided Kingdom, he says, calling the U.K. a broken growth model - dependent on imports, weak public finances, high household leverage, stagnant productivity, growing social imbalances.The takeaway: Go short long-dated Gilts, which currently yield more than 200 basis points less than 10-year inflation expectations. Then there's the cost of Brexit - 7% of GDP over the next few years.Notable U.K. ETFs: FXB, EWU, OTC:GBB, EWUS, FKU, DXPS, DBUK, QGBR, HEWUNext up is Clifton Robbins from Blue Harbour Group.Robbins: Blue Harbour now owns just under 10% of Investors Bancorp (NASDAQ:ISBC). There are multiple ways to win with the stock, currently trading at just 1.35x book value - a signifiant discount to peers at more than 2x book.Loan growth has been speedy, but at the same time, credit quality has been better than competitors. In addition to being a well-run bank, this lender stands to benefit more than most from lower corporate taxes and regulatory reform.There's also excess capital (12.9% tangible capital ratio vs. 9% for peers). The bank, says Robbins, is sitting on $1B of excess capital - money that can be used to grow the business and buy back stock (Blue Harbour has board representation). One more catalyst - ISBC makes for an attractive acquisition target. Robbins thinks this $13 stock could be worth $18.50 based on recent comps.Coming up - Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn.Einhorn: Core Labs (NYSE:CLB) is the pick, but it's not sounding like he's long. The company has been mistakenly hyped as a secular growth story, says Einhorn. If secular, than why the sharp slowdown in earnings?Reading the company's annual reports is like reading a time capsule of whatever happens to be trendy at the time, he says. Core, he says, is riding the exploration capex cycle just like everyone else. Where there is opportunity (low margin shale) is not in the area where Core can make a lot of money - deepwater drilling. Far higher oil prices are necessary for that to come back.The stock is all over the place as Einhorn's initial comments led folks to believe he's bullish, but now - after the day's most entertaining presentation - it's crystal clear he's short. Shares are��down 2%.Jeff Gundlach is on tap for 4:15 ET.Gundlach:��His early comments suggest he's about to shoot a hole in the passive investing mania. He notes the large majorities of active managers that have failed to hit their bogies, and the massive flow of cash into passive strategies. Passive investing is a myth anyway, he says. It's just turning investment decisions over to a committee at S&P, for instance.U.S. valuations, he says, have gotten out of whack, and markets have already begun to catch on. His recommendation: Go long emerging markets (NYSEARCA:EEM), and go short the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).Sohn idea contest winners coming now.Wharton student Dylan Adelman is the winner. Introducing him, David Einhorn says he was so impressed with the idea, he wanted to buy it right away. His pick is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Next up is Brad Gerstner from Altimeter Capital.Gerstner: The ""online-travel king"" sounds like he's making a bullish call on the airline industry (NYSEARCA:JETS), noting years of investor skepticism and low valuations despite a material change in prospects. What's happened? Dramatic consolidation. With consolidation comes an end to destructive price wars.After falling on an inflation-adjusted basis forever, ticket prices are actually on the rise. Airlines have trimmed the fat so much that they'll stay profitable even if prices fall.His long idea: United (NASDAQ:UAL) - new management (which Gerstner had a part in) is making all the right moves. He sees a $135 stock in 2020 (80% upside) on a base case, and even higher in a modestly bullish case.Next up is Josh Resnick from Jericho Capital.Resnick: His pitch is a short of Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR). Why short a $1.50 stock that down 70% Y/Y? Because there's a 100% return to be made, he says (he's been short for five years).The company, he says, is going bankrupt. Step one is the elimination of the dividend (it's already been sizably slashed). Step two will be the breaking of covenants.Next up and last is Larry Robbins from Glenview Capital.DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC), FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC), and Quintiles IMS Holdings (Q) are his picks. All three are reasonably valued - about 12x earnings - despite big moves higher of late. In DXC's case, the stock has doubled over the last year, but the earnings power has grown even more - the stock could double again. ",2017-05-8

 Citi asks two great questions this morning about ""peak auto"" after watching Detroit automakers slump yesterday on a softish report on April U.S. sales. Citi snippet: ""If auto industry conditions are eroding, why did GM & Ford just last week confirm 2017 guidance? And why do auto stocks seem to react with more volatility to monthly SAAR data than fresh earnings reports?"" It's Citi contention that the market is underestimating the ""uniqueness"" of the pickup segment where a majority of GM and Ford's profits are derived. The firm has an Overweight rating on both automakers. The discussion from Citi circles back a bit to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and whether or not it's a binary decision on if Tesla winning EV mass market share is a profit killer for pickup-heavy GM and Ford. Other automakers such as Volkswagen (VLKAY), Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Honda (NYSE:HMC) derive their profit across a broader mix of segments and geographic markets. It's showtime for Tesla, with earnings due out after the bell today.

Production tracked better than expected across most regions."" Ford (Outperform, $15 PT, Q1 EPS $0.35): ""In North America, while GM has faced seeming price headwinds on older model vehicles, our sense is that Ford is enjoying relatively stronger pricing, on benefit of the new Ford Super Duty pickup truck, which continues to transact at higher than expected ATPs for this point in its product lifecycle."" Tesla (Underweight, $185 PT): ""We are updating our model for the higher than expected deliveries in 1Q17 (25,000 units vs. JPM of 24,000), higher share count post the recent equity raise, and expectation for higher than previously modeled operating expenses.

 Morgan Stanley thinks used automobile prices could fall 50% over the next five years as off-lease supply increases and higher interest rates factor in.

1117,EVs a long-term wildcard in the oil market,"
 Electric vehicles are forecast to cut into oil demand by 1M-2M bbl/day by 2035, according to oil industry consultant Wood McKenzie. That estimate is actually much more conservative than Bloomberg New Energy Finance���s estimate for EVs to impact demand by 8M bbl/day by 2035. For perspective, OPEC agreed this week to coordinated production cuts of 1.2M bbl/day which swung crude oil prices wildly. EVs are only sipping up the equivalent of 50K bbl/day currently. The general consensus even in the oil industry is that governments are moving toward major changes with pollution and emissions regulations. Just this week, the cities of Paris, Mexico City, Madrid and Athens all said they would ban the use of diesel vehicles by 2025. Beijing is also slowly adopting pro-EV policies. A higher mix of EVs in the future has already been tipped off by the dramatic long-term electrification initiatives announced this year by companies such as BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Volkswagen (VLKAY), Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM).

Also of note, the current Model 3 ramp-up plan doesn't call for any capital raise (probably) at all, he added. Missing from the buzz was any update on how many Model 3 reservations are in the hopper. In a statement with some important margin implications, Musk noted the company is selling very few cars with discounts. Musk also described the benefit of a self-driving car-sharing service in response to a question on the Tesla Network. ""It would be something that would be a significant offset on the cost of ownership for a car, and a revenue generator for Tesla as well. Obviously, the majority of the economics would go to the owner of the car,"" he noted. Tesla��+4.33%��AH to $211.00. A rosy read on the SolarCity (SCTY) acquisition helped push up shares of the solar energy firm by��3.55%��after the Tesla earnings report.Tomorrow, the Tesla analysts will start buzzing. Stay tuned.

More investment firms are now jumping into that third category. Goldman Sachs lowers its rating on Tesla Motors to Neutral from Buy and sets a 6-month price target if $185. Nothing groundbreaking, but the investment firm cites the risk of a Model 3 delay and complications from the acquisition of SolarCity. Interestingly, GS is positive on Tesla's ability to sail past Q3 EPS estimates, forecasting a $0.28 result vs. $0.07 consensus. Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley came in with an Equal-Weight rating and $245 price target (1-year) on Tesla, while voicing a similar theme of the near-term positives being outweighed by hanging cash and capital questions. MS notes the higher mix of Model X sales will help Tesla's average transaction price in Q3 and Q4.Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley aren't giving up on the Tesla disruption story, they are just going to watch it play out before advising on a long or short bet.

 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) appears to be using ""aggressive"" discounting mechanisms to meet its auto delivery goals  for Q3 and the full year, which calls long-term demand into  question, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson warns. Erickson says his conversations with 20 TSLA U.S. sales centers indicate Q3 deliveries should come in ""relatively in-line"" with his 22K estimate but that the company appears to be ""using various discounting mechanisms"" to hit its  2016 targets. The analyst says TSLA has been employing a ""deeper discounting  formula to drive sales of inventory models,"" with all promotional offers expiring on the last day of the quarter. Erickson also found that the lower-end version of the Model S is outselling the higher-end model, which could dilute profit. TSLA's ""tactics to improve optics in the face of slowing demand"" keep the analyst  cautious on the shares, which he rates as Sector Weight. ",2016-09-28

At issue is a Treasury Department policy that gives solar firms a 30% investment tax credit on the cost of acquiring a system, but solar energy developers do not always  have the income to use the credits or the funds to buy and install solar energy systems, so they routinely enlist big investors and transfer the tax benefits.

Somerset Maugham wrote in 1944.""We are on the razor's edge of achieving a good Q3, but it requires building and delivering every car we possibly can, while simultaneously trimming any cost that isn't critical, at least for the next 4.5 weeks,"" wrote Musk last week.

 Elon Musk's (SCTY -0.5%) purchase of $65M of SolarCity debt is highly unusual and does not send a good signal to investors, says Charles Elson, an authority on corporate governance at the University of Delaware. Officers or directors generally do not buy debt sold by the companies  they run, and Elson's main concerns are that owning bonds puts them at ""cross-fiduciary purposes"" with shareholders and does not signal the same confidence in the business as a stock purchase. ""When you see an officer buying stock, it is a good sign - it means the business might have a good future,"" Elson says. ""If you see them buying  debt, you wonder, what is the long-term value.""

Clean Technica dove into some of the engineering details on the new 100kWh batties.

Assign a value per drink of $2.32 and you have an incremental annual benefit of $98B for the restaurant and alcohol industry.There's conflicting data on the impact of Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) on alcohol consumption, so the Morgan Stanley theory has a ways before playing out. Still, Morgan's Adam Jonas is convinced the automobile industry is heading toward a future of fully autonomous transport in which the driving experience is nostalgic. The buying habits of younger millennials support the thesis to a degree.During the Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings call earlier this week, Elon Musk predicted global demand for self-driving cars would reach 2.5B. Execs with General Motors (NYSE:GM), BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), and Toyota (NYSE:TM) also talked autonomous models in their CCs.If Jonas and Musk are anywhere close to correct, the list of companies that could benefit from the autonomous push includes Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Dine Equity (NYSE:DIN), Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP), Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), Brinker International (NYSE:EAT), Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN), Ignite Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:IRG), Kona Grille (NASDAQ:KONA), Diageo (NYSE:DEO), Constellations Brands (NYSE:STZ), and Craft Brew Alliance (NASDAQ:BREW).Related ETF: BITE.

The most obvious target of the Gigafactory is to help Tesla reduce the cost of lithium-ion batteries dramatically, although up to a third of the output could be used to build energy storage batteries. The cost of lithium-ion battery packs is forecast by Bloomberg New Energy Finance to fall to below $200 sometime around 2020, and perhaps to the $100 k/Wh level by 2030. Elon Musk says the factory will produce 35 gigawatt hours of batteries by 2018. Total capacity of 150 gigawatt hours is forecast.

While the ramifications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Donald Trump's plan to add tariffs on foreign car makers and auto parts suppliers are already being debated, it's the union workers who may be the target of the most discussion in the next few months with Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania considered critical battleground stocks. The United Auto Workers endorsed Hillary Clinton and expects her to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to help land stronger unions in Mexico, while Trump has taken a more populist route of promising to add tariffs on Ford for cars built in Mexico. He's also hammering home that he will force better trade deals, but is walking a tightrope with some Rust Belt voters after suggesting that local plants should be closed and moved to states with lower wages.

 Analysis on a cheaper Model X from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is pouring in fast and furious.

The Gas2 site��observes that the performance of the new reduced-price Model X is very close to the other options. A buyer only gets an extra 37 miles in driving range for the additional $9K on the higher-priced X. Autoblog's take: ""Given Tesla's recent tendency to sell 'smaller' battery packs with some of the capacity limited by software, whether the 60D is really a 75D in disguise remains to be seen."" It's also a fair point that Tesla was rather quiet about this announcement compared to some of its updates. There's plenty of positive feedback on the Model X development as well.

 Peter Diamandis posted a strong defense of the Autopilot system from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) on his tech blog��today. The founder of the XPrize Foundation doubles down on the argument that the Autopilot has a stronger safety record than U.S. and global industry averages (fatalities per miles). He also points to the strategic use of mass data which will continually make Autopilot smarter. ""With every single mile driven, the cars get safer and safer,"" writes Diamandis as his thesis summary. Naturally, Elon Musk was supportive of the conclusion from Diamandis on Twitter. The enigmatic CEO��also blasted out a cryptic tweet��promising details shortly on Part 2 of the ""Tesla Secret Masterplan"" which was first disclosed in 2006.

 A thoughtful piece in Scientific American take a look at the technological challenges in delivering automated driving services. An electrical engineer at Carnegie-Mellon notes that the vision systems of today's automated test cars are imperfect by a ""very good"" margin. A mobility expert at the University of California concurs, while adding that drivers may be overestimating their car's automated capabilities due to the use of terms such as ""autopilot"" and ""self-driving."" A refined system of cameras, sensors, and radar is still believed by some engineers to be a few years off. Alphabet's (GOOG, [[GOOGL]) top exec in charge of the company's self-driving initiative seemed to back the view of the scientists in his recent testimony to Congress. ""We saw in our own testing that the human drivers can���t always be trusted to dip in and out of the task of driving when the car is encouraging them to sit back and relax,"" he stated.

1414,UBS digs in with negative view of Tesla Motors,"
 Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still rated at Sell by UBS and slapped with a $140 price target. UBS has slotted the EV automaker at Sell since July of 2015. ""We believe the market should not ignore fundamental headwinds that persist with regards to TSLA's storage business, long-term profitability of the Model 3, and eventual need to raise cash,"" reads the note from non-believer Colin Langan. Unlike some of his peers, Langan doesn't see the March 31 Model 3 reveal as a potential catalyst for shares. His take is that even a wildly positive response to the Model 3 details creates problems with short-term demand for the Model S. UBS estimates over $5B in additional capex spending by Tesla through 2025 to meet Model 3 and storage sales expectations. That's a level that implies some borrowing pressure.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is hoping to capture mainstream auto buyers with its Model 3, but it may need a federal court ruling to succeed.
The carmaker's direct-to-consumer sales are still prohibited by law in six states (Arizona, Michigan, Texas, Connecticut, Utah and West Virginia) that represent about 18% of the U.S. new-car market.
Tesla is banking on a combination of new legislation, pending dealer applications and other factors to open doors to selling directly, but the company's legal staff is ready to use a 2013 federal appeals court ruling in New Orleans�� - that determined St. Joseph Abbey could sell monk-made coffins to customers without having a funeral director's license - if necessary.

The use of stationary energy storage is two years away from a positive inflection point, says Oppenheimer analysts, but they are recommending Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Ideal Power (NASDAQ:IPWR) as investor buys sooner rather than later.
The firm sees stationary energy storage as ""clearly the area which poses the most potential for change to the status quo"" in power generation, delivery and consumption, and it foresees a fundamental change in the relationship between utilities and consumers as well as penetration of renewable energy sources.
Oppenheimer views TSLA as a ""transformative battery-powered product company with leading expertise in cell design, packaging, associated software, human-machine and machine-machine interaction design.""
The firm likes JCI as an established name in energy storage, whose Power Solutions segment should generate double-digit EBIT growth as it more than doubles its production of high-capacity absorbed glass mat batteries.
IPWR is ""an intellectual property play in energy storage and power management... well positioned for steady, profitable growth for the next 5-7 years,"" Oppenheimer says.

 The percentage of BMW (BAMXY) vehicles either leased or financed went to 46.3% in 2015 from a level of 41.8% just a year prior, observes Bloomberg Gadfly. A��massive jump for a short time period. Though the company isn't suffering from some of the delinquency issues that are picking up in the automobile industry (see subprime concerns for lenders, auto retailers, and Detroit majors), there could be implications down the road as a glut of vehicles come off their leases. Across the industry, vehicle leasing as a percentage of sales rose to 32.3% in February vs. the average of 28% in 2015. That's a development that could add to pricing pressure down the road for high-end and mass market brands as a higher percentage of vehicles come off their leases.

Meanwhile, Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both condemned the Nevada PUC's recent decision to cut net metering rates and increase connection charges for new and existing solar installations. Sanders highlighted the efforts of local utility NV Energy (owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway) to get the PUC to enact rule changes. ""You might want to be thinking about writing a letter with a few hundred thousand signatures on it to Mr. Buffett and say, ���You know what? What you���re doing here in Nevada is exactly wrong.'""
Clinton went a step further and called for federal law changes that would prohibit state agencies/utilities from retroactively changing rates and fees for existing customers. ""Utilities should not be allowed to penalize consumers with retroactive rule changes that cause financial hardship and slow the transition to a clean energy economy.""

Though SolarCity (SCTY) beat Q4 revenue and EPS estimates, the company has reported quarterly installations of 272MW (+54% Y/Y), below guidance of 280MW-300MW.
Moreover, SolarCity expects installations in seasonally weaker Q1 to total 180MW (-34% Q/Q and +18% Y/Y). SolarCity: ""This represents a higher-than-usual seasonal slowdown that we have historically experienced after strong fourth quarters largely owing to two reasons. First is the impact of our decision to end Nevada operations in December 2015; NV contributed 23 MW in Q4 2015. It also reflects our renewed focus on our cash conversion cycle, particularly in longer lead-time commercial projects."" Q1 EPS guidance of -$2.55 to -$2.65�� is below a -$2.36 consensus.
The company expects installations to ""ramp throughout 2016,"" and is reiterating full-year installation guidance of 1.25GW. SolarCity: ""Though the ITC extension certainly provides us with more tailwinds to growth, the primary focus of our company in 2016 is our goal of generating positive cash by year-end ... our guidance still implies over 40% annual growth in 2016.""

Q4 metrics:��Deployments +44% Y/Y to 253MW. Cumulative MW deployed +76% to 1.74GW. Cost/watt fell $0.13 Q/Q and $0.15 Y/Y to $2.71. Gross value of MW deployed fell $0.22 Q/Q and rose $0.06 Y/Y to $3.64. Delinquencies of 180+ days remain ""comfortably below 1%.""

Tesla Motors (TSLA +1.5%) confirms it will take orders for the Model 3 next month at $35,000. Buyers will pay less on a net basis after federal and state tax incentives are factored in.
Conventional wisdom indicates vehicles need to be priced in a $25K to $35K range to be sold on a mass-market basis. GM is aiming for the middle part of that range with its all-electric Bolt.
The latest word from Palo Alto is that the Model 3 is still on schedule, although CEO Elon Musk will face some Q&A tomorrow after the EV automaker reports earnings.

SolarCity (SCTY) is a standout on a good morning for both the Nasdaq (up 1.1%) and energy-related names - WTI crude is up 7.7% to $34.77/barrel amid growing hopes of Saudi/Russian oil production cuts.
The gains come on a day California's PUC is expected to vote on a final net metering rate plan (previous) for the state's solar installations; California remains by far SolarCity's biggest market. Greentech Media: ""So far, we���ve seen little sign that commissioners are going to reconsider the key solar-friendly points of last month���s proposed decision -- namely, retaining retail-rate compensation for customers' surplus solar power and rejecting additional fees for net-metered solar systems."" Unlike with December's Nevada PUC ruling, local utilities aren't happy with the California proposal.
Roth Capital has reiterated a Buy rating and $65 target on SolarCity today, arguing risk/reward is favorable following a major early-2016 decline. The firm cautions it doesn't think SolarCity will be ""out of the woods"" until the California net metering decision arrives.

Thus far, the company has relied on other financing sources, such as tax equity financing and the sale of solar asset-backed notes.
The first asset sale is expected to involve just 100MW-200MW of leases.

1481,Faraday Future concept car unveiled at CES,"
 Faraday Future unveiled its concept car last night at CES in front of automobile industry watchers and key investors. The FF Zero 1 concept vehicle resembled the Batmobile more than anything on the market today. The presentation by Faraday played up the variable architecture platform it plans to use that will be scalable to different drivetrain types. The company also said it aims for a complete ""rethink"" of what mobility means in the automobile industry. Chinese investor-backed Faraday aims to start producing pure EVs in 2017 out of a manufacturing facility near Las Vegas. If the company can bridge the large gap between concept and production reality it is seen as a potential challenger to Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BMW (BAMXY) from which Faraday has hired some key engineers.

1486,"Solar ITC extension could cripple installations next year, analyst says","
 The solar industry���s (NYSEARCA:TAN) foremost bear, Axiom���s Gordon Johnson, says an extension of tax credits for solar installations for years will rob the industry of the urgency that might be there to install panels before credits run out, which he sees as a particular negative for stocks such as SunEdison (SUNE) and SolarCity (SCTY). In the absence of a demand pull-in next year, U.S. demand is likely to be much worse than anticipated, Johnson says, and ""against this backdrop, we see the PV module market shifting back into a state of structural oversupply.""
The analyst sees the ITC extension making it harder for the likes of SUNE and SCTY to sell their projects, citing ""an unquantifiable number of utility projects that were not going to get done due to the ITC cut now can, [and] it will enable marginal cost DevCos to continue to compete.""

""The PUC has protected NV Energy's monopoly, and everyone else will lose.

The remarks come a day after the Nevada PUC officially signed off on net metering rate cuts and higher connection charges for residential and commercial solar installations.
SolarCity: ""Most disturbing is the PUC's decision to retroactively sabotage existing solar customers' investments by changing the rules on them ... These actions are certainly unethical, unprecedented, and possibly unlawful.""
Yesterday, Bryan Miller, a Sunrun VP and the president of trade group TASC, suggested a lawsuit challenging the PUC decision is on the way. ""In a similar situation in Wisconsin, the Commission acted without evidence and attempted to eliminate the solar industry. TASC sued and TASC won, and TASC expects to do the same here.""

Up big last week thanks to the ITC extension, SolarCity (SCTY -5.4%), Sunrun (RUN -12.3%), Solar3D (SLTD -3.3%), and RGS Energy (RGSE -6.5%) have sold off as Nevada's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) weighs a proposal to increase connection charges and lower net metering payments (i.e. payments for electricity delivered to the grid) to the state's residential and commercial solar users.
SolarCity has threatened to pull out of Nevada, and other installers have also blasted the proposal, which would grant a victory to Berkshire Hathaway-owned utility NV Energy. Nevada has less than 1% of the U.S. population, but (for obvious reasons) accounts for a larger % of solar generation. Moreover, the PUC proposal is stoking fears of similar actions in other net metering states.
SunEdison (down 19.4%) and acquisition target Vivint Solar (down 7.4%) are also off sharply, but that appears to have more to do with David Tepper's actions than the Nevada PUC's.

Update (2:42PM ET): The PUC has passed the proposal. Sunrun: ""We believe the Commission���s decision flies in the face of Nevada law, which requires the state to 'encourage private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate the economic growth of this State; and enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources used in this State' through net metering. We believe the Commission, appointed by Governor Sandoval, has done the exact opposite today.""

SolarCity (SCTY) says it will be forced to ""cease sales and installation operations in Nevada"" if a proposal on solar charges is approved by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) tomorrow.

The proposal includes a two-part tariff consisting of a fixed service charge and a volume-based commodity charge, and would apply retroactively to all net metering customers (i.e. solar users being credited for electricity delivered to the grid). Local utility NV Energy had been seeking a demand charge.
The PUC is also proposing to transition all residential and small commercial net metering customers to a cost-based rate structure over the next four years to eliminate ""unreasonable"" cost shifts between ratepayers.
SolarCity: ""There is so much wrong with the decision, the only option for the PUC is to reject it. The one beneficiary of this decision would be NV Energy, whose monopoly will have been protected ... The decision would retroactively sabotage the investments Nevadans have already made in solar, even though they were encouraged by their government to make those investments.""

""We think it is extremely unlikely that a single person or even a small company that lacks extensive engineering validation capability will be able to produce an autonomous driving system that can be deployed to production vehicles,"" says Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in a response to yesterday's Bloomberg article about the efforts of software engineer George Hotz (was reportedly offered a job by Elon Musk) to create a self-driving system.
Tesla: ""[Such a system] may work as a limited demo on a known stretch of road -- Tesla had such a system two years ago -- but then requires enormous resources to debug over millions of miles of widely differing roads. This is the true problem of autonomy: getting a machine learning system to be 99% correct is relatively easy, but getting it to be 99.9999% correct, which is where it ultimately needs to be, is vastly more difficult.""
The company adds its autopilot system was developed in-house, and isn't an example of repackaging a supplier's technology. ""Tesla Autopilot includes radar, ultrasonics, GPS/nav, cameras and real-time connectivity to Tesla servers for fleet learning. Going forward, we will continue to use the most advanced component technologies, such as Mobileye���s (MBLY +3.7%) vision chip, in our vehicles. Their part is the best in the world at what it does and that is why we use it.""
Mobileye is rebounding a day after selling off in the wake of the Bloomberg article and a Citron Research tweet calling the company is 2016 short of the year. Aside from Tesla's remarks, a defense by Raymond James' Tavis McCourt (Outperform rating) could be helping out.
McCourt: ""We would note that Mobileye���s development of algorithms for autonomous driving also utilizes artificial intelligence, deep learning, and all the latest and greatest buzzwords ... from what we can tell from the article, Hotz is utilizing very similar development technology as Mobileye, but with 1/100th the number of engineers and giving Mobileye a 16-year head start. The solution also does not appear to be price-disruptive as Hotz mentions a $1,000 price point in the article. All-in costs of Mobileye single-camera solutions (including tier-1 integration) is roughly $100 today, so an eight-camera configuration for autonomous driving would likely be at or even cheaper than what Hotz appears to be proposing.""

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has voted to keep the state's solar net metering program (credits solar panel owners for electricity they deliver to the grid) beyond 2017, while making a handful of changes.
Among them: 1) An interconnection fee (estimated at $75-$150 for new customers) will be imposed. 2) To help finance low-income and energy-efficiency programs, net metering customers will have to pay $0.02-$0.03/kWh in ""non-bypassable charges"" for electricity consumed. 3) System owners will have to adopt time-of-use electricity rates.
The CPUC is also setting up a program to provide assist solar installations by multi-family buildings, and one to help residential customers in lower-income communities to take part in net metering even if they're renters.
SolarCity (SCTY), which counts California as (by far) its largest market, has responded with a statement praising the CPUC for extending net metering, while calling its decision to require new customers to be on time-of-use rates concerning.

He also says the accounting method used by most E&P companies obscures their actual earnings, distorting the way they report EBITDA figures: ���Real levels of EBITDA may be lower - significantly lower,��� he says, meaning investors may be paying much higher multiples than they realize for these stocks. Chanos has been bearish on Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) and SolarCity (SCTY).

Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) anticipated autopilot system becomes officially available starting tomorrow as a software update for Model S sedans made after Sep. 2014, as well as Model X SUVs. It uses a mixture of radar, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras to allow a car to change lanes, search for parking, parallel park, and adjust its speed based on traffic flow by itself.
An auto-steer function is in beta. Altogether, ~60K existing vehicles will support autopilot, but only those who paid $2,500 for it will have access to the full system. Others will only have access to a side-impact warning feature.
Elon Musk isn't shy about talking up the system. ""I think this is going to be quite a profound experience for people. It will change people's perception of the future quite drastically ... Because the software is still at an early stage, it's important people exercise caution, In the long term, drivers will not need to keep their hands on the wheel.

 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight with a $180 price target - which would breach a 52-week low - today at Barclays, which says the slow Model X ramp reinforces its view that TSLA will miss its 2015 delivery forecast.

Yet last week���s X launch failed to boost the shares - indicating a lack of story-driven buying support."" Johnson says the X launch reinforces three risks to TSLA���s future stream of deliveries: that TSLA will significantly miss 2015 delivery guidance, there may be little offset from Model S if the X ramp is slow in 2016, and calling into question whether Model 3 will launch on time - which may lead to doubts on the company's ability to become a mass market OEM.

CEO Lyndon Rive has responded to Jim Chanos' bearish Friday remarks. Regarding Chanos' assertion that SolarCity is a subprime finance company at heart, Rive notes the average FICO credit score for SolarCity customers is 740, well above the 640 level considered the threshold for subprime lending. ""[Chanos is] wrong. He knows this. Our FICO score is public when we do securitizations ... He's intentionally saying this to add more pressure to the stock so he can make money.""

Obama���s climate plan, with the White House apparently abandoning its previous enthusiasm for gas as a cleaner alternative to coal.

American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP)��CEO Nicholas Akins says the U.S. does not have the luxury of being able to ditch nat gas, saying the only way to power big industrial processes is through large-scale, 24-hour generation close to consumers - ���solar doesn���t provide that and wind doesn���t provide that.""

Vehicle sales were up 1.4% to 11.85M units during 1H. Volkswagen (VLKAY) relies on China for half of its net profit and 71% of free cash flow. Credit Suisse notes the China factor gives the German automaker the punch to make a dividend possible. General Motors (NYSE:GM) churned up 40% of its new income and 20% to 30% of its operating cash flow from China, according to an estimate from Barclay tied to its downgrade of GM earlier in the week. Goldman Sachs and Buckingham Research have also recently cut profit estimates on GM. Ford (NYSE:F) cut its sales outlook for the China auto market to 24M-26M vehicles after Q1. The company could revise the broad forecast lower again with its Q2 report on July 28 and reset its own sales expectations.

 Electric vehicles sales in the U.S. are tracking almost even with last year's pace after five months. An increase in advertising and key price cuts on some models contributed to a M/M boost in demand in May, according to analysts. There's also the ZEV factor as automakers balance EV production levels against government mandates. Despite the sluggish pace of EV sales over the last year, a fresh report from Navigant Research estimates 1.1M plug-in electric vehicle sales by 2024 as more models are introduced with extended ranges and mass-market pricing. TrueCar estimates several models will sell over 100K per year after the 200-mile range threshold is crossed. Though the Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 and General Motors (NYSE:GM) Bolt are the models given the best chance by some analysts to put out large volume numbers, Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) is also waiting in the wings with a second-gen Leaf and Infiniti EV.
Early demand for the BMW��(BAMXY)��i3 has surprised on the upside which may reinforce the German automaker's ambition in the segment.
Ford (NYSE:F)��and Toyota (NYSE:TM) are adopting a nimble strategy with EV��production which may pay off in the long term.  ",2015-06-5
1652,Debate stirred up over government incentives for Tesla Motors,"
 Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.3%) CEO Elon Musk called into CNBC this afternoon to take issue with a detailed Los Angeles Times article on the amount of subsidies the automaker has taken in or is set to earn. 
The LA Times came up with a $4.9B figure for government support when adding all incentives for Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX - although Musk said the payments are spread out over 20 years and based on financial performance instead of a blank check.
Musk noted the incentives that Tesla receives for projects such as the Gigafactory are helpful, but also maintained they aren't necessary for Tesla's survival.
There's some conspiracy theory hinted by Musk on the involvement of oil & gas interests in the anti-Tesla push and the incentives paid to other automakers with fewer questions raised. CNBC interview of Musk  ",2015-06-1

1654,The secret weapon from Tesla Motors may have arrived,"
 Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.4%) unleashed a few pop-up stores last weekend in the U.S. in an initiative that could be part of the company's plan to disrupt the traditional dealership model. Early reviews on the pop-up stores that can be transported around the country on flat-bed trucks have been mostly positive. 
Silicon Valley Business Journal even speculates pop-up stores could be the secret weapon referenced by Elon Musk earlier this year. ""I do have a secret weapon on the demand side that will probably start to deploy later this year for demand generation,"" teased Musk on a conference call.
Theories on the secret weapon have drifted from rentals to trade-in programs, but many Tesla watchers see the pop-up concept as the most logical on the potential to help push the company into new high-traffic areas of Europe and China. Tesla Q4 earnings call transcript

Mazda was toying with building its own fuel cell vehicle��before deciding to team up with Toyota. Toyota is a leader in the burgeoning hydrogen FCV industry and is sharing some of its patents for free in an effort to see infrastructure build-out expand in key nations. Battle lines are still being drawn over the direction of next-gen vehicles with Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:MMTOF) and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF) more heavily exploring��hydrogen fuel cells - while the Detroit Big Three (GM, F, FCAU) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) have a sharper focus on battery-powered electric vehicles.
German automakers (VLKAY, OTCPK:DDAIF, BAMXY) are seen hedging their bets a bit with the group supporting efforts to build out a hydrogen charging network in Germany and selling electric vehicle (PHEV, BEV, hybrids) models at the same time.
Some analysts think politicians may have the final say. The 2016 U.S. presidential election and the success of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are key factors.

 Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) new batteries have generated $800M in potential revenue for the company in just the first few days of reservations since their April 30 introduction, according to Bloomberg's calculations. If the battery reservations actually turn into revenue, it would be almost as much as the  company took in from car sales in the entire Q1; demand is ""crazy off-the-hook,"" CEO��Elon Musk said during the Wednesday earnings call. But the $800M figure may be way optimistic: TSLA���s Powerwall home batteries can be reserved online, years in advance, with no money down and no commitment to buy, and at least some of the early demand will ease once the excitement fades and the reality of a $3K-$3.5K purchase settles in. The uncertainty creates a difficult valuation problem for Wall Street; analysts at Baird  and Morgan Stanley��do not yet include the battery business in their TSLA  valuation, and J.P.

 General Motors (GM +0.8%) says it expects to miss a sales target of having 500K electric vehicles on the road by 2017. Lower gas prices and an increase in EV competition are cited as factors by the Detroit heavyweight. The automaker disclosed in its 2014 sustainability report that there was 180,834 GM EVs on the road in the U.S. last year. The 500K mark is a little bit of a talking point in the auto industry with Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.7%)��CEO Elon Musk also throwing out the number as an annual sales target by 2020. All indications from GM have been that development on the new electric Chevy Bolt is on schedule.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) produced 11,160 vehicles in Q1, down slightly from Q4's 11,627 but beating guidance of 10K. 10,045 vehicles were delivered, close to the 10,030 previously announced and up from Q4's 9,834.
The company expects to deliver 10K-11K vehicles in Q2, below estimates of ~12K. But it still forecasts 55K 2015 Model S and X deliveries. Q2 production is expected to total 12.5K. The Model X is on track to see deliveries start in late Q3.
Model S average transaction price is expected to drop Q/Q in Q2 thanks to a weak euro (a 100+ bps gross margin impact is expected). Tesla has responded by hiking European prices by ~5%. Operating expenses are expected to rise 10% Q/Q in Q2, and 45%-50% Y/Y in 2015. The 2015 capex budget is still at $1.5B.

Financials: Q1 gross margin (non-GAAP) was 28.2%, up from Q4's 26.7% and Q1 2014's 25.2% in spite of a strong dollar, and contributing to the EPS beat. Auto gross margin (exc. ZEV credits) was 26%, and services/other gross margin -3.2%; Tesla expects the latter to be slightly above breakeven in Q2. R&D spend +117% Y/Y to $147.4M; SG&A spend +82% to $147.4M. The company ended Q1 with $1.51B in cash, down $396M Q/Q thanks to $426M in capex.

Other details: 1) Order rates are said to have ""accelerated even further"" in Q2 thanks to greater availability of the Model S 85D and 70D. 2) Volume production for Tesla's home/commercial batteries is expected to start in Fremont, CA in Q3, and expand to the Gigafactory in Q1 2016. 3) To lower costs, Tesla is now shipping cars via rail rather than trucks in more regions, and ""producing cars based on a uniform regional production mix.""

Vance adds Tesla would've cost Google $6B at the time after factoring ""a healthy premium"" - Tesla's market cap is currently $25.9B. As part of the deal, Musk wanted Google to promise to invest $5B in factory expansions and let Musk run Tesla for 8 years, until it was ready to launch a mass-market car.
While ""Musk, Page, and Google���s lawyers negotiated the specific terms of the deal"" in the following weeks, Tesla's Model S sales began to take off, and the company posted its first profit and repaid its DOE loan. No longer needing a white knight, Musk broke off talks.

 The roll-out of 4G LTE high-speed wireless connections in all 2016  General Motors (NYSE:GM) models could provide the automaker with new sources of revenue and jump-start tech initiatives of rivals. GM sees OnStar 4G leading to e-commerce revenue from transaction splits (fast-food, hotel rooms, entertainment, advertising), services, and data usage. Software upgrades pushed out via broadband connections could also save GM money on repair and warranty costs. While execs with GM estimate OnStar will generate $350M in profit over the next three years, some analysts have aimed much higher with their projections. Gartner sees 10% of all revenue from the automobile industry generated from connected broadband platforms by 2020 - a formidable mark which explains the increasing presence of Apple and Google in the sector. Partnerships between Silicon Valley and Detroit are expected to accelerate. GM sits in a nice position to defend its turf against the tech heavyweights through its valuable OnStar property - while��BMW (BAMXY), Audi (VLKAY), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also a few steps away from Internet-based revenue streams.

Believing ""numerous catalysts"" exist for the next 6-9 months, BofA/Merrill (Buy) is holding onto its $95 SolarCity (SCTY) target (71% above current levels).
Among the potential catalysts: 1) Clarity on California's solar retail rates and net metering policies. 2) Improved booking/installation mix leading to better retained value. 3) The arrival of 2016 installation guidance (possibly in Q4). 4) The ""emergence of a cash flow oriented view of [SolarCity's] operating systems.""
The firm values SolarCity's existing operating business at $40/share. It assigns a $55/share valuation to its solar development ops, which was forecast to deliver 15.4GW of installations from 2018-2024.

SolarEdge's systems replace traditional solar junction boxes with DC/DC converters (referred to by the company as power optimizers) attached to individual solar panels; the converters optimize power output by tracking each module's maximum power point. They also feature DC/AC inverters that are simpler and cheaper than traditional inverters (since power tracking and voltage management is handled by the power optimizers), and Web-based system monitoring software.
The company had revenue of $140.3M (+141% Y/Y) during the six months ending Dec. 31, and net income of $5.9M. Shipped products went into 389MW of systems, up from 153MW a year earlier.

Looking ahead: Though EV sales are only a fraction of the total U.S. auto market, repping only ~15% of sales of the Toyota Camry for instance, major bets are being laid out by automakers on research and development. Exponential demand growth in the segment will be needed to make the Model X, Chevrolet Bolt, BMW��i3, 2016 Toyota Prius PHV, 2016 Leaf, and other notable entries major successes.

However, Baribeau ""[remains] confident in SolarCity's momentum,"" and expects the company to generate ""significant value"" from its contracted assets in time. Q4 supply chain talks indicate U.S. residential solar demand remains ""very strong.""
Regarding SunEdison, he's worried the company is ""taking on a greater amount of execution and capital risk following announcements of potential manufacturing capacity and international joint ventures.""

Since lower gas prices should reduce shipping costs, Stanley sees the benefit trickling into Q1 per-unit shipping costs at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

1791,SolarCity +3.7% after CEO talks oil prices on CNBC,"

Given ""almost no oil is used"" to produce electricity in the U.S., weak oil prices will have no impact on the domestic electricity market, SolarCity (SCTY) CEO Lyndon Rive told CNBC (video) yesterday evening. ""If the [stock] market is reacting to the low cost of oil ... the market is just wrong.""
Rive did admit weak natural gas and coal prices have an effect, but added transmission and distribution infrastructure costs have a much bigger impact. To back up his point, he noted retail electricity prices have risen in recent years in spite of plunging natural gas prices.
Rival Vivint Solar (VSLR +4%) is also rallying.

Shah expects strong 2015 solar demand in the U.S., China, and India, and thinks the U.S. market is especially well-insulated from falling oil prices, given local electricity prices are unlikely to drop near-term.
He recommends buying SolarCity (SCTY), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), SunEdison (SUNE), Trina (NYSE:TSL), and Vivint (NYSE:VSLR) on weakness. Shah, long a SolarCity bull, adds ""improving financing costs and greater penetration in new states could continue to drive positive demand momentum"" for SolarCity and Vivint.

Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) dual-motor, all-wheel drive, P85D features plenty of advanced driver-assistance features, enough so that it's declared to have an autopilot mode. Model S cars produced over the last two weeks also have the hardware to support the features, some of which likely rely on Mobileye's (NYSE:MBLY) systems.

Ars Technica: ""[Tesla's] hardware includes forward-looking radar, image-recognition cameras, and 360-degree ultrasonic sonar. All these gizmos will give the Model S the ability to read speed limit signs and cruise at whatever the road's limit happens to be, along with the ability to automatically change lanes when a driver indicates with the car's turn signal. The updated autopilot package will also include standard driver assistance tools like lane departure warnings, adaptive cruise control, and automated braking.""
However, the P85D is a high-end car: Prices range from $105K-$120K. Dual-motor Model S units will sell for $71K-$85K. The release of a mass-market Tesla remains a future event.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 4.3% today on news it sold fewer  cars last month in Norway, one of its top markets in Europe; with the U.S. flat and Europe flat to down in deliveries, TSLA��may be running out of new countries to meet expectations.
TSLA sold 536 Model S electric cars in Norway in June, a steep drop from 1,493 sold there in March, which was an all-time single market sales record in the country.
Some investors also pointed to worries  brought on by LG Chem's apparent deal to build a  battery plant in China to supply automakers such as state-owned SAIC Motor and GM.
Also, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passes legislation to cap at five the number of TSLA retail stores in the state, a compromise that allows the electric car seller to avoid a battle with dealer groups; Ohio and New York have adopted similar legislation, and a similar bill is pending in New Jersey.

 The latest rout in once-high-flying tech momentum plays isn't leaving solar stocks unscathed. The Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN -6.2%) is now down 21% from its March 7 high of $51.07. Likely adding fuel to the fire: Credit Suisse has slashed its 2014 Chinese solar installation forecast by 500MW to 11.5GW, soundly below the government's 14GW target (set in February). CS thinks policy changes related to utility-scale projects, feed-in tariff reimbursement, and distributed solar incentives are needed for investment to pick up. The firm adds JinkoSolar (JKS -10.8%), Trina (TSL -12.2%), and Canadian Solar (CSIQ -12.8%) are well-positioned to profit from downstream projects, given they have access to financing from the China Development Bank and other sources. On the other hand, it thinks Yingli (YGE -4.1%) and ReneSola (SOL -8.8%) are ""less likely to access project capital due to their strained balance sheets.""

 An audacious plan by Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) to build the world's largest lithium-ion battery factory continues to be the focus of the electric vehicle industry as the success of the Gigafactory could stand as the make-or-break point for the technology. The company has narrowed the potential sites for the Gigafactory to Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and New Mexico with each state likely to throw in some incentives. Despite the potential boost from state governments, the EV automaker still needs a large partner or two to share the costs of the massive project with it. Panasonic is the logical choice, but the company hasn't fully committed to investing in the Gigafactory. What to watch: At the core of the strategy behind the ambitious Gigafactory project is a goal of slashing the cost of the lithium cell batteries for Tesla vehicles.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will end all electric car sales in New Jersey starting April 1, after it failed to head off a state regulatory proposal making it illegal for it to sell vehicles to consumers without a dealer.
The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission approved a rule change today that requires auto retailers to have a franchise agreement with an auto manufacturer to be granted a license to sell cars in the state,  joining Arizona and Texas by insisting TSLA follow  the traditional formula of selling vehicles through licensed dealer franchises.
TSLA's VP of business development said today during a conference call that Gov. Chris Christie's administration ""abrogated"" an agreement to hold off action on the proposal.

 Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer thinks Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.1%) CEO Elon Musk made a rookie mistake by rankling the NHTSA this week over what constitutes a recall. Though Musk made a decent point by correcting what many early reports had posted as a traditional recall of Model S cars, a seasoned automobile industry executive would have kept his or her Twitter feed quiet, thinks Brauer.

 Kelley Blue Book sees U.S. auto sales of 16.3M units this year to rep a growth rate of 4.9%. One of the biggest risks to the industry is a bump in interest rates to a level where buyers are pushed away from purchasing new cars. Industry watchers think the luxury sector (VLKAY, BAMXY, OTCPK:DDAIF) could see the sharpest impact as consumer previously willing to stretch trade down. Ford's (F) increased use of aluminum in the widely popular F-150 line will be in focus. Analysts think could consumer reaction could go either way. Rival truck makers like Ram (FIATY) are set to pounce if the aluminum concerns show any validity. Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY) are betting big on growth in the U.S. as tensions in China continue to crop up and clip sales from climbing to full potential .The group is seen as likely to use incentives and promotions in the U.S. to gain market share if sales momentum slows.

SolarCity (SCTY)��+3.8% premarket after Deutsche Bank initiates coverage with a Buy rating and $90 price target, as analyst Vishal Shah expects SCTY's install base to double through 2015 and 2016.
The firm believes SCTY is poised to benefit from accelerating growth of distributed generation as retail electricity customers switch to solar and an increasing number of U.S. states achieve grid parity by 2016.
Shah estimates SCTY's market penetration is ~0.2% in existing markets and  thinks cumulative MW deployed can reach at least 3 GW by 2016, which  would still imply only ~1% market penetration; he says his 2016 estimates are  likely conservative as SCTY is targeting 1M customers, implying ~6 GW deployed by mid-2018.

With shares of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA)  down nearly 40% from their recent highs, Wall Street is still  vigorously debating if the stock is now cheap or still grossly  overvalued.
Deutsche Bank's Dan Galves says the stock is now discounting pre-Gen 3 earnings and the sell-off creates a favorable entry point.  ""We are reiterating our Buy recommendation  as we see a series of positive catalysts over the next several months  that could lead to renewed confidence in earnings  trajectory. These include: 1) A favorable resolution of the NHTSA  investigation; 2) Initial news on (what we believe will be very strong) China order flows; 3) Increased  visibility on an accelerating order/production ramp, and; 4) Further  gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage (which may be  significantly better than consensus).  The firm maintained a Buy rating  and price target of $200.
Meanwhile BofA's John Lovallo says shares remain overvalued even after the  sell-off. He reiterates an Underperform rating and $45 price target, saying the company would have to  348K vehicles/year by 2020 to justify the current valuation.

I see no reason for long-term rates to head higher, says Jeff Gundlach, appearing on CNBC. He doesn't see the taper coming soon - incomes are falling, the labor force participation rate is stuck, and inflation is non-existent. Further, why would Janet Yellen take the Fed helm and immediately begin to reverse a policy she's so supportive of?
Without the taper, he notes, QE is actually expanding on a relative basis thanks to a smaller budget deficit and less Treasury issuance needing to be mopped up by the central bank.
The best opportunity in fixed income continues to be closed-end funds trading at discounts to net asset value��(his DBL being one of them). You can put together a basket of these, he says, yielding 8-9% and with a discount to NAV of 10%. Others possibilities (though we haven't checked their prices vs. NAV): PDI, PTY, PCI, PHK, PKO, PCN, PCI, PFN, PFL.

2202,Barron's makes the bear case on SolarCity,"

Most of SolarCity's (SCTY) tax benefits and a portion of future cash flows have been pledged to ""tax-equity"" partners whose claims on the company are often ahead of common stockholders. Should those obligations not be met - i.e., government subsidies get cut, defaults on lease payments - the company may need to raise money elsewhere.
An examination of solar contracts in Arizona and California by Barron's finds SolarCity (SCTY) estimates the fair market value of its panels significantly higher than that of its competitors. Why does this matter? It's a key factor in determining the level of government aid. The government has been on the case and a cut in reimbursements created a potential $8.2M shortfall in money owed to tax equity partners (SolarCIty has sued the government; the DOJ and Treasury are investigating ""possible misrepresentations by SCTY and others).
Somehow the company will need more financing, especially as federal tax credits fall to 10% in 2017. Current tax-equity financing is enough to deploy 169MW of power. To meet Street financial models, SolarCity likely needs to install more than 1,000MW by 2017.

(S-1s: I, II)
SolarCity announced a $175M convertible debt offering in June. Shortly before that, the company obtained a $100M loan to help finance panel installations, and reached a $500M+ financing deal with Goldman.

Kelley Blue Book is a tad more conservative with an estimate of 15.6M. Though an aging U.S. fleet and macroeconomic factors are often cited as the major demand boosts for the industry, analysts think a higher percentage of loans over five years has helped ease pricing.

Elon Musk has published a 57-page document providing technical details, route proposals, and anything else readers might want to know about the Hyperloop, a solar-powered, aluminum pod-based, transportation system Musk asserts can safely send passengers from San Francisco to L.A. in 30 minutes.
In a BloombergBusinessWeek interview published in tandem with the document, Musk claims Hyperloop pods will be able to travel at 800 mph, and can carry cars as well as people. ""You just drive on, and the pod departs."" The magazine adds ""about a dozen people at Tesla and SpaceX have helped Musk with the design and checked the physics.""
