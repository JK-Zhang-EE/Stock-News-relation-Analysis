Analysts react to President Trump's threat yesterday of a 10% tariff on Apple's (AAPL -0.5%) iPhones.
UBS says the threat could be a ""negotiating tactic ahead of the G20 Summit later this week."" But the firm estimates the tariff, if it happens, would represent a $1.5B hit to Apple's earnings. If Trump raised the rate to 25%, as threatened, the hit would be about $3.8B or $0.83 in EPS.
Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi says 25% of Apple's revenue would be subject to the 10% or 25% tariff. The analyst notes that China could retaliate through Apple supply chain disruption or iPhone sales blocks, which ""could ultimately be even more devastating"" than the tariffs.

Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots and strokes when untreated and diagnosis is difficult as symptoms often don?�t become obvious until too late. An estimated 2.7M Americans and 34M people globally have the problem.  Researchers used an app from Cardiogram Inc. to access heart-rate sensor data in the Watch. A deep neural network analyzed the heart rate data and step-count data, which was used to determine whether a person was active (explaining a sudden heart rate spike) or at rest.  The resulting algorithm was able to tell the difference between atrial fibrillation and normal heartbeats with about 97% compared to electrocardiograms. This data came from about 50 patients with atrial fibrillation who were undergoing procedures to restore their heart rates to normal.            In a test of 1,620 people using the Watch in their everyday lives, the algorithm?�s accuracy dropped to about 72% accuracy compared to participant reports of whether or not they had atrial fibrillation.??

Smartwatches expected to sell 41.5M units this year and 81M in 2021, which would represent 16% of the wearables market.                   The watches would come second only to Bluetooth headsets in unit sales between 2019 and 2021.?                  Gartner research director Angela McIntyre puts the smartwatch ASP at $223.25 this year and expects the number to drop to a $214.99 ASP by 2021 due to higher volumes.                   Apple leads the smartwatch market with a one-third share last year but that could shrink to a quarter in 2021 due to increasing competition from Samsung, LG, and Huawei.?               Apple should announce the Watch Series 3 at a launch event next month, rumored for September 12 announcement. The Series 3 could feature cellular connectivity through an embedded SIM that might not require tethering to an iPhone. ????Previously: Digitimes: Apple Watch will ship 20M units next year (Aug. 18) ",0.9756,positive,0.8321573699421965

 AT&T's (T -3%) interest in Time Warner (TWX +7.8%) progressed quickly from ""had talks"" to ""advanced talks"" and now a deal could be set by Monday -- which Bloomberg says is due to a sped-up timetable caused by Bloomberg's initial report. That's because AT&T is said to be concerned that the publicity could allow other interested suitors like Apple (AAPL -0.4%) or Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) to jump in -- and indeed Apple is said to be monitoring the deal talks, after it made its own approach to Time Warner a few months ago, The Wall Street Journal reports. Those talks involved execs under Apple chief Tim Cook and didn't get beyond a preliminary stage. A source tells the WSJ that Google doesn't look interested in an offer for Time Warner. But the story of the deal points out just how much behind-the-scenes strategic talk is going on in the media/telecom spaces, as companies vie to be among the new leaders in an upended, converged digital media climate. Sumner Redstone was said to be considering not only the merger of CBS (CBS +2.1%) and Viacom (VIA +2.7%, VIAB +2.8%) that he's already pushing for, but also to combine that entity with Time Warner.

Startup Light?�s L16 camera is the first salvo in the company's attempt to upend a digital SLR market dominated by Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Nikon (OTCPK:NINOY). The L16 contains 16 different sets of lenses and sensors - five shoot at 35mm, and the other 11 at 75-150mm - in a form factor resembling that of point-and-shoot cameras. Up to ten of the lenses/sensors simultaneously fire when a picture is taken.
As a result, only zoom and shutter speed are determined at the time of shooting. Unlike with conventional cameras, qualities such as focus and depth-of-field can be adjusted afterwards thanks to the L16?�s use of computational imaging. Meanwhile, having up to ten lenses/sensors fire at once allows the L16 to create images as large as 52MP, and helps a lot with low-light photography.
At $1,699, the L16 isn?�t cheap. And even if one was willing to spend that much to buy one, pre-orders have sold out. However, Light insists the L16 is simply a proof-of-concept, and that its long-term goal is give consumers cameras that can deliver both professional-quality photos and smartphone-like simplicity. Light could have a tough time winning over professional photographers who depend on DSLRs and their professional-grade lenses. However, the company insists enthusiast consumer photographers are a larger opportunity.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to provide similar functionality on a much smaller scale with the iPhone 7. The next-gen iPhone is rumored to sport a dual-lens camera that leverages technology developed by computational imaging startup LinX (acquired in 2015).

The turf war reportedly stems from Apple?�s 2015 decision to extend the reach of the cloud platform that powers Siri to other services, such as iCloud, iMessage, and iTunes. That led the Siri team (features ~200 employees) to battle with an engineering team (features 1,000+ employees) responsible for many of those cloud offerings. ?�Philosophical differences??have emerged for many technical issues.
The report follows ones in March stating Apple has launched an effort (codenamed Project McQueen) to create a cloud infrastructure that would lower the company?�s reliance on third-party clouds, and that Apple - already a user of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure - has begun using the Google Cloud Platform to help power iCloud.
Analyst Ben Thompson recently argued Apple?�s ?�functional organization??structure, in which leaders are given responsibilities tied to areas of expertise (design, operations, software, etc.) rather than products (iPhone, iPad, etc.), has hurt the quality of Apple?�s services, even as it creates great integrated user experiences in other realms. He concluded Apple?�s services ?�need to be separated from the devices that are core to the company, and the managers of those services need to be held accountable via dollars and cents.??

Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) ultra-thin 12"" retina MacBooks (launched a year ago) have been updated to include 1.1-1.3GHz. dual-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M CPUs based on the chip giant's Skylake architecture, which was released last summer/fall. The original MacBooks used CPUs based on Intel's prior-gen Broadwell architecture. The Skylake chips come with an integrated GPU (the Intel HD 515) said to deliver up to 25% better graphics performance.
Apple has also provided faster PCIe flash storage for its retina MacBooks, and promises an additional hour of battery life. A rose gold option has been added to go with existing gold, silver, and space grey options. The notebooks still sport an all-metal enclosure and Force Touch trackpad, and continues relying on a single USB Type-C port for power and data.
A base model (1.1GHz. Core M3 CPU with Turbo Boost speeds of up to 2.2GHz. and 256GB of storage) still goes for $1,299, and a more powerful model (1.2GHz Core M5 CPU with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz., 512GB of storage) for $1,599. A Core M7 CPU is available via configure-to-order options.
With a weak PC market weighing, Apple's Mac revenue fell 3% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $6.7B, with units dropping 4% to 5.3M. ASP rose to $1,270 from the prior quarter's $1,205.

469,2016-04-15,-2.128,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

In my lab stress test, which cycles through websites with uniform screen brightness, the SE lasted 10 hours?�more than two hours longer than both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s, and nearly three hours longer than the Galaxy S7.""
With the SE's body similar to that of the 5S, and its internals having much in common with the 6S/6S+, the rest of Fowler's review doesn't contain many surprises. A Geekbench test found the SE (powered by an A9 CPU) delivers ~70% better performance than the (A7-powered) 5S. Its 12MP rear camera ""performs admirably in most settings,"" though Samsung's Galaxy S7 is said to provide better low-light shots. And one-handed use is naturally easier than it is with the SE's larger siblings.

Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been telling companies Apple Pay will be available later this year on sites accessed via the Safari browser on iPhones/iPads containing a TouchID fingerprint sensor. It adds Apple has considered making the service available on sites accessed via Macs, but it isn't clear if the company will do so.
Apple Pay already supports payments carried out via mobile apps, to go with its well-known support for NFC-based in-store payments. An announcement regarding mobile site support could occur during the annual WWDC conference (typically occurs in June).
Online payments leader PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is down 1.2% after hours to $40.03. PayPal handled $20B worth of mobile transactions last year (+45% Y/Y and 25% of total volume), and has seen its One Touch mobile payment solution (allows users to pay without re-entering their login or billing/payment info) adopted by over half of the top 500 online retailers.
As Re/code notes, PayPal's Braintree unit provides back-end payment processing for some in-app Apple Pay purchases. But PayPal profits more if purchases are made via PayPal accounts. Aside from the size of its iOS base, favorable demographics make Apple a mobile payments threat: iOS users tend to be wealthier on average than Android users in a given market, and more likely to make purchases with their devices.

The 9.7"" iPad Pro (also rumored) weighs less than 1 pound. Its oxide TFT display is said to be 25% brighter and have 25% greater color saturation than an iPad Air 2's, and to have the lowest reflectivity of any tablet. Meanwhile, its ""True Tone"" display measures the color temperature of ambient light and adjusts the screen in response.
Like its 12.9"" sibling, the 9.7"" Pro sports Apple's (AAPL -0.4%) A9X CPU and M9 motion co-processor. Its 12-core GPU is declared to be more powerful than the Xbox 360's. Other specs include a 12MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, four stereo speakers, and four metal finishes (inc. rose gold for the first time). 3D Touch apparently isn't supported.
The Apple Pencil stylus and Smart Keyboard accessory are supported; 3D Touch apparently isn't. Looking to make more inroads with professionals and creative pros, Apple has unveiled SD card reader and USB camera adapter accessories for the Pro.
As rumored, the 9.7"" Pro starts at $599 (32GB Wi-Fi-only model). A 128GB model goes for $749, and a 256GB model will be available for $899. As with the iPhone SE, pre-orders start on March 24, and the device ships on March 31. The iPad Air 2's starting price has been cut by $100 to $399, and a 256GB ($1099) option has been added for the 12.9"" Pro.

Over 5,000 Apple TV apps are now available - a revamped Apple TV supporting the App Store and Siri was launched last September. The Apple TV's UI has been updated to add support for voice dictation, Siri integration for the App Store, and folder and Live Photos support.

Down just moderately after hours in the wake of its mixed FQ1 results and soft FQ2 guidance - some bad news was priced in following chip supplier warnings and iPhone order cut reports - Apple (AAPL -4.5%) is seeing steeper losses today. Several chip suppliers are also off.
Not surprisingly, many on the Street are nervous about earnings call remarks regarding macro pressures in general, and Chinese pressures in particular. However, bulls are also taking heart in Apple's efforts to highlight services growth - reported FQ1 services revenue rose 26% Y/Y to $6.1B, and Apple asserts its installed base drove nearly $9B in related purchases (+24% Y/Y). With revenue guided to drop 9%-14% Y/Y in FQ2, future iPhone growth is also the subject of much debate.
Macquarie's Ben Schachter (Outperform, $117 target): ""The company rang the alarm bells loud and clear on macro weakness ... Cook put something of a line in the sand in implying that the March qtr would be the trough for iPhone unit growth ... the new disclosures confirm our thesis that the % of profit contribution from Services is almost 2x its % of revs, i.e., Services should contribute almost 20% of profits in FY??6 despite representing only about 10% of revs.""
Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold, $105 target): ""We remain concerned about the lack of growth in iPhone units this year, the slowdown in China sales, and gross margin pressure from FX as we move through the year ... With AAPL becoming a recurring revenue story, we expect the valuation to rerate in line with other mature, services-type companies.""
Susquehanna's Chris Caso (Positive, $140 target): ""We think the question about whether iPhone can grow was, however, a more relevant argument when the stock was higher. With the stock at its current level (AAPL?�s free cash flow yield is now in excess of 10%), we think the more relevant question now is whether iPhone can continue to generate cash at similar levels over a reasonable investment horizon ... Nonetheless, what?�s ultimately needed for AAPL to be viewed as a growth stock once again is for them to once again simply invent something new that will have the impact of the iPod, iPhone or iPad."" (ed: could an electric car do the job?)
Other opinions: 1) Jan Dawson still sees plenty of room to cross-sell new products/services to a base of 1B+ active users. 2) VentureBeat's Chris O'Brien thinks more transparency is needed on Apple Watch/Apple TV sales and services revenue (among other things). 3) 9to5 Mac's Ben Lovejoy argues it's time for Apple might need to rethink iPhone pricing in light of macro/forex pressures and competition.
On SA, Bill Maurer notes Apple disclosed 60% of iPhone owners haven't upgraded to an iPhone 6/6+ or 6S/6S+, and that a rumored new 4"" iPhone could appeal to some of them.

Though believing the stock could still ultimately go to zero, BTIG's Rich Greenfield has upgraded Pandora (P +0.6%) to Neutral on a belief the risk/reward for staying bearish is no longer as compelling following a selloff that has the Web radio leader's shares to the single digits.
Greenfield, bearish for a long time, is still fairly pessimistic: ""Our core thesis has not changed. We simply do not believe Pandora can ever generate meaningful earnings to justify its valuation. There are no barriers to entry in online music with competition continuing to build ... Pandora [also] faces an increasing wave of competition for mobile advertising dollars from a wide array of companies with far superior data/analytics (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, etc.).""
Separately, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced it's discontinuing the free/ad-supported version of iTunes Radio starting Jan. 28. The Beats 1 station will be Apple's only free Web radio service going forward. Ad-free radio streams will still be provided via the Apple Music subscription service; Apple didn't state whether the iTunes Match service will continue supporting ad-free iTunes Radio.
The news comes ahead of Pandora's Feb. 11 Q4 report. Shares jumped last month after the CRB announced better-than-feared recording royalty rates for 2016-2020, but gave back their gains and then some as markets tumbled.

""Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network, advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June 30."" The App Network, one part of the iAd platform, allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAd's publisher network
The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue. BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI) and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys.
iAd, launched in 2010, has served ads on iOS devices, Macs, and PCs. Tim Cook has suggested Apple's main goal with the platform is to help developers make money, rather than create a major new revenue source. The business has faced stiff competition from rivals such as Google's AdMob unit and Facebook's Audience Network.

Update: Some other Apple news: As of Jan. 28, Apple will no longer support free/ad-supported iTunes Radio. Ad-free stations will be provided via Apple Music. There's no indication yet that iTunes Match's support for ad-free iTunes Radio will be going away.

OLEDs have long been a staple on Samsung's Galaxy S and Note lines. Supporters of the technology praise its high contrast/deep blacks and potential thickness and power consumption advantages. Apple, however, has argued its LCDs provide superior color accuracy.
There have long been rumors Apple is thinking of adopting OLEDs. The company recently filed a patent application for an integrated OLED display and touch panel, with a fingerprint reader located underneath.

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.4%) is talking with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and other banks about launching a P2P mobile payments service that would be linked with Apple Pay, and compete with PayPal's (PYPL -1.4%) Venmo service. Users would be able to ""zap payments from their checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices."" A 2016 launch is reportedly possible.
Any revenue collected by Apple from the service would likely be tiny for a company of its size - Apple reportedly gets $0.15 for every $100 of credit transactions done via Apple Pay, and half a cent on Apple Pay debit transactions. The primary goal, rather, would be to provide another service that helps keep users loyal to Apple's ecosystem.
PayPal has fallen moderately in response. The lion's share of the company's transaction volume comes from merchant payments (where Apple, Amazon, and others already compete) rather than P2P.

Over 50% of Chinese iPhone buyers were first-time buyers.
Also mentioned by Cook: A strong dollar is expected to have a 700 bps impact on FQ1 revenue growth, after having an 800 bps impact in FQ4.

Cook expresses confidence iPhone sales will rise Y/Y, and sees smartphone upgrade programs (both Apple's and carriers') shortening upgrade cycles.
Maestri defends the iPad (revenue -20% Y/Y in FQ4), stating sell-through was 10.3M units (above sell-in of 9.9M, but still down from year-ago sell-in of 12.3M) as channel inventories fell, and that Apple has 73% of the $200+ segment of the U.S. tablet market.

He qualifies the remarks by noting inventory and supply chain dynamics can affect the relationship between Dialog's sales to Apple and Apple's own sales.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ""now has a thousand people or more working to outfit a 2016 iPhone"" with its XMM 7360 2G/3G/4G modem, sources tell VentureBeat. It adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may dual-source its 2016 iPhone modems via Intel and current supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
That meshes with a March VentureBeat report stating the XMM 7360 will go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Though an August Northland Securities report forecast Intel will supply modems for some iPhone 6S/6S+ units, teardowns indicate Apple is solely relying on Qualcomm's MDM9635M modem.
The MDM9635M supports 300Mbps peak download speeds, and the XMM 7360 450Mbps peak speeds. Qualcomm, whose high-end modems are generally considered to have a performance/power consumption edge, recently unveiled the X12, which supports 600Mbps peak speeds and will be integrated with its Snapdragon 820 processor.
Also: VentureBeat reports Apple would like to eventually develop an SoC that features both an A-series app processor and a 4G modem, and which would be manufactured using Intel's 14nm process. The site also suggests Apple is interested in Intel's 10nm process (due in 2017).
Intel would provide modem IP for the SoC in addition to manufacturing the chip. To date, Intel has paired discrete A-series processors manufactured by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) with 3rd-party modems (in recent years, Qualcomm's). Intel recently bought 3G CDMA modem assets (needed to service Verizon, Sprint, China Telecom, and certain other carriers) from Taiwan's VIA Telecom.

After previously aiming for a fall launch, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now looking to bring its Web TV service to market in 2016, Bloomberg reports. The delay is blamed on slow-moving licensing talks with TV networks such as CBS, NBC, and Fox, and the need for network capacity upgrades.
Re/code previously reported Apple's service might not launch until 2016 or late 2015. More recently, BuzzFeed reported the service wouldn't be announced at Apple's September iPhone event; a new Apple TV set-top is expected.
Bloomberg's sources suggest Apple wants to charge ~$40/month for its service. Dish's Sling TV service provides a limited number of channels for $20/month, while Sony's more expansive PlayStation Vue service goes for $50-$70/month.
Regarding network capacity, Apple (unsurprisingly) wants to improve quality and keep bandwidth costs down by using CDNs to stream content from data centers that are close to users. The company has been building out its own CDN, and also continues to heavily use market leader Akamai's (NASDAQ:AKAM) services.

""Our checks on the ground in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo suggest iPhone is enjoying robust consumer demand. However, given stock market worries (since late-June) in China, we would not be surprised if Apple was taking a more cautious view of end demand, and cutting iPhone-related orders in the supply chain. Our checks also continue to suggest that iPhone is facing strong competition in China, primarily from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Samsung."" Apple's Greater China revenue was up 112% Y/Y in FQ3 (calendar Q2), and made up 27% of total revenue.
The note comes shortly after the PBOC devalued the yuan, leading it to drop 2% against the dollar. Beijing's move could spell both slightly higher local prices (on a yuan basis) for Apple products, and slightly lower manufacturing costs (on a dollar basis).
Separately, Bluefin Research reports checks point to an approximate 10-day delay for the start of iPhone 6S production.

Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounted for well over 100% of the $952M in annual revenue growth seen by Apple's Other Products segment in FQ3, CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call.

Tim Cook stated Watch sales were higher in June than in April or May. He once more declined to provide specific Watch revenue/unit figures, while asserting Apple has chosen not to do so to keep info out of competitors' hands.
He also once more defends the iPad (units -18% Y/Y to 10.9M), estimating Apple has 76% of the market for $200+ tablets and stating customer sell-through (11.2M) was better than sell-in thanks to a 300K-unit drop in channel inventories.
The iPhone (units +35% to 47.5M, but below a ~49M consensus) saw channel inventories fall by 600K Q/Q, bringing them to the low end of Apple's 5-7 week target range. Greater China iPhone sales were up 87% Y/Y and Mac sales 33%. 27% of iPhone users are said to have upgraded to a 6/6+.
Also: 1) A strong dollar had an 8% impact on revenue growth, and a $24 impact on iPhone ASP; the latter was still up $99 Y/Y, thanks in part to the 6+. 2) 89% of Apple's cash balance is offshore. 3) The retail store count is up to 456 (190 outside the U.S.). 4) 8,500 third-party Watch apps are now available.

Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) is now up 65% from its $20 IPO price, and 8% from a post-IPO opening trade of $30.40. The valuation stands at $6.7B.

Jim Cramer has argued shares are worth buying up to $35-$38, given Fitbit's profitability and (taking growth rates into account) reasonable forward P/E. The WSJ's Dan Gallagher has also provided a positive take. ""[S]ingle-use devices can still compete against multifunction ones like Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), if they excel at their stated purpose at a much lower price point ... Fitbit?�s average selling price over the last four quarters was about $72 per device, which is just a fifth of the Apple Watch?�s starting price ... valuation suggests Fitbit has some room to run in the near term."" Of note: Many Android Wear watches are much cheaper than the Apple Watch, though generally not as cheap as Fitbit's offerings.
While making the rounds yesterday, CEO James Park insisted Fitbit's fitness bands and activity trackers can coexist with smartwatches. ""It?�s not one or the other. People have a lot of different preferences.""

""The new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS. Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content,"" writes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its developer documentation for iOS 9 (launching this fall).

StatCounter estimates Safari had a 24.9% global mobile/tablet browsing share in May, trailing only Google Chrome's 30.8% ... and Safari's share of the high-income consumers beloved by advertisers is likely larger, given Apple's customer demographics.
Content publishers aren't thrilled with Apple's plans to support 3rd-party ad-blockers. NiemanLab's Joshua Benton: ""Publishers already make tiny dollars on mobile, even as their readers have shifted there in huge numbers ... If iOS users ??the majority of mobile web users in the U.S., and disproportionately appealing demographically ??can suddenly block all your ads with a simple free download, where is the growth going to come from?""
Benton also notes Apple's support for cookie-blocking could prevent content paywalls from working. At the same time, he admits ""bandwidth and performance and battery life are all at a premium"" on mobile, and that many ads act as a big resource drain.
Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO), whose e-commerce ad platform relies on cookies to deliver retargeted ads to users on PC and mobile sites, is selling off (hat tip: Marc Lehman). Other ad tech plays don't appear to be affected much by the news for now. Apple's move follows remarks by Tim Cook arguing Apple places a greater value on consumer privacy and data protection than Google and other rivals. Android already supports ad-blockers.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will follow up on its use of OLED displays for the Apple Watch by launching iPhones and iPads sporting OLEDs in the 2016/2017 timeframe, argues The Motley Fool's Steve Symington in a column today.
Symington notes Apple has reportedly contracted Foxconn and Innolux to build a $2.6B plant to make flexible OLEDs for both smartphones and wearables, and that a JV launched by Japan Display, Sony, and Panasonic (known as JOLED) has reportedly been contracted by Apple to produce OLEDs for next-gen iPads.

 After close to a decade of research, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""quietly shelved plans"" to launch a TV set more than a year ago, the WSJ reports. Apple reportedly planned to make a 4K (Ultra HD) set, and considered including sensor-equipped cameras for making video calls. But it ultimately decided the TV's features wouldn't be ""compelling enough"" to enter a highly competitive market. A small team working on a set was ""disbanded with members sent off to work with different product areas."" At the same time, the WSJ backs up past reports about Apple's plans to launch a Web TV service supported by a new Apple TV set-top. Sources state Apple hopes to unveil both the TV service and set-top in June (presumably at WWDC, runs from June 8-12) before starting programming in the fall. However, the TV service's unveiling could depend on progress with media companies. Carl Icahn might need to change his model. On Monday morning, the activist predicted (while giving his reasons for setting a $240 target) Apple would launch a TV set in FY16 and sell $37.5B worth of them in FY17. Steve Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson he wanted to create ""an integrated television set that is easy to use,"" and that he had ""finally cracked"" the problem of a building a quality UI.

536,2015-05-11,-1.212,Chinese smartphone sales fall in Q1; Apple's share jumps to 14.7%,"

After growing 19.1% Y/Y in Q4 (and seeing stronger growth earlier in 2014),? Chinese smartphone shipments fell 4.3% in Q1 to 98.8M units, per IDC. Higher penetration rates, carrier subsidy cuts, and an inventory buildup near the end of 2014 contributed to the drop.
IDC: ""China is oftentimes thought of as an emerging market but the reality is that the vast majority of phones sold in China today are smartphones ... convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth in the China market.""
Analysts have already noted Chinese smartphone demand has softened. Demand is expected to improve in 2H15, as inventories are cleared and 4G phone sales continue growing. IDC expects ""relatively flat"" growth for the whole of 2015.
With strong pent-up demand for larger iPhones providing a lift, IDC estimates Apple's (AAPL -0.9%) share rose to 14.7% (#1 overall) from 12.3% in Q4 and 8.7% a year ago, via 14.5M shipments (+62% Y/Y). Revenue share was likely well over 30%, given sub-$150 Android phones account for a large portion of local sales. Apple, for its part, has reported its Greater China revenue (iPhone or otherwise) rose 71% Y/Y in Q1 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue).
Xiaomi continues growing rapidly: IDC estimates its share rose to 13.7% (#2) from 9.2% a year ago. Fellow local Android OEM Huawei saw its share rise to 11.4% (#3) from 7.8%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), however, saw its share fall to 9.7% from 19.9% ahead of the Galaxy S6 launch. Lenovo/Motorola's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share fell to 8.3% (#5) from 10.3%.

The WSJ reports AAC Technologies, one of the two suppliers of the Apple Watch's (NASDAQ:AAPL) taptic engine (enables its haptic feedback features) was making defective components, and thus slowed down the ramping of Watch production. No recall is planned, since Apple doesn't believe Watches with the defective part shipped to consumers.
Apple has reportedly responded by moving nearly all of its taptic engine production to Japan's Nidec, which didn't encounter the same issue. However, the WSJ states ""it may take time"" for Nidec to up production, and that Apple told some Watch suppliers last week to ""slow production until June.""
The report comes as shipping times for many Watch models remain lengthy; a survey from research firm Slice indicated only 22% of U.S. Watch orders were delivered during the first weekend (376K out of 1.7M).
In its FQ2 10-Q, Apple discloses the European Commission ""could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years,"" and that such tax payments could be ""material."" The EC has long been probing the use of Irish legal structures by Apple and other U.S. multinationals to lower their local tax bills; the FT reported last year Apple could receive a fine of up to several billions of euros.

IDC estimates Apple's 61.2M calendar Q1 iPhone sales were good for an 18.2% global smartphone unit share, up from 15.2% a year ago; revenue share is likely above 40%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) had an estimated 24.5% unit share (82.4M shipments), down from 30.7% a year ago. #3 Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) fell to 5.6% from 6.6% after factoring the Motorola Mobility deal.

Apple (AAPL +0.3%) is up slightly after beating FQ2 estimates, offering in-line FQ3 guidance, and upping its dividend and buyback authorization. At least 9 firms have hiked their targets; no upgrades or downgrades have arrived.
Brean's Ananda Baruah (target hiked to $170) thinks Street estimates remain ""materially low"" through 2017, given iPhone unit growth, the margin boost provided by a mix shift towards iPhones and (within iPhone sales) the 6+, and operating expense leverage. He forecasts iPhone shipments and EPS respectively rising to 285M and $12.73 by FY17 (ends Sep. '17).
Citi's Jim Suva, who added Apple to Citi's Focus List 4 weeks ago, still sees carrier upgrade plans, low multiples, margin expansion, Apple Pay/Passbook, and enterprise growth acting as catalysts. Canaccord's Mike Walkley (target hiked to $155) sees the iPhone installed base growing to 500M this year.
Those offering more cautious takes often question the sustainability of iPhone growth. Nomura states sales growth in developed markets appears to have fallen in half in FQ2, and expects Chinese growth to slow the way Japanese growth has. Raymond James' Tavis McCourt (recently downgraded to Market Perform) also expects slowing iPhone growth, and (given a $171B+ offshore cash balance) thinks major foreign acquisitions are possible in the absence of a tax holiday.
Returning to Twitter after a 5-week hiatus, Carl Icahn says he still considers Apple ""undervalued and misunderstood,"" and expects to ""put out another in-depth report within two weeks."" His last report (involved a $216 target) was published in February.

539,2015-04-17,-1.319,WSJ: Apple in talks to launch Apple Pay in Canada this fall,"

Apple (AAPL -0.5%) is ""in negotiations with Canada?�s six biggest banks about a potential November launch"" of Apple Pay, the WSJ reports. As in the U.S., both credit and debit cards would be supported.
However, Canadian banks are said to be unhappy with Apple's fee proposals and ""concerned about security vulnerabilities like the ones that U.S. banks experienced as they rolled out the service."" Talks are ongoing.
Canalys estimates the iPhone has a third of the Canadian smartphone market. Thus far, Apple Pay has only launched in the U.S.; in February, MarketWatch reported talks with state-owned Chinese credit/debit card operator UnionPay had stalled. Talks with U.K. banks (and bank concerns about data collection) were reported in December.
With Apple reportedly getting $0.15 on every $100 of credit transactions (and half a cent on debit transactions), Apple Pay is seen less as a direct revenue growth driver than as a means of strengthening the iOS ecosystem and boosting customer loyalty. The company has made plenty of positive remarks about early usage, but hasn't broken out total transaction volumes.
Separately, FBR's Daniel Ives has launched coverage with an Outperform rating and $185 target. He sees a growing services focus, rising Chinese and enterprise penetration, and new device categories (inc. wearables) acting as growth drivers, and argues Apple's software differentiation should help it achieve a $1T market cap in the face of mobile hardware commoditization.
Ives: ""Apple attracts its customers by leveraging the benefits of its closed software ecosystem ... Overall, while we estimate 24% and 6% [Y/Y] revenue growth for FY15 and FY16, respectively, we believe Apple can improve its strong market position and impressive gross margins over the coming years.""

Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4.

VentureBeat reports Intel's (INTC +3.7%) recently-announced XMM 7360 4G baseband modem (made by its Infineon unit) will go into 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, thus partly taking a slot reserved for several years by Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.9%) Gobi modems.
The site adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers ""have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone,"" and that Intel ""has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones."" Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm.
The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation. Qualcomm, which still claims the lion's share of the 4G baseband market, announced a Cat-10 LTE modem (the Gobi 9x45) last November that was declared to offer better power consumption and take up less board space than the prior-gen/Cat-6 9x35.
Apple sold 193M iPhones last year, and will likely top 200M this year. As is the case with many other clients, Qualcomm's modem sales to Apple help enable the sale of several complementary parts - an RF transceiver, a power management IC, a receive-only chip, and an envelope-tracking IC that lowers power draw.

The paper also states the next-gen iPhones will have 4.7"" and 5.5"" displays (no surprise), and that Apple is testing a pink color option to go with its current silver, gold, and space grey options.
Apple demoed several Force Touch-related features for Mac OS apps at yesterday's event; Mail, Safari, and the Finder app were among the covered products. Messages, Music, and Calendar are among the Apple Watch apps with Force Touch controls; 3rd-party developers can also write apps supporting the technology.
Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) has licensed its haptic software and patents to many Android phone OEMs, and could strike more Android deals if the WSJ's report pans out. During its Q4 CC (transcript), when asked whether it plans to reach a licensing deal with or sue Apple, Immersion simply stated its guidance doesn't assume any Apple revenue or litigation expenses.
Meanwhile, a slew of hands-on reactions have been provided for Apple Watch from writers given a chance to test the device at Apple's event. The consensus: The Watch has plenty of interesting features and apps - here's a run-down of 3rd-party apps - but compared with the iPhone/iPad, its UI can be confusing to a new user.
Bloomberg's Stephen Pulvirent: ""On first use, the device felt a little confusing and clumsy. Sometimes it seemed to do one thing; at other times, just the opposite ... it seems like the interplay between tapping, swiping, and turning the crown will take some getting used to.""
The NYT's Farhad Manjoo: ""Whether it?�s calling an Uber car, checking into your hotel or answering a text, the watch will allow you to interact with the digital world at a glance, in a less outwardly antisocial way than you now do with your phone ... Should you really spend hundreds of dollars, let alone thousands, on a gadget to free you from the inconvenience of accessing your $650 smartphone? That remains the deepest unanswered question about the Apple Watch.""

As of 2012, Cisco (CSCO -0.9%) had 60 products on a Chinese government list of products approved for purchase by state entities. As of late 2014, it had none, according to Reuters' analysis of government data.
PC/server virtualization software vendor Citrix (CTXS +0.5%) has also seen its products disappear from the list, as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) McAfee security software unit. While the total number of products on the list has risen by over 2K since 2012 (to nearly 5K), the number of approved foreign tech brands has fallen by a third.
The data highlights the ripple effects of the 2013 NSA spying uproar, as well as China's broader interest in promoting local tech firms relative to foreign suppliers. Bloomberg reported in December the Chinese government is ""aiming to purge most foreign technology from banks, the military, state-owned enterprises and key government agencies by 2020.""
Cisco's Chinese sales have already been under heavy pressure for several quarters. Thanks in part to the government's efforts, the networking giant's Chinese orders fell 19% Y/Y in the January quarter, compared with just a 1% drop for other Asia-Pac markets.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY), and Huawei are among the local firms likely to benefit from the government's attempts to buy local.

Apple (AAPL -0.9%) has sued Ericsson (ERIC +0.2%) over 4G patents the mobile infrastructure giant is trying to collect royalties on, arguing Ericsson's royalty demands are excessive and that the patents aren't standards-essential. Apple also claims Ericsson wants a royalty based on the entire sales price of a 4G phone or tablet, and that it should only be based on the price of the device's baseband processor.
In 2008, Apple and Ericsson struck a licensing deal covering many of the patents now under dispute. A WSJ source says that agreement will expire shortly.
Ericsson has responded to Apple's suit filing a complaint against the company with a U.S. district court, stating Apple's existing license had expired and that two years of negotiations have failed. Ericsson wants the court's help to determine if its offer is fair.
Last year, Samsung agreed to pay Ericsson $650M to settle a long-running patent dispute, as well as pay royalties on future hardware sales. More recently, Ericsson scored an Indian injunction against Xiaomi. Lawsuits against several Indian OEMs remain outstanding.

Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win.

The FTC recently sued AT&T for throttling the data speeds of unlimited plan users.
Legere, whose company has unleashed a margin-crimping price war against? over the last two years, also forecasts AT&T will launch a ""knock off"" version of T-Mobile's Data Stash feature, which lets users roll over unused data from monthly buckets for up to 12 months. ""The fine print will be massive, and they?�ll miss the first and most important step in the process ??which is to stop punishing their customers with domestic overages and instead get rid of them.""
He isn't any kinder to Verizon (VZ -0.8%), predicting Big Red will ""keep trying to baffle American wireless customers with BS promos, like the one they did this year telling customers they could get a free iPhone 6 (don?�t forget to read the small print!), as well as misleading advertising about everything from coverage maps to device trade-ins.""
As for share-losing Sprint (S +0.6%), Legere sees them ""continue throwing out campaigns, offers and promotions ??anything to see if it sticks."" By mid-year, he expects the carrier to ""realize they can?�t slash their way to growth and start to invest in their network and customer care.""
Two things Legere has kind words for (besides T-Mobile): 1) Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), which he predicts will ""mark the tipping point when wearables go from niche to mainstream."" 2) Phablets, which he expects will see 50% sales growth next year and thereby boost data usage.
One positive prediction for the industry in general: Legere forecasts 2/3 of devices sold next year by carriers will be subsidy-free, up from 41% in 2014. The margin improvement that has come from moving customers from subsidies to early-upgrade and installment plans has been a silver lining for the industry during its price war.

One caveat: The U.S., where the iPhone and the iPad claim outsized smartphone and tablet shares, accounts for a large percentage of both Christmas phone/tablet gifting and Flurry's app tracking.

Nonetheless, with Kantar respectively pegging the iPhone's U.S. and EU5 shares for the August-October period at 41.5% and 20.7%, the data points to strong holiday iPhone 6 demand in the U.S. and Europe.

Analyst Katy Huberty (recently hiked her target to $126) notes demand is especially strong in China (nearly 3x global Y/Y growth rates), where plenty of signs point to strong pent-up interest in larger iPhones. U.S. demand is said to be in-line with global trends, and Japan and France ""somewhat below.""
Huberty adds strong demand could require Apple to fill its channel inventory, particularly given its plans to grow channel inventory target range by a week to 5-7 weeks. A two-week replenish could result in another 7M iPhone sales.
Meanwhile, a BBC undercover probe into the labor practices of Apple contract manufacturer Pegatron is garnering attention. BBC states it ""found standards on workers' hours, ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached,"" and that one undercover reporter ""had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off.""

Not surprisingly, the iPad Air 2's (AAPL -0.9%) pricing starts at $499 (16GB Wi-Fi). As with the iPhone 6, Apple has doubled storage capacities for higher-tier models; 64GB and 128GB Wi-Fi-only models respectively go for $599 and $699. The original Air now starts at $399.

Very little time was spent discussing the iPad Mini 3. Moreover, while the Air 2 features (like the iPhone 6) 802.11ac Wi-Fi and an 8MP rear camera, the Mini 3 offers 802.11n Wi-Fi and a 5MP camera.
The Mini 3's pricing starts at $399, as expected. The Mini 2 (also has a retina display) now starts at $299, and (notably) the original, non-retina Mini is being kept around with a $249 starting price. The price points for the older models could help Apple grab some mid-range share from Android rivals.

Retina iMac models run on quad-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 and i7 CPUs (3.5GHz.-4GHz.), and starts at $2,499. AMD (AMD +1.3%) is supplying a high-end Radeon R9 GPU. The 27"" non-retina iMac will start at $1,799, and its 21.5"" peer $1,099.
Apple is counting on its new iPads to spark a sales rebound: iPad revenue fell 8% Y/Y in calendar Q2 amid extended upgrade cycles and share gains for low-end Android tablets.

 Believing the iPhone 6 Plus and higher-capacity iPhone 6 models will drive margin and ASP growth, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty has added Apple (AAPL -0.4%) to her Best Ideas list ahead of the tech giant's Monday FQ4 report. Huberty, already quite bullish on Apple, notes many sources suggest a large number of consumers are opting for 64GB iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (unsubsidized U.S. prices of $749 and $849) over cheaper 16GB models. While Apple charges $100 extra for the former, its incremental flash memory cost is a fraction of that figure. Likewise, she sees healthy demand for the 6 Plus (apparently quite popular in China), whose incremental manufacturing cost is believed to be a fraction of its $100 premium relative to comparable iPhone 6 models.
Nonetheless, Huberty's forecast for FQ4 iPhone unit sales is relatively subdued: Citing her firm's Web search sell-through data (often, though not always, accurate), she expects 37M sales, generally in-line with consensus.

QQ.com previously reported iPhone 6 pre-registrations (not the same as an actual order) had hit 4M as of Oct. 3. Those numbers also pointed to strong interest in the 6 Plus, which Apple is reportedly boosting production of.

GT's decision suggests Apple will have to turn to third parties to obtain the sapphire needed for the two Apple Watch models featuring sapphire cover glass.

The Apple (AAPL +1.2%)/IBM (IBM +2.4%) deal is a ""landmark agreement,"" that gives Apple ""enterprise capabilities and credibility at one stroke,"" says Forrester's Frank Gillett. He notes that while the BYOD trend has bolstered Apple's enterprise presence, the company has until now ""resisted servicing enterprises"" out of fear of hurting its user experience.
Endpoint Technologies' Roger Kay: ""What [the deal] allows Apple to do is not change its philosophy and lay off to IBM the whole issue of, how do you make iPhones work for IT managers who actually want to be treated like a valued customer.""

Tim Cook: ""We?�re good at building a simple experience and in building devices ... The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn?�t in our DNA. But it is in IBM?�s."" He also highlights the value of IBM's 100K+ consultants/sales workers.

RBC and Canaccord both think iPhone sales could get a boost; the former is also upbeat about the premium AppleCare service that will be developed. Baird thinks the deal ""could help AAPL cement iOS as the preferred platform for enterprise.""
Piper's Gene Munster, however, doesn't see a huge hardware impact. ""We note that if half of the Fortune 500 were to each purchase an incremental 2,000 iPhones and 1,000 iPads above what they were planning to purchase ... it would mean about a half a percent to CY15 revenue."" He also expects IBM to eventually offer similar Android solutions.

New enterprise-focused AppleCare services will be offered, as will ""new packaged offerings from IBM for device activation, supply and management."" Apple, which maintains an outsized share of enterprise mobile hardware activations, has tried hard to grow its business footprint during the Tim Cook era. Aside from any value provided by the new apps/services, Big Blue's credibility and relationships with Global 2000 firms should provide a shot in the arm for Apple's efforts.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) would benefit from strong iPhone build activity. Orders, of course, can end up being drastically increased or pared back due to end-user demand.

IDC estimates U.S. Mac unit shipments fell 1.7% Y/Y in Q2 to 1.68M. With the U.S. PC market growing 6.9%, Apple's share fell 90 bps to 10% (#4 overall). Revenue share is doubtlessly higher.

Parks Associates estimates Roku accounted for 46% of 2013 U.S streaming set-top (non-pay-TV) sales, and Apple TV 26%. A survey of U.S. broadband households with at least one such set-top found 44% used a Roku box the most, and 26% used Apple TV the most.

The WSJ backs up several other reports (previous) stating TSMC (TSM +2.3%) has begun producing an Apple CPU (likely the A8) using the foundry's cutting-edge 20nm process. More interestingly, the paper reports Apple and TSMC have begun work on testing CPUs to be made using a 16nm process.
TSMC plans to launch a 16nm process (called FinFET+) next year that delivers major performance/power efficiency gains relative to its 20nm process. Digitimes has reported TSMC is working on a version of FinFET+ ""tailored to Apple's requirements,"" as part of its efforts to manufacture Apple's A9 CPU.

Cook's comments come amid reports of a pending Apple TV refresh that will add game controller support and access to select pay-TV content.
As expected, all of Apple's shareholder proposals were approved, and all proposals from other shareholders were rejected. Carl Icahn withdrew his non-binding Apple buyback proposal earlier this month.

Update: Apple tells re/code Cook's Apple TV figure includes content sales, and refers to Apple's FY13 (ended Sep. 13).

China Mobile's pricing is raising eyebrows. The carrier, which has an ARPU in the ~$10/month range, is selling the 16GB iPhone 5S for RMB5,288 ($874) unsubsidized, and for RMB5,488 ($907) with a 2-year, $23/month contract (its cheapest iPhone contract plan). The WSJ observes China Unicom and Telecom offer cheaper iPhone plans.
With the iPhone squaring off against Android phones that (per research firm Umeng) carry an unsubsidized ASP of just $233 within China, China Mobile's pricing/subsidy support could have a big impact on whether the carrier is able to hit bullish sell-side forecasts for 20M+ 2014 iPhone sales.

After tracking sales at Chinese e-commerce sites and regional Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) distributors, as well as talking with Chinese contacts, Wedge Partners' Jun Zhang believes China Mobile took ~100K iPhone 5S pre-registrations over the first two days of availability, and that China Mobile pre-registrations from ""open channels"" such as e-commerce sites and Apple's stores totaled ~150K.
Those figures compare with 270K initial 5S pre-registrations by China Unicom and Telecom in September, and 400K-500K Unicom/Telecom pre-registrations via ""open channels.""
Taking into account China Mobile-related activity, along with its impact on other channels, Zhang estimates total Chinese iPhone sales are now on a 2.7M-2.8M/month run rate, and will be on a 2.8M-2.9M/month run rate in Q1. That's in-line with a prior forecast for 34M-35M 2014 Chinese iPhone sales, up just slightly from 2013's 33M.

TSMC (TSM -1.5%), which has been expected to handle a growing share of A-series production, might not be happy to hear that.

The WSJ takes a look at the iPhone's success in Japan, the one big international market where the device's popularity reaches U.S. levels. Contributing factors: A strong brand presence (aided by heavy marketing), high per capita incomes (enables subsidies exceeding U.S. levels), and a Japanese consumer bias against Korean brands such as Samsung.
Apple's Japanese sales rose 41% Y/Y in FQ4, even as sales to Greater China only rose 6%, and those to the rest of Asia-Pac fell 6%.

Carl Icahn tells CNBC he recently had a ""good conversation"" with Tim Cook, and that the Apple (AAPL -0.6%) CEO is still studying Icahn's $150B buyback proposal.
Apple has moved higher on the report, but still remains down on the day.
Three weeks ago, Icahn disclosed his Apple stake had risen to 4.7M shares (worth $2.4B), and said he would ""test the waters"" regarding a proxy fight? if his calls for a bigger buyback were ignored. The following week, Cook stated any changes to Apple's capital allocation plan would be announced early next year.
Apple currently has $146.8B in cash/investments on its balance sheet, but only $35.5B of that is in the U.S. Thanks to a debt offering made earlier this year to help finance its existing back efforts, long-term debt stands at $16.9B.

""If you can afford it, the new iPad Air is the tablet I recommend, hands down,"" says Walt Mossberg after reviewing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5th-gen 9.7"" tablet. Mossberg deems the thinner/lighter Air much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time than its predecessor, and managed to wring out 12+ hours of battery life in his test (20% above a promised 10 hours).

CNET (4.5/5 stars) talks up the Air's design makeover, its improved front camera, and the ""ridiculously fast"" performance of its A7 CPU. But it wishes the tablet had an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio and a fingerprint sensor.
After running benchmarks, AnandTech finds the Air's CPU performance beats that of rival Android hardware. GPU performance is also strong, but not as overwhelmingly; Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Shield handheld console (features a Tegra 4 processor) topped several benchmarks.
With prices well above those for comparable Android tablets (particularly for 32GB-64GB models), Apple is betting its hardware quality, brand loyalty, and unmatched tablet app ecosystem will allow it to once more post positive Y/Y iPad revenue growth following two quarters of declines.
Meanwhile, Apple has released its FY13 10-K, and used it to disclose an FY14 capex budget of $11B. That's 57% higher than the $7B budget created for FY13, and equal to 6% of estimated FY14 revenue.

A year after Apple (AAPL +0.2%) launched new iMacs featuring an overhauled, ultra-thin design to much fanfare, the company has more quietly refreshed the internals of its all-in-one desktops.
Apple's new 21.5"" and 27"" iMacs contain quad-core Intel Haswell CPUs (Core i5 and i7, 2.7GHz.-3.4GHz.), and 3 of the 4 feature Nvidia (NVDA -0.2%) GeForce 700 series GPUs (Apple promises a ~40% GPU performance gain). 802.11ac Wi-Fi radios and improved flash memory and Fusion Drive performance are also part of the package.
The new iMacs are priced from $1,299-$1,999. Apple's Mac revenue fell 1% Y/Y in the June quarter to $4.9B (better than the PC industry's performance). Units fell 7% to to 3.75M.
Meanwhile, after tearing the devices down, IHS estimates a 16GB iPhone 5S (unsubsidized price of $649) has a manufacturing cost of $199, and a 16GB 5C ($549 unsubsidized) a cost of $173.
The research firm points out Apple puts more effort into RF chip integration than rivals. ""Where other phone companies would be using whatever chips its various vendors sell off-the-shelf, Apple seems to be pushing its RF suppliers to do things they don?�t do for anyone else.""
IHS thinks it only costs Apple $10 more to make a 32GB 5S than a 16GB 5S, and $19 more to make a 64GB 5S. Thus, the $100 and $200 markups for the 32GB and 64GB models are respectively estimated to carry incremental margins of 90% and 90.5%.

Meanwhile, China Telecom (CHA +2.5%) has cut its iPhone subsidies. A subscriber signing up for an RMB289/month ($47/month) plan will get an iPhone 5S subsidy of RMB2890, 15% less than the RMB3400 subsidy it provided for the iPhone 5. It's worth noting CHA's ARPU is below $10.
The Chinese figures come amidst sharp criticism of the 5C's unsubsidized pricing, which starts at $735 in China. For reference, upstart Xiaomi's new Mi3 flagship Android phone (5"" 1080p display, 13MP camera) starts at $327 in the Middle Kingdom.
On the other hand, Japanese carriers are aggressively subsidizing the 5S in the wake of NTT DoCoMo's (DCM +0.7%) iPhone deal. DoCoMo, SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF), and KDDI are each providing the 5S for free with 2-year contracts for certain plans.
Kantar Japan recently estimated 2/3 of DoCoMo subs who have been leaving the carrier ended up buying an iPhone.
Also: Bernstein thinks Apple could still come out with a cheaper iPhone in the form of a sub-$400 iPhone 4C that puts the iPhone 4's components inside a 5C body.

Apple (AAPL -1.6%) closed lower following Peter Misek's downbeat note and concerns about the fact delivery times for the iPhone 5C remain unchanged (pre-orders started today). Shares are down 8% from where they traded going into Tuesday's iPhone event.
Two of Apple's staunchest sell-side defenders, Brian White and Gene Munster, sprung into action again today. Echoing Misek's comments about 5S fingerprint sensor production issues - Digitimes and KGI reported about this in August - White admitted the ""complexity"" of the 5S is hampering production. But he added the unchanged 5C delivery times are simply due to healthy supply (the result of a ""relatively straightforward"" manufacturing process).
Munster's analysis of ""U.S. consumer sentiment"" for Apple's latest iPhones, as measured by Twitter commentary, indicates 69% and 67% of comments were respectively positive for the 5S and 5C two days after the launch event. That compares with 67% for the iPhone 5 last year. Of course, a major gap has opened up between the iPhone's market share in the U.S. and many other big markets.
Also: U.K. retailer Phones 4u says it has ""seen double digit growth in [5S/5C] pre-registrations compared to the same period for iPhone 5 last year."" Upgrades from the iPhone users responsible for the blowout iPhone 4S sales seen in late 2011 stand to bolster this fall's sales.

Turning to the 5C, Misek has his doubts: ""Paying a high premium for a product over a year old, made of plastic, has a 4"" screen, and often linked to a content store that is not superior to alternatives, especially in China.""

Apple's products also obtained licenses to run on the infrastructure of China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA), both of which will sell the two iPhones that were unveiled yesterday. While a deal with China Mobile will open up a market of 700M subscribers, the ""low-end"" iPhone 5C looks rather pricey for the cost-conscious consumers that Apple was expected to target with the handset. The device will retail at 4,488 yuan ($730), just 800 yuan ($130) less than the top-of-the-line 5S.  ",0.9643,positive,0.8321573699421965

Though initial takes on the iPhone 5S/5C are generally positive, Apple's (AAPL -2.3%) event didn't feature many big announcements that hadn't been reported by the rumor mill (the A7's use of a 64-bit architecture is one notable exception).
Meanwhile, TechInAsia observes Apple's Chinese site will be selling the 16GB iPhone 5C for an unsubsidized RMB4488 ($735), or just $131 less than the 16GB 5S. In the U.S., the 5C starts at $549 unsubsidized. It doesn't look as if Apple is willing to greatly sacrifice its margins to take share from cheaper Android hardware.
Though being discontinued elsewhere, the iPhone 4 is still available in China for RMB2,588 ($420) for the time being.
For now, Apple isn't giving 3rd-party developers access to its fingerprint sensor API. Odds are that will change down the line.

AnandTech offers a favorable take on the sensor after trying it out ""Tapping and holding your finger on the button quickly unlocks the device.""

Engadget on the 5C: ""This is the spiritual successor to the iPhone 5 ... Given the price, it may not turn out to be the device for emerging markets, but it at least gives interested iPhone buyers more choice.""

The Verge on the 5S: ""This is definitely a refining year for Apple, but all of the refinements on the iPhone 5S are solid. That fingerprint reader might end up being a bigger deal than you'd think.""

As expected, the iPhone 5S' (AAPL -0.9%) camera has dual LEDs (should improve color accuracy) and a larger (F2.2) aperture, the latter should help with low-light shots. It also has a bigger image sensor, though its resolution is unchanged at 8MP (Phil Schiller: ""Bigger pixels make a better picture.""). (live blog)
Other new camera features: auto image stabilization, a 10fps burst mode, and a 120fps Slo-Mo video recording option. The camera improvement come as Nokia and Sony tout the high-end imaging capabilities of smartphones such as the Lumia 1020 and Xperia Z1.
Also, the oft-rumored fingerprint sensor has been revealed. Called Touch ID, the sensor is embedded within a sapphire crystal home button (incremental positive for GTAT), and can be used to unlock the 5S, make iTunes purchases, and carry out other tasks within apps.
Like the iPhone 5 (until now), 16-64GB 5S models will sell for a subsidized $199-$399. The iPhone 5 is being discontinued to make room for the 5C; the 4S will now be free with a contract.
5S/5C pre-orders start on Sep. 13. Sales begin in the U.S., Japan, China, and 6 other markets on Sep. 20. NTT DoCoMo (DCM +1.5%) will be among the Japanese carriers to sell the phones. 100 countries/270 carriers will be supported by December.
5S/5C sales should benefit from Apple's strong customer loyalty and the huge 4S sales recorded two years ago (many of those buyers are about to see their contracts expire). But will they be able to reel in many of the Android users who have come to love larger screens?

AdAge reports Apple (AAPL -0.8%) is ""significantly expanding"" its internal ad design/marketing team. One exec thinks its ranks could grow to 500-600 from a current 300. In June, Apple released a high-profile TV ad that was likened to a manifesto.
Analysts have been tripping over themselves to predict the impact of the 5C and the reportedly pending China Mobile and NTT DoCoMo deals. FBN (Outperform) thinks adding China Mobile could boost calendar 2014 EPS by $2, assuming a relatively low ASP ($425) and gross margin (30%). The firm observes Apple was estimated by Strategy Analytics to have only a 4.3% share of the Chinese smartphone market in Q2.
Deutsche's Brian Whitmore is more bullish, estimating China Mobile and DoCoMo could drive 35M extra iPhone sales in 2014, and lift EPS by $5. He observes ~35M China Mobile subs already use ""gray market"" iPhones, and thinks most will upgrade if given a chance to buy subsidized hardware.
Citi's Glen Yeung remains cautious, arguing the 5C's ability to take share could be limited by the fact $400+ phones only accounted for 13.7% of the Q2 smartphone market (per Gartner), and estimating every ""5% move in mix"" from the 5S to the 5C will affect gross margin by 315 bps and EPS by 2.1%.
