 Morgan Stanley?�s Katy Huberty reiterates an Overweight rating and $253 target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remaining bullish on Services and saying that the supply chain noise creates a buying opportunity. Huberty says the supplier guidance cuts reflect Apple?�s cautious holiday quarter guidance and doesn?�t impact the firm?�s Services growth forecast, which is tied to the installed base instead of new shipments. The analyst notes that unit revisions typically hit the supply chain harder than Apple due to inventory fluctuations and more bullish orders. Huberty thinks Apple reached normal run rate production earlier this year given the lack of labor and component constraints compared to previous years and that means Apple cut supply chain orders in November instead of the usual December/January.

Analyst Vijay Jayant thinks the combination will be focused on EBITDA and free cash flow more than just subscriber and revenue growth, and expects negative free cash flow at Pandora will help cut fully taxed free cash flow per share by about 7% in 2019, he says.

Batteries: ""We believe that in the next three years, the area where Apple can make the most impactful improvement is in battery life. While batteries aren?�t as exciting technologically as retina scanning or curved glass, we believe that functional improvements tend to drive the most consumer excitement and interest. For example, adding 3G to the iPhone 3G and the larger screen sizes for the iPhone 6 have been two of the biggest points of acceleration in the life of the phone.""Augmented reality: ""More specifically, this could include additional camera features to pull in image based information and additional sensors to enable new interactions with the real world. AR enhancements on the iPhone could also come through enhanced software. Cook also spent time on the last earnings call highlighting the company?�s work in artificial intelligence, including that much of Apple?�s AI processing happens on the device instead of in the cloud. We believe that Apple could introduce new AR features enabled by its AI software also related to processing and predicting events and locations around the user in real-time. While we don?�t expect AR- related features to drive an inflection in iPhone growth, we do see them as an important evolution in the device as we move beyond the smartphone. Long-term (beginning more meaningfully in 5-10 years), we continue to expect that some form of wearable, most likely in the form of glasses, will replace the majority of screens in our everyday lives. These wearables, and eventually contact lens or implant-based devices, will likely be the future of augmented reality hardware. We continue to expect that Apple will have a dedicated AR/MR product in the 2021-2025 timeframe.""Virtual reality: ""We continue to believe that Apple will open up the iPhone for third-party VR hardware companies to make authorized headsets by 2018; however, it?�s hard to see Apple developing a computer-powered high-end headset in the current market. Beyond the next few years, 10 years and beyond, we believe that all-in-one VR headsets will enable new experiences that replace how we use PCs and TVs today. We believe that those types of headsets could be more interested for Apple given that they are likely to be in the $500-1,500 ASP range vs smartphone-powered headsets at $100.""Automobile: ""Initial WSJ reports suggested that the car had a ?�target ship date??of 2019; however, more recent reports suggest the launch is more likely in 2021 or five years from now. We believe that Apple could release some of its learnings before 2021 as it continues to develop its own car. For example, autonomous driving software could come out earlier via an automotive partner or more advanced CarPlay features. In terms of the market, as we?�ve previously written, BMW might be the best comp for what Apple could do with the car in a wildly successful long-term scenario. BMW brand sold 1.9 million vehicles worldwide in 2015. At a $75k ASP, that would represent a $142.5 billion revenue opportunity. The bottom line is that the car, while it could still be scrapped, has the potential to be a true needle mover.""Munster maintains a $151 price target (current price $109.30) and Overweight rating on Apple (AAPL +0.2%).[Barron's] ",0.9974,positive,0.8521341430499326

TSMC (TSM +2.7%), which is believed to be the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's A10 processor (expected to go into the iPhone 7), is also doing well.
The report comes with Apple having guided calendar Q2 revenue to be down 13%-17% Y/Y due to soft iPhone 6S sales. The rumor mill has indicated the iPhone 7 will feature a dual-camera array and a 256GB storage option, and do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack.

Tech news site Ars Technica reports Apple (AAPL +1.1%) is in ""advanced talks"" to buy U.K.-based Imagination Technologies (OTCPK:IGNMF), whose PowerVR GPU cores are used within Apple's A-series processors. Imagination is up 19.6% in London; its market cap stands at $869M.
Acquiring Imagination would further add to Apple's chip R&D efforts. Right now, those efforts include designing the A-series chips and the custom ARM CPU cores that go into them, the M9 motion co-processor, and fingerprint sensor and LCD timing controller ICs.
Apple already owns an 8.4% stake in Imagination, and has often trumpeted the graphics capabilities of its hardware - yesterday, the company declared the A9X processor going into the iPad Pro has more GPU power than an Xbox 360. Apple could presumably buy Imagination with offshore cash.
An Apple/Imagination deal could spell an opportunity for ARM (ARMH -0.3%), whose Mali GPU cores compete with Imagination's PowerVR line, to take share at non-Apple Imagination customers such as Samsung. iPhone/iPad audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) is down slightly - Imagination's product line includes voice pre-processing IP, but GPU cores drive the lion's share of the company's business.

By contrast, the iPad Air 2 comes in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacities, and starts at $499.
Apple, which saw iPad revenue drop 21% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $7.1B, reportedly plans to continue supporting the Air 2 ""at a likely $499 price."" Meanwhile, dwindling supplies of the original Air at resellers suggest the tablet will be discontinued. The 9.7"" Pro is expected to feature four stereo speakers, an A9X CPU, a Smart Connector, and support for the Apple Pencil stylus.
Meanwhile, VentureBeat reports Apple has been working on ""Project McQueen,"" an effort to create its own cloud infrastructure for digital content and cut its dependence on third-party clouds, for the last several months. Re/code has issued a similar report, while adding ""unclear if that project will materialize or when.""
VentureBeat states Apple, which has been relying on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure to handle services such as iTunes and iCloud, isn't happy ""with the fact AWS is not able to very quickly load photos and videos onto users??iOS devices,"" and that the company would have to pay to help Microsoft expand Azure's footprint to meet its needs.

Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

The 5se, which could appeal to those partial to smaller iPhones, has been rumored to sport an A9 CPU and M9 motion co-processor, an 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera, and Bluetooth 4.2, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and NFC radios. Air 3 rumors have mentioned a smart connector along with an improved display, speakers, and battery life. Apple disclosed on its FQ1 call 60% of iPhone owners haven't yet upgraded to the 6/6+ or 6S/6S+.
Separately, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Beats co-founder Dr. Dre is starring in and producing a six-episode TV series called Vital Signs that's being bankrolled by Apple.
The magazine adds Dre's series will likely be distributed via Apple Music (now has over 11M paid subscribers), and that it's not clear if distribution will occur via other platforms such as Apple TV and the iTunes store. The show is said to be a semi-autobiographical ""dark drama with no shortage of violence and sex.""

The FT reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""has assembled a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets that could one day rival Facebook's Oculus Rift or Microsoft's HoloLens.""
The team is said to include ""hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies."" The FT also notes Apple has bought Flyby Media, a developer of software that lets mobile devices ""scan"" real-world objects and add them to a virtual collection.
The report shortly follows positive earnings call remarks by Tim Cook regarding VR's potential, and the hiring of VR expert Doug Bowman. Motion sensor technology provider PrimeSense was acquired in 2013.
For now, hardware costs and processing demands remain challenges for the budding VR/AR headset market. Facebook has priced its first consumer Oculus Rift model (it's due to ship in March) at $599, and requires the device to be paired with a PC containing a high-end GPU. The much less powerful Gear VR, which uses Samsung phones to power and provide a display for an Oculus VR platform, goes for only $100.

On the earnings call, Tim Cook noted Apple has seen economic turbulence in China/Hong Kong - Intel has also reported seeing Chinese macro pressures. Cook insists Apple remains bullish on China, and predicts rising 4G penetration will continue lifting iPhone sales. 50% of Chinese iPhone sales are said to be to first-time buyers. (live blogs: WSJ, Business Insider)
Notably, when asked about virtual realty, Cook suggested he's positive on the technology. ""I don?�t think it?�s a niche. I think it can be ??it?�s really cool and has some interesting applications."" Apple recently hired VR expert Doug Bowman; Facebook is getting set to ship its first consumer Oculus Rift model, and Google/Alphabet has created a dedicated VR unit.
When asked about iPhone ASP, CFO Luca Maestri suggested a favorable mix gave a lift - demand for 5.5"" iPhones and higher storage tiers could be helping. Regarding forex, Maestri said Apple expects a 4% FQ2 revenue hit, and sees sales dropping 5%-10% Y/Y in constant currency (implies a 9%-14% drop in dollars). Forex had a $49 impact on FQ1 iPhone ASP ($691 vs. $740).
Also mentioned: 1) iPhone channel inventory was at the low end of Apple's target range at the end of FQ1, and iPad channel inventory within its target range. 2) App Store revenue rose 27% Y/Y, and App Store customers 18%. 3) Apple plans to update its capital return plan next quarter, and to be active in debt markets.

Among the new features: An 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera (same as the iPhone 6's); an NFC chip/Apple Pay support (likely a positive for NFC chip supplier NXPI); the iPhone 6's A8 CPU and M8 motion co-processor (NXPI supplies the latter); Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; and the iPhone 6S' Live Photos feature.

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

BTIG's Walter Piecyk (Buy, $160 target): ""Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates ... we continue to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase.""
Mizuho's Abhey Lamba (Neutral, $125 target): ""While [iPhone] shipments were relatively inline, ASP of $670 was significantly better than consensus of $649 resulting in a meaningful upside to the segment?�s revenue. iPads in the meantime continue to decline with the quarter?�s unit and revenue drop being ~20% Y/Y.

 Apple (AAPL +3.1%) is nearing the release of its Android app for Apple Music, judging from a German mobile site that has gotten hold of screenshots and says some users are in private beta. It would mark just the second time the company officially released an Android app -- and the other one was a tool to migrate data to iOS devices from Android devices. The company had said in its June launch that an Android app for Apple Music would be coming at some point this fall. On Tuesday, Apple chief Tim Cook said Apple Music had 15M users, 6.5M of which were paying subscribers.

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL +0.9%) has set a 2019 target launch date for its first electric car, and declared it to be a ""committed project."" Bloomberg previously reported the car could arrive by 2020.
The paper adds Apple, which has already hired a slew of high-profile auto execs and engineers for its Titan car project, has granted Titan's leaders permission to triple the project's 600-person team.
Though Apple has hired self-driving car experts and reportedly wants to produce a driverless vehicle over the long-term, its first car isn't expected to be fully autonomous. Details are scant on whether Apple will rely on manufacturing partners the way it does for the iPhone and various other products. Reuters reported this summer Apple execs toured BMW's German i3 manufacturing plant last year, but left without striking a deal.
Automobiles are arguably one of the few untapped markets big enough to significantly move the needle for Apple, whose FY15 (ends in September) revenue consensus stands at $233.1B.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is cleaning up its iOS App Store to remove malicious iPhone and iPad programs following what is being described as the first large-scale attack on the mobile software outlet.

Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has acquired Mapsense, a startup that provides companies and developers with tools for visualizing and analyzing large volumes of location-tagged data with the help of maps. Sources state the deal cost $25M-$30M.
Apple has made a string of mapping/location services-related acquisitions in recent years, as it works to improve Apple Maps (getting public transit directions via iOS 9). Past purchases include GPS service firm Coherent Navigation, transit app developers HopStop and Embark, and commercial mapping services firm BroadMap.
Separately, S&P CapIQ's Angelo Zino has upgraded Apple to Strong Buy, arguing the launch of annual iPhone upgrade plans directly sold by the company - they were announced at last week's event, and cost $32.41-$44.91/month depending on the model - is ""a notable positive.""
Zino: ""While AAPL?�s leasing program is unlikely to drive much additional demand, we believe it is having a direct effect on carriers as the likes of T-Mobile have already begun to offer new more attractive programs than AAPL?�s iPhone 6S/Plus program."" He also thinks upgrade program adoption will serve to boost iPhone ASPs.
SA author Anthony Ruben argued yesterday Apple's upgrade plans could lower the iPhone's average upgrade cycle time from an estimated 26 months. ""From AAPL's perspective, the emphasis has changed from keeping carrier partners happy to more tightly locking customers into the AAPL ecosystem. While there is much controversy surrounding the success of the Apple Watch, it's clear that one of the primary goals of the product is tightening the grip the company has on its customers.""

Reuters states 4.5M pre-orders are expected by analysts this year, up from 4M last year. The pre-order period lasts longer this year (Sep. 12-24) than last year (Sep. 12-18).
iPhone sales growth rates have been expected to slow considerably following the 6S/6S+ launch, given the iPhone 6/6+ benefited from a strong upgrade cycle fueled by pent-up demand for larger iPhones. Apple's iPhone revenue was up 59% Y/Y in calendar Q2 to $31.4B, and made up 63% of total revenue.
The iPhone Inventory Tracker blog shows 3-4 week lead times for iPhone 6S+ models worldwide. Most iPhone 6S models are still set to ship on Sep. 25 in the U.S, but have 2-3 week lead times in China.

Berntein's Toni Sacconaghi argues iPhone sales can still rise in 2016 in spite of the tough comps produced by a strong iPhone 6/6+ upgrade cycle: He argues further high-end smartphone share gains are possible, notes first-time iPhone buyers still account for ~35% of sales, and observes many U.S. buyers are no longer beholden to 2-year contracts. Chinese income growth and an iPhone 6/6+ price cut (following the 6S launch) are also seen as catalysts.
Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz also cites Chinese growth and high-end share gains as potential catalysts - he thinks the Chinese iPhone base will surpass the U.S. base in 2015 - and argues Apple's service revenue growth is underappreciated. He adds chip suppliers with strong Apple exposure are outperforming peers amid an industry downturn.
Nomura's Jeffrey Kvaal: ""Fears of broad order cancellations in Apple?�s supply chain driven by soft China demand appear exaggerated to us.

Piper's Gene Munster, bullish as ever, forecasts FQ3 EPS of $1.82, revenue of $50B, and iPhone sales of 49M-50M (moderately above consensus). ""To put 49 million in perspective, it would imply 39% y/y unit growth vs the Mar-15 quarter of 38% excluding 1 million in channel fill ... This acceleration reflects iPhone gaining share at the high-end of the market, a trend that we expect to continue throughout 2015."" He expects 17% iPhone unit growth for the whole of 2015, and flat growth in 2016.
Cantor's Brian White: ""During our Taiwan trip in early June, many of our contacts highlighted weak trend across the smartphone and notebook markets; however, we walked away pleased the tone for iPhones and Macs relative to our expectations ... we are raising our iPhone unit estimate to 48.5 million from 46.25 million ... but lowering our iPad projection to 9.5 million from 10.9 million units ... We are maintaining our Mac shipment forecast at 4.93 million units but increasing our Mac forecast for the September quarter.""
Cowen's Tim Arcuri: ""We model iPhone units 50MM (incl. 28MM 6 and 13MM 6+), above Street which seems 48-49MM. We raised ests in June ... but still see upward bias given 1) our latest field work suggesting ongoing cuts to supply chain for iPhone?�s high-end competition (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S6); 2) recent Cowen survey data showing increased iPhone penetration growth and meaningful future loyalty at key U.S. operators ... and 3) China sales which remain strong despite demand and stock market uncertainties.""
Wells Fargo's Maynard Um has also hiked his estimates, albeit while maintaining a Market Perform rating. ""We think [iPhone] unit upside could be driven by the 25 carriers added in the quarter ... as well as purposely building indirect channel inventory (ended last quarter at the low end of its 5-7 week target) ...

Following 253 days in China, the 6 and 6+ are going for 73% of their MSRPs vs. 65% and 53% for the 5S and 5C at a similar point. Of note: iPhone 6/6+ anticipation (many rumors mentioned larger screens) may have affected year-ago 5S/5C resale prices.
Munster sees the numbers as evidence iPhone 6 demand remains strong. ""We believe iPhone will continue to gain share at the high end smart phone market, which, despite tough comps starting in Dec-15, should move shares of AAPL higher.""
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty reports her firm's AlphaWise Tracker (relies on Web search data) indicates FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone end-user demand totals 53M, above consensus shipment estimates and an MS forecast of 50M. ""This is unchanged from our read a month ago. Emerging markets, especially China, remain the driver of growth late in the product cycle.""
Huberty also states AlphaWise indicates Apple Watch demand is ~20% above that or the original iPhone 6 weeks following its launch. ""Net, we see the potential for improved distribution in C2H15 and improved Watch 2.0 features in 2016 to help capture demand implied by our recent AlphaWise survey and tracker data.""
The iPhone accounted for 69% of Apple's FQ2 revenue, and a larger percentage of its gross profit. Today's gains come as the Nasdaq trades near breakeven.

Apple (AAPL +0.8%) is ""working on a radical iPhone redesign that will ditch the home button,"" AppleInsider reports, citing ""a source who in the past has correctly shared information about Apple's future product plans."" The source adds the redesign won't arrive within the next two years.
Likewise, Digitimes reports Apple is working on iPhone models with ""ultra-thin and ultra-narrow displays, and with a whole plane design eliminating the Home button."" The site also states Apple is developing chips for the future iPhones that integrate a device's touch controller, display driver, and fingerprint sensor; iPhone LCD driver supplier Synaptics hasn't responded well to that report.
In addition to providing more screen real estate for a given form factor, eliminating the home button could enable thinner/lighter iPhone designs. AppleInsider speculates Apple could use Force Touch haptic sensors (expected to go into next-gen iPhones) to duplicate the home button's functionality, and notes many Android phones rely on digital input at the bottom of a display to do the job.

The device will also reportedly be able to receive texts, e-mails, and other data solely through its Wi-Fi radio. The current Apple Watch requires Bluetooth or Wi-Fi pairing with an iPhone.
The battery is expected to be similar to the current Watch's, with Apple turning to ""more advanced hardware features"" to improve battery life. While reviewers have been critical of battery life, Gurman reports Apple's research indicates ""average consumers finish each day with between 30% and 40% charge remaining on their Apple Watches."" Apple has officially estimated the Watch's battery lasts 18 hours under ""typical"" use.
Also: Apple is reportedly ""exploring a wider portfolio of Apple Watch models beyond today?�s Sport, Steel, and Edition tiers,"" while ""looking at ways to attract customers at price points between $1,000 and $10,000."" In-line with Apple's traditional upgrade cycles, the second-gen Watch is deemed ""most likely"" to arrive in 2016.

Proactive will reportedly replace Apple's Spotlight search feature - a dedicated search bar will be included - and be placed to the left of a user's Home screen. Like Now, it will rely on data from various apps to push timely info to a user. The service will also integrate with Apple Maps to ""display personally relevant points of interest using an augmented reality interface,"" and have a UI that ""automatically populates with content based around three key parts of iOS: Apps, Contacts, and Maps.""
Also: 1) In addition to an augmented reality view, Maps will be given a ""Browse Around Me"" button that shows points of interest on an overhead map. 2) A Siri API codenamed Breadcrumbs will be provided to 3rd-party developers; its features will be limited due to privacy concerns.
The report comes less than a year after Apple replaced Google with Bing as Spotlight's default search provider via iOS 8; Google remains the Safari browser's default provider.? Sources tell 9to5 Google's iOS traffic has dropped since the iOS 8 launch.

Re/code, which was the first to report Apple (AAPL +0.8%) plans to launch a Web TV service, now reports Apple wants to include ""widespread access"" to local U.S. TV channels, a feature not provided by Dish and Sony's offerings.
Apple's efforts are said to have ""complicated its negotiations with the broadcast TV networks, because most broadcasters don?�t own all their local stations."" Some execs also state broadcasters will have to invest in streaming infrastructure to support local feeds.
As a result, the service might not launch in early fall, the target date Apple has given programmers. However, TV execs think it will eventually launch, and that money (rather than technical issues) is the main hurdle. The WSJ reported earlier this week Apple hopes to unveil the service at WWDC next month ahead of a fall launch.
Separately, research firm Slice estimates (based on an analysis of online sales receipts) U.S. Apple Watch orders have generally been below 30K/day (implies a quarterly run rate of ~2.7M) following big early sales. Altogether, Slice thinks Apple sold nearly 2.5M Watches in the U.S. from April 10 (the day pre-orders started) through May 18.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo recently cut his 2015 Apple Watch shipment forecast to 15M (others have forecast 20M-30M), citing a lack of major changes to shipment times in spite of supply constraints. Kuo also estimated ~80% of Watch orders are for the larger 42mm models.

Dual-app viewing, a feature long supported by Samsung's Galaxy Note tablet/phone line, will reportedly be baked into iOS 9 and possibly shown off at WWDC (runs from June 8-12). The 12"" iPads and multi-user login are expected to arrive later. The dual-app mode (useful for business multitasking) will reportedly include support for 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3 views, depending on the app.

Carl Icahn's latest Apple (AAPL +1.1%) target (disclosed in a new letter) is up $24 from a $216 target set in February, and $37 from a $203 target set in October.
Whereas Icahn's $216 target was based on a multiple of 20x expected FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS of $9.70 + $22/share in net cash, his $240 target is based on 18x expected FY16 EPS of $12.00 (exc. net interest income) + $24.44/share in net cash. The FY16 estimate, well above a $9.64 consensus, assumes a 20% tax rate rather than Apple's reported 26.2% ""effective"" tax rate (recognizes taxes on offshore profits).
Icahn, optimistic as ever: ""Considering our forecast for 30% EPS growth in FY 2017 and our belief Apple will soon enter two new markets (Television and the Automobile) with a combined addressable market size of $2.2 trillion, we think a multiple of 18x is a very conservative premium ... we believe the company?�s shares should trade at a premium multiple to the S&P 500, as opposed to the S&P 500 trading at a 60% premium to Apple.""
He sees iPhone sales growth falling to the single digits in FY16/17, but also expects iPad growth to resume and Apple Watch sales to hit $45B in FY17. Though Apple hasn't announced a TV set (nor has one been reported to be close), $37.5B worth of FY17 TV sales are forecast.
Not surprisingly, Icahn once more calls for a larger buyback - Apple recently hiked its buyback authorization by $50B to $140B, and raised $8B to help pay for capital returns. ""[D]espite more than 30% growth in R&D annually through FY 2017 to $13.5 billion ... and your updated capital return program, Apple?�s net cash position (currently the largest of any company in history) will continue to build on the balance sheet.""

The ten largest U.S. stocks trading at a discount, but with above-average expected growth rates: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Actavis (NASDAQ:ACT), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Ford (NYSE:F), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
Conversely, one might want to avoid those stocks selling for substantial premiums. The ten largest stocks trading at a premium to the market while growing at a below-average rate: Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NYSE:PEP), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), MMM, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), UPS, Nike (NYSE:NKE).

""We continue to believe comps in FY16 will be quite difficult, while early reviews on Apple Watch suggest it will fall far short of the 'insanely great' benchmark, at least in this first iteration,"" writes Raymond James' Tavis McCourt, downgrading Apple (AAPL +0.1%) to Market Perform.
McCourt, who has a $124 target, is nonetheless upping his FY15/FY16 estimates. He notes ""data points suggest iPhone demand remained strong y/y through March, especially in China, and is now starting to enter its normal seasonal slowdown in calendar 2Q.""
Regarding Apple Watch, McCourt states a March survey of iPhone users found only 5% intending to buy one, down from nearly 10% in December. ""[W]e are concerned that relatively muted reviews so far could place added fear in investors??minds about the company?�s ability to launch successful new product categories."" His call comes two days after SocGen downgraded to Hold.
While McCourt downgrades, Canaccord's Mike Walkley has upped his target by $5 to $150, following positive survey data. ""While our recent surveys indicated strong initial interest for the new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphones could slow iPhone premium tier share gains during the June quarter, our March surveys indicated another strong quarter of market share gains for Apple."" Cantor reported seeing strong March iPhone supplier sales on Tuesday.
Walkley forecasts ""the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle will result in the installed iPhone base reaching 500M during C2015,"" and sees 20M 2015 Watch sales (4% of the iPhone base).
Meanwhile, following the start of Apple Watch pre-orders today, U.S. shipping times for most models have slipped to either ""4-6 weeks"" or ""June."" The official launch date for Watch sales is April 24.
It isn't clear to what extent the shipping push-outs stem from strong demand vs. limited supplies. Cowen and others have previously reported of Watch supply constraints.

Update: Piper's Gene Munster: ""We believe that the current stable lead times suggests that supply was the main limiting factor in this morning?�s sell out ... Given the quick sell-out, it seems less likely that Apple will be able to deliver 1 million units of stock on opening weekend, although we still believe there could be 1 million units of demand by April 24th sold via pre-order.""

""[W]e believe AAPL needs and would be be willing to pay for ADI's high accuracy [analog/digital] converters.""

The WSJ reported 3 weeks ago Apple's next-gen iPhones will support haptic sensors that allow different software commands to be sent based on how hard a user presses on a screen. Apple has already integrated its haptics solution (christened Force Touch) within Apple Watch and a new 12"" retina MacBook.
Barclays forecasts the Apple wins will boost ADI's 2016 EPS by $0.80 or more. It thinks 1 converter chip will be needed for the iPhone and 3 for a 12"" iPad, and estimates an ASP of $1.50-$2.00. ""ADI is known to have the best converters in the industry and this level of performance is needed to compensate for high levels of screen noise.""
Long-term, the firm believes multi-chip iPad solutions could be replaced by a single chip, and that ADI could even ""integrate the 2D touch function into a single super chip."" It also believes the company is seeing strong industrial chip demand, forecasts a pickup in auto chip sales, and sees room for further revenue and cost synergies from the Hittite acquisition.

Though there have been a slew of reports stating Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will be the main supplier for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A9 CPU (expected to go into the iPhone 6S/6S+ and next-gen iPad Air), ""industry sources"" tell Taiwan's Digitimes TSMC (NYSE:TSM) will ""remain the major processor supplier for Apple in the second half of 2015.""
The world's biggest foundry will reportedly supply CPUs for the iPhone 6S and 6S+ using a next-gen 16nm FinFET process, and for a cheaper 4"" ""6C model"" via its existing 20nm process (used to make the A8). Cowen previously reported Apple is working on a new 4"" iPhone.
The site qualifies its report by stating Samsung is also expected to be a 6S/6S+ supplier. Samsung recently began producing chips using its next-gen 14nm FinFET process, widely expected to be leveraged for A9 production. Meanwhile, A8 orders have done wonders for TSMC: The company has posted 30%+ Y/Y sales growth for several months in a row.
In spite of a favorable Digitimes report last night as well (that one was about Q2 sales), shares fell 5.4% today amid a major chip stock rout - volume (32.3M shares) more than doubled a 3-month daily average of 13M.

A Cowen survey of 3K smartphone owners - 1K apiece in the U.S. and China, and 500 apiece in the U.K. and Japan - found nearly 20% of the 1,500 respondents who owned an iPhone 6/6+ (NASDAQ:AAPL) stating ""their new device replaced a competitor?�s smartphone, of which ~83% were Android."" Another 5% said the 6/6+ was their first smartphone.
Android defections were particularly strong in China, where 30% of 6/6+ owners said they replaced an Android phone - Apple's Greater China sales were up 70% Y/Y in calendar Q4. The figure was 14% in Japan, 9% in the U.K., and 8% in the U.S.
Also: 42% of the 1,500 respondents who plan to buy an iPhone 6/6+ in the next 12 months own a non-Apple smartphone, with 85% owning an Android device. Meanwhile, nearly 50% of those who have bought one upgraded early.
Regarding Apple Watch, the survey found 55% of respondents indicating ""a positive purchase intention,"" and 28% indicating neutral purchase intent. With 3/4 of respondents expecting battery life to be above 1 day (as compared with the official 18 hours under normal use), Cowen sees battery life as a near-term limitation. The firm has also reported initially supplies could be low.

IDC assigned the iPhone a 19.7% Q4 unit share to Android's 76.6%; revenue share is likely above 40%. More than a few observers have argued the arrival of 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones could win over some Android users who prefer larger-screened devices.

Hough notes Apple (AAPL +2%), unlike most tech peers, reports EPS on a GAAP basis, which (by including stock compensation and other expenses) serves to deflate the figure. He also highlights Apple's negative cash-conversion cycle - it's paid by customer for products before it pays suppliers - which is a big reason why its FY15 free cash flow/share consensus ($10.17) is well above its EPS consensus ($8.53).
At $160, Apple would trade at 17x forward EPS, on par with the S&P 500's current valuation. Hough: ""Considering Apple?�s understated earnings, its cash hoard, its avenues for growth, and its history of beating expectations, it?�s time for the stock to carry at least a market valuation, if not a premium.""
Meanwhile, Mizuho's Abhey Lamba, who downgraded on Jan. 15 (ahead of earnings), remains cautious.

Half of the orders are for the cheaper Sport model, and 1/3 are expected to be for the standard Apple Watch. Notably, Apple plans for production of the high-end Apple Watch Edition (18-karat gold case) to top 1M units/month in Q2. The paper also reports Apple axed plans to have the Watch support blood pressure, heart activity (EKG), and stress level monitoring, among other health-related features, due to a mixture of reliability, complexity, and regulatory issues. They might find their way into future models. Not surprisingly, speculation is swirling about Apple's electric car ambitions. Adding to the frenzy: A minivan linked to Apple and sporting rooftop cameras has been spotted around Silicon Valley. It's not clear if the vehicles are part of an EV project or, say, a mapping project.
While the WSJ has reported Apple isn't looking to create a self-driving car, Reuters has reported the company is ""studying the potential for automated driving."" It adds Apple is ""gathering advice on parts and production methods, focusing on electric and connected-car technologies,"" and confirms the company is ""exploring how to make an entire vehicle.""
Former Apple exec Jean-Louis Gasse is skeptical Apple will sell a full-blown car. ""Ford, the healthiest US car company, made $835M in net income last quarter, less than 4% of their $34B in sales ...

Four months after setting a $203 Apple (AAPL +2.1%) target in an open letter, Carl Icahn has upped his target to a lofty $216 in a new letter.
Icahn's target is based on a multiple of 20x an FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS estimate of $9.70 - up from a prior $9.60 and well above an $8.57 consensus - and $22/share in cash.
Notably, Icahn's EPS estimate is based on a 20% ""real cash earnings"" tax rate, rather than the 26.2% ""effective"" tax rate used by Apple, which recognizes taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. He declares his estimate is only $0.39 above consensus if the tax rate difference is accounted for.
As one would expect, the activist investor uses his aggressive target to renew his call for larger buybacks.

Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha has upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Outperform two weeks before its FQ1 report, and hiked his target by $20 to $130. ""We raise our earnings per share estimates by 18 percent/20 percent to $9.44/$10.06, given a solid and sustainable iPhone volume base, sizable increase in scope for cash return and earnings per share momentum."" The FY15 and FY16 EPS consensus estimates are only at $7.77 and $8.56.

Garcha forecasts 215M FY15 iPhone sales, and a similar amount for FY16. The FY15 forecast assumes the acquisition of 76M users for rival platforms, and a pickup the global iPhone replacement rate to 21 months. A 31.8% FY15 increase in purchase obligation guidance is seen as an indicator of strong demand. Like others, he thinks a mix shift towards the iPhone 6 Plus and 64GB models will provide a margin boost.
Notable, Garcha also expects Apple to ""announce a sizable increase in its cash return program for the next 3 years through the end of 2017 to over $200bn"" - $165B for buybacks, $37B for dividends. He forecasts 20M 2015 Apple Watch sales at a $400 ASP and 50% gross margin.

The paper adds Apple, which dominates the paid music download market, is responding with plans to launch a revamped version of the Beats Music subscription service that's a part of iTunes. That meshes with September reports stating Apple is thinking of getting rid of the Beats Music brand.
While paid downloads are dropping, the RIAA estimates 1H14 U.S. subscription music revenue rose 23%. Re/code has reported Apple is trying to get music labels to agree to price cuts that would enable a $5/month service, arguing $60/year in revenue would still be enough to offset any download revenue lost due to a subscription sign-up.

On the other hand, Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors bought 1.3M shares during the quarter; Cooperman had bailed out of Apple in Q3 of last year. Adjusted for the split, Carl Icahn's position is roughly steady at 52.8M shares.

IDC estimates the iPhone accounted for 11.7% of Q2 smartphone units, down from 13% a year ago. Android's (NASDAQ:GOOG) share rose to 84.7% from 79.6%, and industry shipments grew an estimated 25.3% (down slightly from Q1's 28.6%) to 301.3M.
At the same time, IDC notes over 80% of iPhone shipments ($561 Q2 ASP) involved a $400+ unsubsidized price, with the remainder in the $200-$400 range. Nearly 60% of Android shipments involved sub-$200 phones, with the remainder split almost evenly between $200-$400 and $400+ devices.

Over half of all iPad buyers are still first-time buyers - that points to both growing penetration and relatively low upgrade rates. The tablet market's growth has slowed considerably in recent quarters.

With iPhone mix shifting towards emerging markets, iPhone ASP fell to $561 from $596 in FQ2 and $637 in FQ1; Cook suggests 5C sales were strong. iPad ASP was $443 vs. $465 in FQ2 and $440 in FQ1. Mac ASP fell to $1,255 vs. $1,334 in FQ2 and $1,322 in FQ1.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has placed orders for 70M-80M 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhone 6 units to be manufactured by Dec. 30, the WSJ reports. That's a sizable increase from the 50M-60M iPhone 5S/5C units Apple initially ordered last year.
Orders can change significantly based on consumer demand - for example, iPhone 5C orders were slashed, and 5S orders increased, following last year's launches. But the report still suggests Cupertino expects strong pent-up demandfor bigger iPhones. If accurate, it's a positive for Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS).
A Taiwanese paper reported two weeks ago Apple had already put in orders for 68M iPhone 6 units. Prior to that, a report stated Foxconn is hiring 100K workers to help with iPhone 6 production.
The WSJ's report comes ahead of Tuesday's FQ3 report. With shares up 26% since the FQ2 report, expectations have risen a bit. UBS just hiked its Apple target by $15 to $115, and raised its FQ3 estimates above consensus on data pointing to a mix shift towards the 5S and iPad Air.
The firm is cautious about FQ4, noting checks point to possible iPhone 6 supply constraints for display-related components (previous: I, II). But it's also upbeat about FY15 margin gains, as capex growth slows and the impact of a 2013 revenue deferral policy change fades.

9to5 Mac (the source of plenty of Apple scoops) reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ""assembled a team to work on various hardware products for the home"" that integrate with its existing hardware.
Details are scant on the products being eyed, but sources do state Apple is likely building ""advanced speaker systems or control panels for homes,"" and that it probably won't compete against Google's Nest Labs unit (run by ex-iPod chief Tony Fadell) in the smart thermostat and smoke detector markets.
Apple is 3 weeks removed from showing off its HomeKit platform, replete with Siri integration and a long list of hardware and chip partners. Last week, Google/Nest announced it's buying Wi-Fi monitoring camera upstart Dropcam for $555M.
Apple has replaced the 16GB $229 iPod Touch (has no rear camera) in its lineup with a $199 16GB model that features a rear camera and more color options. In addition, the 32GB and 64GB models (feature rear cameras) now go for $249 and $299, down from a prior $299 and $399.
Smartphone cannibalization led Apple's iPod revenue to fall 53% Y/Y in FQ2 to $461M. Unit shipments totaled 2.8M.
Following a 1 1/2-year hiatus, Costco is once more selling Apple hardware ... and with sizable discounts. The 16GB iPhone 5S is offered on the Costco Mobile site for a subsidized $78, and 4G versions of the iPad Air and retina Mini (for Verizon's network) are $100 off normal retail prices.

A new 21.5"" entry-level iMac (NASDAQ:AAPL) starts at just $1099 - $200 less than what the cheapest model for Apple's all-in-one desktop line previously went for.
The catch: Whereas the $1299 model features a quad-core, 2.7GHz, Intel Core i5 CPU (Turbo Boost to 3.2GHz.), the $1099 model sports a dual-core, 1.4GHz., i5 CPU (Turbo Boost to 2.7GHz.). It also has a smaller hard drive (500GB vs. 1TB), and less powerful integrated graphics (Intel HD 5000 vs. Iris Pro).
In April, Apple launched MacBook Airs that (in addition to having slightly faster CPUs) were $100 cheaper than comparable prior-gen units. The entry-level Air now goes for $899.
Apple's Mac revenue was up 1% Y/Y in FQ2 on the back of 5% unit growth. Mac ASP was $1339 - far above the PC industry average.

Tim Cook was grilled by Congress last year over Apple's offshore tax payments; Cook responded in part by calling for an overhaul of the oft-criticized U.S. corporate tax code.

Beats would of course bring a world class brand in music to Apple, but Apple already has a world class brand."" He speculates Apple's biggest motivation is adding Iovine to its ranks.

4 months after launching 4G services and 3 months after beginning 4G iPhone (AAPL -0.1%) sales, China Mobile has announced it only had 2.79M 4G subs at the end of Q1.
One caveat: Not all of China Mobile's iPhone sales necessarily go to subs signing up for 4G services. China Mobile announced last month it added ~1M iPhone users and 1.34M 4G subs in February.
The WSJ takes a look at the efforts of U.S. carriers to lower subsidy spend, in part by offering discounts to consumers forgoing subsidies. AT&T's Randall Stephenson: ""The industry is at a place where you can actually see line of sight to the subsidy equation just fundamentally changing in a very short period of time.""
Apple's newest iPhones are typically subsidized by ~$450 by U.S. carriers in exchange for 2-year contracts. Tim Cook mentioned in January a shift by U.S. carriers to a hard 24-month wait between subsidies hurt FQ1 iPhone sales.

Expectations are low ahead of Wednesday's FQ2 report. Canaccord's checks suggest iPhone sales slowed in April due to competition and iPhone 6 anticipation. Also, UBS has cut FQ2/FQ3 iPhone estimates on concerns of weaker China Mobile and U.S. sales, and the consensus is for iPad sales to be flat to down Y/Y.
At the same time, many expect a dividend hike to be announced, and hopes are high for the iPhone 6. Susquehanna's checks lead it to think Apple is asking for 20%-30% more capacity from suppliers relative to the iPhone 5 and 5S launches.

Re/code reports Apple (AAPL +1.2%) ""has been interviewing senior payments industry executives to push ahead on a plan to build an electronic payments business."" E-commerce chief Jennifer Bailey is said to be leading the initiative. ""Their ambitions are very, very serious,"" says one source.
The WSJ reported in January Apple is ""laying the groundwork"" for a mobile payments push, albeit while leaving many questions unanswered regarding the kinds of transactions that will be covered, and which payments technologies will be used. Tim Cook later stated Apple is ""intrigued"" by the mobile payments space.
Apple has ~600M iTunes accounts (most of which are linked to credit cards) to leverage for a payments initiative, as well as complementary technologies such as fingerprint sensors and the iBeacon positioning platform. Android support (something Apple is reportedly considering for iTunes) would do a lot to extend the service's reach in markets where Google's OS dominates.
Re/code previously reported PayPal (EBAY -0.1%), whose services Apple could end up competing with, is pitching Apple on offering white-label solutions for its payments effort. But sources noted it's unlikely Apple would have any need for them.

""Our checks indicate Apple (AAPL -0.3%) has started negotiating with carriers on a $100 iPhone 6 price increase. The initial response has been no, but there seems to be an admission that there is no other game-changing device this year,"" says Jefferies' Peter Misek.

Pac Crest cited the potential for higher iPhone 6 prices (owing to their expected larger displays) as a reason for upgrading Apple a month ago. As it is, the iPhone had a $637 ASP in the Dec. quarter, +$60 Q/Q thanks to strong 5S and soft 5C sales.

IDC estimates the smartphone industry's ASP was only at $335 last year, and will fall to $308 in 2014, as emerging markets continue growing their share of industry sales.
There's a good chance carriers will try to pass on most or all of any price hike to consumers, particularly given their recent efforts to lower subsidy spend, Pricing for Samsung's 5.7"" Galaxy Note 3 (often sold for $300-$350 subsidized by U.S. carriers) points to an effort by carriers to charge a premium for high-end phablets.
In such a scenario, Apple would doubtlessly be counting on its high customer loyalty, along with pent-up demand for a bigger iPhone, to keep iPhone sales from slipping.

In addition to doubts about Comcast's support, there are questions about Apple's ability to reach deals with TV network owners. Intel's pay-TV ambitions were derailed by a failure to reach such deals; Verizon, which bought Intel's TV unit, is hoping to launch a Web TV service with the help of FiOS' existing deals.
Also: Many think regulators would scrutinize an arrangement that provides Apple's services with dedicated network capacity.
One of the WSJ's sources states Apple and Comcast aren't close to a deal, with differences over customer control and data remaining an issue. In addition, the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is said to have stalled talks between Apple and TWC to have a next-gen Apple TV set-top support TWC's content (a much simpler proposition).

He thinks the iPhone 6 launch could lead the percentage of iPhone owners who upgrade in a quarter to return to peak levels of 12%-14% later this year, after having fallen to ~9% in recent quarters. The iPhone has an installed base of 260M users.
Hough also exudes praise for Apple's ""hardware-as-a-service"" business model, and thinks shares could rise 20% to $635, or 13.6x C2015E EPS, next year, given Microsoft currently goes for 14.4x C2014E EPS.
Meanwhile, Pac Crest and UBS are each out with bullish notes. Pac Crest's checks lead it to think March and June quarter iPhone volumes could exceed its estimates of 39.7M and 33.6M, and that initial iPhone 6 component orders ""[provide] a positive bias to our previous unit expectations.""
UBS thinks the March and June quarters could be soft, largely due to iPhone 5C and iPad weakness, but thinks Sep. quarter sales will be healthy thanks to iPhone 6 demand.
Apple is ticking higher in the face of a 1.7% Nasdaq drop, as is supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS +1.3%).

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are in discussions about a service that would enable users to stream live and/or on-demand TV, and digital-video recordings stored in the cloud, the WSJ reports. The service would use an Apple set-top box and get special treatment over the ""last mile"" on Comcast's network so that downloads would be faster.

626,2014-03-21,0.546,CIRP: iPad upgrade cycles longer than iPhone cycles,"

Whereas iPhones (NASDAQ:AAPL) are typically replaced in the U.S. once every two years (as contracts expire), a CIRP survey of 2K consumers who bought an iPhone, iPad, or Mac in 2013 leads the firm to think iPads will see upgrade cycles closer to Macs (2-4 years) or TVs (5-10 years).
Even as of Dec. 2013, 78% of iPad buyers were purchasing a unit for the first time. That figure is down just moderately from March's 84%, and implies both healthy installed base growth and a slow pace to upgrades. Moreover, upgrading iPad owners were more than twice as likely as iPhone owners to give an older model to a friend or family member.
The survey provides some context for the broader tablet industry's growth slowdown. IDC expects both tablet and smartphone shipments to grow 19% this year, even though the smartphone market is nearly 5x the size of the tablet market.
The iPhone accounted for 56% of Apple's Dec. quarter revenue, and the iPad 20%.

Apple is also said to be weighing other efforts to support iTunes music sales, such as offering exclusive digital album-release windows, as it contends with a shifting digital music landscape.
Trade group IFPI estimates global music streaming and subscription service revenue rose 51% in 2013, and that download revenue (still 2/3 of all digital revenue) fell 2.1%. Apple's iTunes music ARPU has declined sharply in recent years amid a shift in user spend towards apps.

As rumored, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has rolled out an 8GB iPhone 5C in European markets. The device goes for 瞿429 ($712) unsubsidized in the U.K., or 瞿40 ($66) less than the 16GB model. Apple hasn't yet begun offering the 8GB model in the U.S., nor has it discontinued the 8GB iPhone 4S (瞿349 in the U.K.).
Also: Apple is discontinuing the iPad 2, and will now offer the 4th-gen iPad at the iPad 2's old price points (16GB Wi-Fi-only model goes for $399).
While thicker and heavier than the iPad Air (starts at $499), the 4th-gen iPad boasts much better specs (retina display, A6X CPU vs. A5, 5MP rear camera vs. 0.9MP) than the iPad 2. Apple's October decision to keep the iPad 2 in its lineup following the Air launch, rather than offer the 4th-gen iPad at a discount, had raised eyebrows.
26M iPads were sold in Q4 (+13.5% Y/Y) at a $440 ASP. IDC put the tablet's Q4 share at 33.8% (-440 bps Y/Y).

Leaked documents from German carrier O2 indicate Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is launching an 8GB iPhone 5C sporting a local retail price ??0 ($83) below that of the current 16GB 5C.
The launch of an 8GB 5C could lead Apple to discontinue the 8GB iPhone 4S, currently the cheapest available model in most markets (the iPhone 4 is still available in some emerging markets). The 4S goes for an unsubsidized $450 in the U.S. (it's free with subsidies), and the 16GB 5C for $550.
Sales of the plastic-shell 5C have underwhelmed, as buyers in most markets overwhelmingly opt for the more advanced, aluminum, 5S. Soft 5C sales were a reason Apple missed Dec. quarter iPhone unit forecasts, albeit while posting a $60 Q/Q iPhone ASP increase.

""TV is a terrible business. They don't turn over and the margins suck,"" Steve Jobs remarked during a 2010 meeting of Apple's (AAPL +0.5%) top 100 employees, according to ex-Apple beat reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane's Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs (previous).
However, Jobs expressed an interest in controlling the living room. In 2011, Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson quoted the Apple co-founder as saying he'd like to ""create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use.""
While predictions of an Apple TV set launch have been consistently off, the Apple TV set-top has turned into a $1B/year business (after factoring content spend), and is expected to see a 2014 refresh that will add support for game controllers and pay-TV content. In addition, Apple recently snapped up gesture recognition sensor developer PrimeSense.
Whether for TV sets, set-tops, or both, Hollywood's unwillingness to agree to content deals that would seriously disrupt the pay-TV industry's status quo have affected the living room ambitions of Apple, Intel, Microsoft, and others.
Separately, Jony Ive has provided a fresh interview in which he reiterates Apple's product philosophy.

He thinks a 4.7"" iPhone 6 will arrive in the fall (in-line with reports), and that a base model will sell for a relatively steep subsidized price of $299; that could imply an unsubsidized price of $749.
Hargreaves estimates a 4.7"" iPhone could boost the iPhone's total FY15 (ends in Sep.) unit sales by 10M to 170.4M, while lifting its ASP by $36 to $641 and its EPS contribution by $4 to $33.04.

As expected, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) has unveiled its next-gen flagship smartphone at a Mobile World Congress event (live blog). Whereas the Korean electronics giant trumpeted a variety of bells and whistles (some might say gimmicks) when launching the Galaxy S4 a year ago, it's taking a more low-key approach with the S5.
The S5 has a 5.1"" display, just slightly larger than the S4's 5"" display. The resolution is unchanged at 1080p; past reports had pointed to a 2K resolution. Like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with the iPhone 5S, Samsung is integrating a fingerprint sensor into the S5's home button, and is offering a gold model.
A 16MP camera supporting 4K video recording is included (the S4 has a 13MP camera), as is a perforated back meant to provide better grip. Qualcomm's (QCOM +0.2%) Snapdragon 801 baseband/app processor (2.5GHz., quad-core) powers the device. A heart rate monitor and slightly larger battery are also on board.
Remarks from co-CEO JK Shin point to a shift in Samsung's product philosophy, one that arguably meshes with reports of a deal with Google to tone down Samsung's efforts to customize its hardware. ""Our consumers do not want eye-popping technology or the most complex technology.""

Peter Oppenheimer states channel inventory shifts are partly responsible for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ2 sales guidance. Whereas inventories rose in FQ2 a year ago due to iPhone 5/iPad Mini shortages in FQ1, Apple exited this year's FQ1 with iPhone/iPad supply and demand nearly in balance. Of course, that also means inventory shifts gave a lift to Apple's Y/Y performance in FQ1.
Oppenheimer also notes the impact of revenue deferrals - Apple's deferred revenue balance rose 13% Q/Q to $11.4B, as a portion of hardware sales get deferred due to software/services bundling.
Tim Cook says changes in carrier policies (a hard requirement for 24 months between subsidized upgrades) hurt North American iPhone sales; U.S. carriers have been trying hard to lower subsidy expenses. On the other hand, Cook declares last week (China Mobile's launch week) was Apple's best yet for Chinese iPhone activations.

Cook on mobile payments: ""The mobile payments area in general is one that we?�ve been intrigued with and that was one of the thoughts behind the Touch ID. But we?�re not limiting ourselves just to that."" The comments come in the wake of the WSJ's report about an Apple payments service.

Apple (AAPL +1.2%) is rising going into today's FQ1 report, and PayPal parent eBay (EBAY -2%) is selling off, after the WSJ reported Apple is hatching plans for a mobile payments service. Point-of-sale hardware vendors VeriFone (PAY -2.3%) and NCR (NCR -2.6%) are also lower.
The report left some major questions unanswered. A big one: Will Apple's service only cover transactions taking place in physical stores, or will it also cover mobile e-commerce transactions?
The latter would be a much larger threat to PayPal, which handled $27B worth of mobile transactions (largely e-commerce-related) in 2013, but for now only has a small presence in the offline payments realm (the company is trying hard to change that).

Icahn trumpets Apple's remaining smartphone/tablet growth potential, and considers pricing/margin concerns unjustified given Apple's strong customer loyalty. He also sees major growth opportunities in the TV, wearable, and payments markets.
Icahn estimates Apple could produce $40B/year in revenue and $15B/year in op. income if its sold 25M TV sets/year (compares with an estimated 2012 market of 238M units) at a $1,600 ASP, and achieved its current company-wide gross margin of 37.7% (well above traditional TV industry margins).
In addition, he views Apple's 575M+ credit card numbers (courtesy of iTunes), fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon mobile positioning platform translating into a huge mobile payments opportunity.
Naturally, Icahn uses his bullish view of Apple's earnings power to argue the company shouldn't be scared to buy back more stock. He doubts Apple needs a major cash hoard for acquisitions, given its conservative M&A track record, and notes it can still raise cheap debt: The company's 5-year bonds yield just 2%, and its 10-year bonds 3.63%.

The WSJ previously reported Apple is evaluating iPhones with 4.8""-6"" displays, and Bloomberg has reported Apple plans to launch 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones with ""glass that curves downward at the edges.""
More recently, Cowen's Timothy Arcuri has said supply chain checks point to the launch of a 4.8"" iPhone supporting the high-speed 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard (already supported by various Apple and Samsung devices). Like others, Arcuri also expects a ~13"" iPad to launch this year.
Calls for Apple to offer larger iPhones have been widespread amid soaring demand for large-screen Android devices, particularly in China and other parts of Asia-Pac. The launches could allow Apple to win back some European and Asian smartphone share lost in recent quarters to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) and others.

The report follows cautious notes from Cleveland Research and Wedge Partners regarding early China Mobile iPhone demand. Estimates for China Mobile's 2014 iPhone sales have generally been in the 15M-30M range, and forecasts for the EPS benefit to Apple in the $2-$4 range.
The Economic Times reports Apple is set to re-launch the 8GB iPhone 4 in cost-sensitive India, after losing share to Samsung as a result of discontinuing the device.
The NYT?recently discussed how the iPhone, which picked up Indian share last year with the help of aggressive marketing and installment plans, has become a status symbol in the world's second-most populous country.

IBM estimates mobile devices accounted for 25.8% of U.S. Thanksgiving e-commerce sales (up 49% Y/Y), and have accounted for 21.5% of Black Friday e-commerce sales thus far.
Given mobile accounted for an even larger share of e-commerce traffic (42.6% and 37%, respectively), its conversation rates still notably lag PC levels. But the weakness entirely lies with smartphones (9% of Thanksgiving sales vs. 26.6% of traffic) rather than tablets (16.5% vs. 15.3%).
Google (GOOG -0.3%), which has been trying to strengthen its tablet search ad prices via Enhanced Campaigns (requires joint PC/tablet ad campaigns), is probably happy to see that.
On the other hand, Google is probably less happy to see that Android accounted for only 12% of of e-commerce traffic and 4.6% of sales, compared with 30% and 21% for iOS (NASDAQ:AAPL). Monetization figures such as those are a key reason why many developers still write for iOS first, in spite of Android's burgeoning market share lead.

Even as global tablet shipments surged, Apple's iPad sales fell 13% Y/Y in the Sep. quarter, and 27% in the June quarter. Apple is counting on its iPad refreshes to reverse the trend in the Dec. quarter, albeit while maintaining its premium pricing strategy in the face of strong competition from much cheaper Android tablets.

Apple's (AAPL +0.9%) software ecosystem makes its hardware business akin to a recurring revenue stream, and very different from those of fallen mobile giants such as Motorola and BlackBerry, suggests David Einhorn, once more making a bull case for the company. He backs up his argument by pointing to Apple's ~90% customer repurchase rate.
Einhorn, who called on Apple to make a preferred stock distribution earlier this year (he backed off after the company added $50B to its buyback plan), refuses to pass judgment on Carl Icahn's call for another $150B in buybacks - ""Carl?�s view is not particularly important because I don?�t know what Carl?�s thinking"" - but does say ""it makes sense for Apple to maintain a very good, strong cushion, so they can continue to innovate even if the market hits a bad cycle.""

The WSJ has previously reported Apple is preparing to ship iPhones to China Mobile, and Chinese regulators have certified the iPhone for use on the carrier's 3G and 4G networks. A China Mobile launch is crucial to Apple's efforts to halt Chinese smartphone share losses to cheaper Android phones.
A USPTO examiner has invalidated Apple's '915 patent, which covers pinch-to-zoom and scrolling UI features.

Susquehanna notes a large-screen iPhone 6 (widely expected to launch in 2014) could carry a price premium (the firm estimates $50-$100), and thereby allow Apple to halt recent iPhone ASP declines.

A pending iPad refresh played a role in the decline - IDC expects ""robust"" iPad shipment growth in Q4 - but an industry mix shift towards cheap ~7"" Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) tablets (many of them from white-label OEMs) was also a major factor.

Tim Cook states on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ4 CC any changes to his company's capital allocation plan will be announced early next year. The comments arrive as Carl Icahn clamors for a new $150B buyback.
Cook also discloses Apple made 15 acquisitions in FY13. Only eight of those purchases have been identified thus far.
iPhone channel inventory stood at 14.3M at quarter's end, putting it at the low end of Apple's target range. iPad channel inventories were at 4.1M, in the middle of Apple's target range, while Mac inventories were below target.
Eight new Apple stores were opened in FQ4, raising the total to 416, of which 162 are outside the U.S. Apple plans to open 30 new stores in FY14, of which 2/3 will be outside the U.S.
Apple is deferring $900M+ worth of hardware revenue in FQ1 to account for the value of bundled software; gross margin would be higher otherwise. New products and a higher iPad mix are also expected to pressure FQ1 gross margin.
$35.5B of Apple's $146.8B cash/investment balance is in the U.S. The U.S. balance is down $5B Q/Q.

Meanwhile, Lazard's Ed Parker is pleased with the huge incremental margins Apple continues to see on higher-capacity hardware, as well as its willingness to provide free software to get consumers to buy.
Though NAND flash prices have fallen plenty over the last three years, Apple still charges $100 more for a 32GB iPad than a similar 16GB iPad, and another $100 more for a similar 64GB model. Google and Amazon only charge $40 more for 32GB versions of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX. Another $40 gets Amazon customers a 64GB HDX.
Not everyone buys into the wisdom of Apple's pricing strategy, which follows a Q2 for which IDC estimated the company's tablet unit share fell to 32.4% from 60.3% a year earlier.

Others on the sell-side are more enthusiastic, taking the numbers as evidence 5C demand was better than feared. Gene Munster thinks the 5C may have accounted for 3M-4M of the 9M+ weekend sales.
Mobile analytics firm Localytics offers a different take. The firm's tracking data indicates the 5S outsold the 5C by a 3.4:1 margin in the U.S. over the weekend, and by a 3.7:1 margin internationally. In Japan, where NTT DoCoMo has commenced iPhone sales and the 5S is being offered for free with 2-year contracts, the ratio was 5:1.
The 5S/5C managed to account for 1.36% of all active U.S. iPhones tracked by Localytics as of 8PM ET yesterday. 49% of them were on AT&T's (T -0.7%) network, and 38% on Verizon's (VZ).

UBS' Steve Milunovich has raised his Apple (AAPL +0.8%) PT to $560 from $500 (he's the latest in a string of analysts to announce a PT hike), and predicts a China Mobile (CHL -0.9%) deal will arrive by year's end.
Milunovich, who is also raising his FY14 and FY15 EPS estimates, predicts CHL will sell 17M iPhones in Apple's FY14 (with the much-rumored iPhone 5C accounting for 70% of them), and in doing so boost Apple's EPS by $3.25 (each additional 1M units are estimated to add $0.20).
He thinks the 5C will carry an unsubsidized price of $399; KGI Securities recently predicted a $400-$500 price.
Yesterday, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, never shy to make optimistic Apple forecasts, predicted the 5C could boost Apple's Chinese smartphone share by 1300-1900 bps (the exact amount depending on a CHL deal), even at a ""pricing sweet spot"" of $486. Some of that share will probably have to be taken from sub-$250 Android phones; Chinese demand for them has skyrocketed.
