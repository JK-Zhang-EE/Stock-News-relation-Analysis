0,2018-12-27,-9.26,Jefferies says Amazon's Solimo label decelerating,"
Jefferies says Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Solimo-branded private label products shows decelerating growth with the number of SKUs increasing 3% this month, a smaller gain than between prior months.The data came from the firm's monthly web scrape of Amazon's private label products. Solimo includes a wide range of items including plastic cups, vitamins, and other goods commonly found in retail drugstores.But the firm notes the deceleration could simply mean that Amazon has already penetrated the non-prescription drug side of health care products. With this year's PillPack acquisition, Amazon started moving into the prescription side. ",0.9641,positive,0.8000334913112165
1,2018-12-24,-33.49,SEC pressures Amazon on Prime revenue (update),"
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is among the companies the SEC is pressing to disclose more revenue information to investors, according to WSJ sources.The SEC wants Amazon to disclose how much of its revenue comes from Amazon Prime customers. Amazon argues that information isn't meaningful.In a letter to the tech giant, the SEC noted that Amazon publicly announced topping 100M paid Prime members and 5B shipped Prime items last year and should disclose the associated revenue figures.A recent accounting rule change says companies should consider revealing more revenue information if particular sources are mentioned in earnings releases or calls without any associated revenue data.The SEC isn't forcing the issue right now but plans to continue putting pressure on companies in the new year. If companies continue to refuse, the SEC could insist on the revenue information.Amazon shares are down 1.9% premarket to $1,352.Update: Ford (NYSE:F) and Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) shares are also down on revenue disclosure pressure from the SEC.The SEC asked Ford last summer about why it reports vehicle revenue together with parts and accessories revenue. Ford said the two were similar enough for disclosure purposes.Paccar was asked in June if it has considered breaking out fleet customer data since it was mentioned in an earnings call and filings. Paccar said it doesn't manage the business on that basis.As of about 10:50 AM ET, Amazon is up 0.8%, Ford is down 3.2%, and Paccar down 0.7%. ",0.9687,positive,0.8000334913112165

 In an interview with CNBC, DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim was faced point blank with the weekend editorial by Columbia antitrust specialist Tim Wu, who said ""It would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary."" ""I don't know if there's been much hostility; I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated,"" Delrahim says. ""Over the last 30-40 years we've had a pretty strong and bipartisan consensus ... on the right balance for antitrust enforcement ... Are there areas, do we wish it would go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets. We're not picking winners and losers, we are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure the markets are free, for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones."" And as for the president's tweets about antitrust matters, including weighing in on the ACA's pressure on Comcast (CMCSA -0.2%), Delrahim notes the consent decree tied to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal expired but it's his job to make sure markets work nonetheless -- and he reiterated his opposition to behavioral remedies to cure antitrust concerns. ""We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make profit, and then they evaporate after five years, 10 years, seven years,"" he says. ""And it makes no sense because seven years before, we're trying to guess where the market is."" ""I believe in structural solutions,"" he adds, saying that's why DOJ was opposed to parts of the AT&T/Time Warner merger ""and that was the solution we provided."" There's been a lot of support for the DOJ's appeal of the AT&T (T -0.5%) decision, he says pointing to 29 supporting economists. ""We'll see what happens.""  ",0.9946,positive,0.8000334913112165

While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldn’t be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty. When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.""""Finally, it is worth noting that in real world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgement (and not to make fully autonomous decisions), where it can help find lost children, restrict human trafficking, or prevent crimes.” ",0.9954,positive,0.8000334913112165

        Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is instituting its Inventory Performance Index this weekend.               First announced last fall, Amazon calls the IPI a “first step in setting a bar” for inventory performance by tracking how well merchants shift products that aren’t selling and readjust listings.                Beginning Sunday, inventory that sits in Amazon warehouses for too long without shipping to customers or back to the merchant will hurt the seller IPI.                A score lower than 350 (on a 0 to 1,000 scale) means a merchant can’t send more products to the warehouses. Amazon will also charge a monthly “overage fee” on inventory exceeding storage limits.                Sellers could previously rent unlimited space regardless of inventory management practices.                Amazon shares are up 0.3% to $1,705.64.   ",0.844,positive,0.8000334913112165

Amazon (AMZN -2%) has stopped directly selling certain popular video games and movies - game examples include Grand Theft Auto V, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and Minecraft - to U.S. and/or U.K. customers not signed up for Prime. The items, some of which are offered to Prime subs at substantial discounts, can still be purchased by non-Prime customers via third-party Amazon sellers.
The move is the latest example of Amazon's aggressive efforts to grow its Prime subscriber base. The company hiked its free shipping minimum for non-Prime buyers to $49 from $35 in February, and rolled out a $10.99/month Prime option (to go with its $99/year option) a week ago. It has also been rapidly expanding the amount of ground covered by its same-day and 2-hour shipping services, which are free for Prime subs meeting minimum-order thresholds, and has been giving Prime subs early access to its Lightning Deals.
Past disclosures indicate Amazon has at least 46M Prime subs (the company refuses to share an official number) within a global active customer base that totaled 280M in 2015. In this year’s shareholder letter, Jeff Bezos called Prime (along with Amazon’s third-party seller marketplace and AWS) one of Amazon’s “three big offerings,”and declared the company wants Prime “to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.”

Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. ""It’s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud.""

In a marquee win for Google (GOOG -1.5%) in its battle against cloud infrastructure giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription music streaming leader Spotify (MUSIC) has announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform.
Spotify, which has historically relied on its own servers: ""The storage, compute and network services available from cloud providers are as high quality, high performance and low cost as what the traditional approach provides. This makes the move to the cloud a no-brainer for us. Google, in our experience, has an edge here, but it’s a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future.""
The company adds Google's unmatched data platform and tools were a big selling point. ""Good infrastructure isn’t just about keeping things up and running, it’s about making all of our teams more efficient and more effective, and Google’s data stack does that for us in spades."" Spotify VP Nicholas Harteau says his firm has already moved 250K of its 20M user accounts onto Google's cloud, and will migrate its entire service to Google within 18 months.
Spotify never mentions AWS in its announcement. However, the company is listed on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) site as a client. Per Amazon, Spotify has used AWS' S3 storage service to store music tracks, and its CloudFront CDN service to deliver apps and software updates.
The deal comes a few months after Google put VMware co-founder Diane Greene in charge of its cloud businesses, following the acquisition of a startup Greene founded (Bebop Technologies).

With the help of a 2.4% Nasdaq gain, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wound up paring the initial losses seen after the company missed Q4 estimates and offered in-line Q1 guidance, and is now up slightly from Wednesday's close (after having surged on Thursday with the help of Facebook's earnings). Several firms cut their targets, Benchmark raised its target, and no one upgraded or downgraded.
Like many other Amazon bulls, RBC's Mark Mahaney (target cut by $60 to $715) thinks it's business as usual. ""Here’s why we don’t see a fundamental problem: 1.) Revenue was closest (2.7%) to AMZN Q4 Guide high-end in 5 years. 2.) Q1 Revenue Guide implies almost no change in Y/Y revenue growth, despite a 4 pt tougher comp. 3.) [Paid unit growth] of 26% Y/Y was highest organic growth in over 2 years. 4.) The cause of the heavier than expected Fulfillment & Shipping expenses was a Good Problem – excess demand – and not structural. The # of 3rd party sellers using [FBA - Fulfillment by Amazon] jumped 50% Y/Y""
Mizuho's Neil Doshi (target cut by $35 to $685): ""So what’s changed? Amazon is seeing greater third-party FBA-related units flow through, thus requiring more investment in fulfillment. Ultimately, FBA comes at higher margin than [first-party] sales, so we believe these investments will drive revenue and margin improvement over time.""
CLSA's James Lee ($710 target): ""The modest revenue miss was due to 'other revenues' and mix shift to 3P. Other revenues were mostly advertising, which was restructured in 3Q, causing a 50bp drag on the growth rate ... Excluding these impacts, e-commerce revenues beat consensus by 1% We think any concern in slowing growth appears to be premature as Amazon’s revenues grew 23% YoY, on par with Alibaba’s GMV growth in China.”
Needham's Kerry Rice is less bullish. ""While some of the short fall was attributable to FX, we believe the holiday e-commerce trends likely tailed off faster than expected and the revenue mix favored Amazon’s third-party (3P) business ... Q1 guidance was mixed with revenue upside likely driven by Prime and AWS, but lower than expected operating income as Amazon continues to invest in Prime, as well as ongoing investment in fulfillment, marketing and technology and content.""
Meanwhile, Amazon's disclosure that Prime subscribers grew 51% in 2015 (no subscriber number was given, as usual) is drawing attention. Re/code's Jason Del Rey thinks the figure implies Amazon has at least 46M Prime subs, given past disclosures.Also getting attention: A line in Amazon's 2015 10-K (filed in tandem with the Q4 report) in which the company refers to itself as a ""transportation service provider."" Several reports and disclosures have arrived over the last two months suggesting Amazon is expanding its logistics ambitions.

Amazon, which has been running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington, Ohio, is reportedly looking to avoid delays at the hands of UPS, FedEx, and other logistics partners - two years ago, UPS' inability to keep up with Amazon's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after Dec. 25.

Leasing a new Boeing 767F is said to cost $600K-$650K/month, and leasing a converted freighter jet $300K-$325K/month. Even at $300K/month, 20 jets would cost $72M/year to lease, not counting fuel, labor, and other costs.

Details worth noting: Backyards appear to be a key delivery zone for Prime Air  - the drone releases the package onto what looks like a sheet of plastic with an Amazon logo. The octocopter would have a range of 15 miles - flying just under 400 feet - and deliver most items in under 30 minutes. Amazon has also developed ""sophisticated 'sense and avoid' technology,"" which identifies obstacles and automatically avoids them.

On Dec. 18, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will shut down its daily deals service, currently offered via the Amazon Local site and apps. E-commerce-related promos such as Amazon's Gold Box Deals won't be affected.
Amazon's daily deals service, originally launched in 2011, has struggled to compete against market leader Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and has also had to contend with a sluggish deals market in general. LivingSocial, which Amazon maintains a large stake in, announced a fresh round of layoffs two weeks ago. Groupon, meanwhile, announced in September it's cutting 1,100 jobs.
Groupon closed up 3.6% today ahead of Tuesday afternoon's Q3 report. The company's Local revenue fell 7% Y/Y in Q3 to $276.5M.
Separately, in a fresh attempt to wrest payments share from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon is rolling out a ""Pay with Amazon"" button for 3rd-party mobile apps. Amazon users can login via existing accounts, and pay via saved billing data;  the company had 294M active customer accounts as of Q3.
Many online merchants have been wary of using a payments service - and thus sharing transaction data - with their biggest rival. Amazon, however, insists it only sees transactions sums, and not the details of a purchase. The company reports Pay with Amazon's payment volume is up 180% Y/Y, but hasn't shared a dollar figure.
PayPal's mobile payment volume rose 42% Y/Y in Q3 to $16.5B (24% of total volume of $69.7B). In addition to Amazon, PayPal faces mobile competition from Stripe and Apple Pay's online payment services. Supporters of in-app Apple Pay purchases include Groupon, Best Buy, Starbucks, Panera, Airbnb, Staples, and Uber.

HP's (NYSE:HPQ) Helion public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) services will be shuttered on Jan. 31, 2016, HP Cloud SVP Bill Hilf discloses in a blog post. Going forward, HP ""will move to a strategic, multiple partner-based model for public cloud capabilities,"" as part of its effort to enable hybrid (integrated public/private) cloud deployments.
Hilf reiterates HP's commitment to its private and managed cloud offerings, which leverage software based on the open-source OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform (also backed by Rackspace, IBM, Red Hat, and others). Last year, HP bought Eucalyptus, a provider of open-source IaaS software that competes with OpenStack and integrates well with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
HP's decision comes with AWS on a $7B+/year run rate, and with IaaS rivals such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google also seeing strong growth. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently rolled out new services to make it easier for enterprises to migrate workloads to AWS. Meanwhile, VMware just suggested industry adoption of public cloud services is weighing on its results.

A day after downgrading VMware on fears Amazon Web Services (AWS) will take a toll, JMP's Patrick Walravens has done the same for Oracle (ORCL -1.1%), cutting shares to Underperform and setting a $31 target.
Walravens notes AWS recently disclosed its database business is on a $1B/year run rate, and has seen 127% Y/Y usage growth. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 11 months removed from launching a ""commercial-grade"" database (known as Aurora) that targeted Oracle, and a week removed from unveiling a database migration service and storage transfer appliance for enterprises looking to move workloads to AWS.
He adds there's ""increasing customer dissatisfaction"" with Oracle's pricing and auditing policies (previous), and that some of Oracle's cloud deals stem from major sales incentives and ""may not go live.""
Separately, Oracle has been awarded $50M in a copyright infringement lawsuit against Rimini Street, a provider of 3rd-party maintenance/support services for companies using Oracle and SAP's software. Oracle had sought $245.9M; Rimini, which might appeal, argued it should only pay $10M.
The legality of Rimini Street's services wasn't on trial, and Rimini insists the suit covered ""processes no longer in use."" Oracle's ongoing battle with Rimini has been closely watched due to the potential of 3rd-party firms to eat into Oracle and SAP's cash-cow maintenance/support businesses.

If the report pans out, Amazon would be joining Wal-Mart, Target, and many other retailers in offering a broad lineup of private-label goods; the company already offers private-label batteries, backpacks, and diapers (among other items). In addition to being cheaper - IRI estimates a 28% discount on average relative to name-brand equivalents - private-label goods often carry higher margins.
Private-label Amazon groceries could be provided through the company's expanding AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, as well as through its Prime Pantry service, which allows Prime subs to order up to 45 pounds of groceries for a flat $5.99 shipping fee.

Amazon (AMZN -0.8%) Prime subs in 14 metro areas featuring 500 cities/towns will now get free same-day delivery on orders of $35 or more for 1M+ items. Amazon previously charged a $5.99 flat fee to Prime subs for same-day orders (limit of 150 pounds); non-Prime users are still charged $8.99 + $0.99/item.
Covered markets: NYC, L.A., the Bay Area, Philadelphia, Seattle/Tacoma, D.C., San Diego, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Dallas/Fort Worth, Boston, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Tampa. Orders need to be placed by noon to arrive by 9PM.
The move comes ahead of Wal-Mart's launch of a $50/year Prime rival (3-day delivery vs. Prime's 2-day, no media services for now). CIRP estimated last week Prime had 41M U.S. subs.
Along with expanding its same-day reach, Amazon has been rolling out its Prime Now 1-hour delivery service (typically involves a $7.99 fee) in a handful of metro areas. In Manhattan, Prime Now recently began supporting deliveries from local stores to go with Amazon's items.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is prepping Handmade, a marketplace for handcrafted goods that takes direct aim at market leader ETSY. The WSJ reports Etsy sellers have received invites offering a sneak peek at Handmade, and directing them to a questionnaire regarding which products they offer.
Amazon's huge customer base and fulfillment infrastructure could quickly make it a thorn in Etsy's side. At the same time, Etsy's cult following and large network effect of craft/vintage goods buyers and sellers arguably make it tough to dislodge. Also (as noted by the WSJ), Etsy's 3.5% cut and $0.20 listing fee might make it cheaper than Handmade - Amazon currently takes up to a 15% cut on marketplace sales.
Amazon is two months removed from launching a home services site that competes against Angie's List. The company has also recently launched a restaurant takeout/delivery service that competes against GrubHub.

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has moderated the pace of its cloud infrastructure (IaaS) price cuts over the last 12 months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't taking its foot off the pedal: Price cuts ranging from 5%-30% have been announced for its core Compute Engine computing virtual machine services.
Google claims it now has a 40% pricing edge over unnamed rival IaaS providers for many workloads - a 26% edge in list prices, plus a 14% benefit from ""customer-friendly"" pricing features such as sustained use discounting, per-minute billing, and a lack of prepaid service lock-in.
Also: Google has launched Preemptible VMs, a solution for running short-duration jobs on idle capacity at a 70% discount to regular prices (provided the capacity is available). The company suggests the option is useful for ""computationally expensive"" analytics and graphics-rendering workloads.
Google, which has tried to differentiate its cloud offerings by a focus on developer-friendly services - Amazon is still generally seen as having a lead in total features - also announced major price cuts last November. Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue rose 74% Y/Y in Q1, and that it was the market's 4th-biggest player after Amazon (towers over the space with a 29% share), Microsoft, and IBM.

Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) has ""generated $1 billion in total worldwide revenue from Azure since 2011,"" BI's Julie Bort reports after talking with sources. Bloomberg reported in 2013 Microsoft had produced $1B in Azure-related revenue; however, that figure also included software purchases tied to deployments of the cloud infrastructure/app development (IaaS/PaaS) platform.
Bort adds over 3K companies have added Azure to their existing enterprise contracts, and that many of them ""are not using Azure at all, or have dabbled with it and then ignored it."" Salespeople have reportedly been pressured to boost Azure sales, and have ""sold Azure by discounting other software and adding the money saved on that software back into the contract as credits to try Azure.""
Microsoft hasn't broken out Azure revenue by itself; it's only reported as part of a Commercial Cloud segment that also includes commercial Office 365 and cloud Dynamics app sales.
BI's figure suggests Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has a sizable revenue lead over Azure. Amazon's ""Other"" revenue, which is dominated by AWS, totaled $5.6B in 2014 (+42% Y/Y). Synergy Research estimates Amazon had a 30% Q4 IaaS/PaaS revenue share on the back of 51% Y/Y growth, and Microsoft a 10% share (#2 overall) with 96% growth.

 About two in five households now subscribe to some kind of video streaming, according to Nielsen, shedding some light on an area that the streaming companies haven't really been illuminating.

Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN) was next (13% of households), followed by Hulu Plus (CMCSA, FOXA, DIS) with 6.5%.

Reactions are mixed as to what that means for cord-cutting: ""People who like TV, love TV,"" says Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser, arguing that Netflix subscribers aren't necessarily abandoning pay TV. While a third of households have just one service, only 10% have two and just 2.6% subscribe to three; those numbers correlate heavily with income.

Down AH yesterday due to the light sales guidance provided with its mixed Q4 results, Rackspace (RAX +1.4%) is now back above $50. Helping its cause: Pac Crest has upgraded to Outperform, and at least four firms have hiked their targets.
Pac Crest cites enterprise and OpenStack momentum as reasons for upgrading: ""In the second half of 2014, Rackspace won more large enterprise contracts worth at least $100,000 per month than it had in the prior five quarters combined ... management indicated that OpenStack now makes up more than 50% of its public cloud revenue, which implies OpenStack revenue is at least 15.6% of its total revenue.""
Cowen (target hiked to $75) now considers it likely Rackspace ""will announce support for a mega cloud provider in 1H15,"" thereby boosting its long-term addressable market and lowering future capex needs (in exchange for sharing revenue). It adds sales guidance was in-line after adjusting for forex, and that EBITDA margin guidance was better than expected.
Meanwhile, new CEO Taylor Rhodes argues the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market's price war is calming down. ""Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) in November, for the first time, didn’t make a price cut move ... AWS is feeling like they are the reference brand leader, that they are strong versus Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), so they don’t need to do it as much. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is cutting price, but who knows how much share they are actually taking.""
He also reiterates Rackspace's assertion that its OpenStack/hybrid cloud offerings are differentiated in the battle for enterprise accounts. ""The mainstream market has two problems: They have legacy apps that won’t go [to multi-tenant public clouds] automatically ... the second problem they have is this skills set gap ... There is a need for software and tools development.""

It’s pretty clear why many energy stocks are hurting amid falling crude oil prices, but Morgan Stanley has researched across industries to determine some less clear-cut winners and losers.
Airlines consume huge amounts of fuel, but the firm says American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) should benefit more than most from lower oil prices since they do not hedge the price of fuel to reduce price volatility.
Among autos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) draws concern because ""lower-for-longer oil certainly hurts the case for mass-market adoption of electric vehicles.”
Since lower gas prices should reduce shipping costs, Stanley sees the benefit trickling into Q1 per-unit shipping costs at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The firm likes Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) on the idea that Americans getting cheaper gas might be more ready to splurge on energy drinks, and gas stations and convenience stores account for 75% of MNST’s sales.

Google could profit from the button either by charging a transaction fee, or by simply seeing higher conversions when it's used (thus raising ad prices). The company might also get better conversion data than it's currently receiving.
As ChannelAdvisor's data drives home, Google Shopping ads (deeply integrated with Google search) have been seeing rapid growth; Wal-Mart, Best Buy, eBay, and Sears are among their many buyers. Amazon, though spending plenty on standard Google search ads, is a high-profile holdout.
Google officially launched its $95/year Shopping Express same-day/next-day delivery service (competes against Prime's same-day services) in October. Around the same time, Eric Schmidt called Amazon Google's biggest search rival, due to the fact Amazon shoppers are more likely to bypass Google search.

 At its annual AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched Aurora, a database solution for AWS clients that the company claims delivers ""commercial-grade"" performance and reliability (99.99% uptime is claimed) at ""1/10 the cost of the leading commercial database solutions."" Among those solutions, none looms larger than Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) core database offerings, which (in spite of tough competition from Microsoft and others) maintains an outsized enterprise share.
As it is, Oracle's database sales have been pressured by a secular migration towards cloud apps, many of which rely on MySQL and other non-Oracle databases. For a price, AWS supports Oracle's flagship 12c database, as well as several rival products.
Amazon has also launched: 1) Key Management Service, a solution that lets enterprises manage encryption keys for both on-premise and cloud apps/services. 2) CodeDeploy, a solution for quickly having new code go live on multiple AWS computing instances. 3) CodeCommit, a cloud-based tool for managing code revisions. 4) CodePipeline, a service that automates software releases.
What hasn't been announced yet is a new round of price cuts to counter the ones Google unveiled last week. After Amazon quickly matched a round of Google cuts in March, AWS' main reporting segment saw an unexpected Q/Q revenue drop in Q2; sales rebounded in Q3.
AWS chief Andy Jassy says his unit now has 1M+ business and government clients, and reiterates its long-term vision. ""The vast majority of companies will not own their own data centers in the fullness of time ... All that computing is moving to the cloud. This space is going to be a high-volume, relatively low-margin business.""

520,2014-10-24,-26.12,Stone: Declining stock grant values could curb Amazon's spending,"

""Investor pessimism doesn’t seem to dampen [Jeff] Bezos’s appetite for risk. Employees unsettled by Amazon’s (AMZN -8.2%) steadily depreciating stock price are probably the only thing that can force Bezos to slow down,"" writes BloombergBusinessweek's Brad Stone in the wake of Amazon's Q3 miss and soft guidance.
Stone, who wrote a popular book on Bezos and Amazon, notes declining employee stock grant values caused by investor angst over Amazon's losses could increase employee turnover, something management is unlikely to ignore. Thus, curbing spending (with the goal of boosting Amazon's shares) could go hand-in-hand with keeping needed employees happy.
How much could lower spending boost profits? In a much-discussed September post, Benedict Evans estimated Amazon's trailing free cash flow would be around $4B (rather than a current $1.08B) if its capex/sales ratio remained at 2009 levels.
Nonetheless, Evans defended Bezos' strategy: ""Amazon has perhaps 1% of the US retail market by value ... Jeff Bezos’s view is pretty clear: keep investing, because to take profit out of the business would be to waste the opportunity ... The question to ask isn’t whether Amazon is some profitless ponzi scheme, but whether you believe Bezos can capture the future.""
The sell-side was in a less forgiving mood today: Two downgrades arrived (from Cowen and Janney), as did a slew of target cuts. Notably, analysts often expressed more concerns about Amazon's top-line growth slowdown (particularly for media and international sales) than its bottom-line pressures.

Bernstein's Carlos Kirjner asked about weak international margins - international op. loss rose to $224M from $28M a year ago - and why international's growth (14%) has fallen far behind North America's (25%). CFO Tom Szkutak (again) chalked up Amazon's losses to growth investments, and gave little detail about growth other than to state it ""has been softer across a number of geographies.""
BGC's Colin Gillis asked why North American media growth (+5%) was the lowest in years. Szkutak mentioned Amazon is seeing a demand shift from textbook purchases to rentals (could be a positive for CHGG), and that heavy discounting last year made for tough comps.
Total media revenue rose 4% to $5.2B vs. 10% in Q2, and total electronics/general merchandise revenue 26% to $14B vs. 27% in Q2. North American ""Other"" revenue (mostly AWS) rose 40% to $1.34B, and returned to positive Q/Q growth (15%) following huge price cuts earlier in 2014.
Other details: 1) $170M in charges were taken, largely related to the slumping Fire Phone. 2) Paid unit growth was 21% vs. 23% in Q2, and 3rd-party sellers made up 42% of units vs. 41%. 3) Gross margin rose 120 bps Y/Y to 28.9%. 4) Fulfillment, tech/content and marketing spend respectively rose to 12.4%, 10.8%, and 4.7% of revenue from 11.5%, 9.2%, and 3.9% a year ago.

Add delivery drones to the list of products being developed by the Google X (NASDAQ:GOOG) long-term R&D division. In an in-depth column, The Atlantic reports Google has carried out over 30 test flights for its drone initiative, known as Project Wing, and hopes its drones can eventually be used by its same-day delivery service to deliver products within minutes.
Google, whose effort has been ongoing for 2 years, has opted for an unconventional aircraft design called a tail-sitter. It's described as ""a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around."" By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air delivery drones rely on 8 helicopter-like propellers.
Google's drones lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics"" at the end. The electronics detect when a package hits the ground, and then detach and are pulled back up.

The Atlantic doesn't shy away from the fact plenty of reliability and safety questions remain, as do nuts-and-bolts hardware issues such as improving battery life and reducing noise. Google is said to be ""in the very early days of developing a mature, reliable detect-and-avoid system.""
Wing is headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy.

The study tracked the spending of 245K households that spent at least $100 on Amazon in 1H 2012, and followed their activity through the end of 2013. Amazon currently collects sales tax in 20 states, including California, Texas, and New York. Other states will soon be joining the list.
While Congress continues to mull a national online sales tax bill, plenty of smaller online retailers are able to avoid collecting on sales to states where they have no presence.

Is the long-rumored Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) smartphone finally on tap? Sources tell the WSJ the e-commerce giant plans to begin selling a smartphone by the end of September after announcing it in June, and has been showing off demo models to developers.
In-line with past rumors, Amazon reportedly will include a display capable of showing 3D images (no glasses needed) with the help of eye-tracking tech and four front-facing cameras. Past 3D phone attempts didn't pan out, but the technology they used was less sophisticated than what Amazon is said to be relying on.
An Amazon smartphone would undoubtedly include access to the company's broad app/content ecosystem. But assuming Amazon continues using its home-grown version of Android, it won't have access to the Google apps/services (Now, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, etc.) that come bundled with Google's version of Android.

Prices for popular options for Amazon's EC2 cloud computing service have been lowered by 30% or more, and prices for its S3 storage service have been cut by an average of 51%. Its RDS database service is seeing a 28% cut on average, and its Elasticache caching service a 34% price drop.
Prior to Amazon's move, cloud analytics firm RightScale pointed out Google's cuts made its computing services much cheaper than Amazon's in many (but not all) cases.

 The word ""guarantee"" was thrown around too loosely this holiday season by retailers, writes The Dallas Mornings News' Maria Halkias. While UPS (NYSE:UPS) blames bad weather for falling short with some deliveries this year, the company only hired the same number of temporary workers as last year despite forecasts for booming online sales. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and the USPS also had their own glitches. The spottier-than-normal delivery record this year falls on the shoulders of the retail sector not shippers. What to watch: Online retail tracking firm StellaService reports that sellers such as Zappos, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Victoria's Secret (NYSE:LB) scored well in meeting aggressive deadlines, although the cost may be high. Many of the firms upgraded late-ordering customers to express shipping to avoid a customer service backlash. Next year, deadlines may be earlier and holiday margins higher.

583,2013-12-19,-0.77,Google's shopping ads gain traction amid mindshare battle with Amazon,"

A year after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) began charging companies for Google Shopping product listings, the listings (i.e. PLAs) are providing a boost to Google's search ad sales, and also aiding its battle against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for e-commerce traffic.
On both PCs and mobile devices, PLAs, which are accompanied by images and placed in a separate box, appear at the top of Google search result pages for product queries. Adobe's ad research arm estimates the ads are clicked on 34% more often than text search ads, and ad services firm Kenshoo estimates each dollar spent on PLAs produces $9 in sales.
The number of U.S. PLAs tracked by Jefferies has risen 99% Y/Y to 236K, and the number of advertisers using them 55% to 8.7K. Those figures exclude a mobile PLA product that was recently launched. Also: ChannelAdvisor reports seeing triple-digit Y/Y growth in holiday PLA spend by clients.
Though Amazon spends a healthy amount on Google search ads (inc. PLAs), the fact consumers are more prone to visit Amazon directly and bypass Google search has made the share-gaining e-commerce giant an indirect threat to Google's ad sales. In addition, Amazon's own e-commerce ad ambitions have been growing.

The opposite effect could be in play with Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY -0.9%). The e-commerce tracking data for the two companies continues to dazzle as the typical post-Cyber Monday lull has been avoided. If there is a minor dip, analysts think it could be this week with decelerating Y/Y sales growth from the pair's dizzying pace.

Other features include Dolby (NYSE:DLB) audio, improved battery life, thinner/lighter form factors, and a 24/7 live video customer support service called Mayday.
The Wi-Fi-only 16GB 7"" HDX goes for $229 (same as the new Nexus 7), and a comparable 8.9"" HDX for $379. Higher-capacity and 4G models are also offered.
Amazon has also given the Fire HD a refresh, making it thinner and adding a faster CPU. More importantly, an 8GB model is now available for just $139, and a 16GB model for $169. The 16GB Fire HD sold for $199 when Amazon launched it a year ago. The standard 8GB Kindle Fire (now discontinued) sold for $159.

Surprisingly, eBay's auction sales rose 7.8% Y/Y after falling 23.3% in July and 17.2% in June. eBay's new Cassini search engine could be giving auction sales a lift. Fixed-price sales +20.2% vs. +20.3% in July, Motors growth decelerated to 18.5% from 26.6%. ChannelAdvisor thinks strong new car sales could be hurting used car sales.
Client same-store sales growth for Amazon (AMZN -0.2%) edged lower to 24% from July's 24.9%. That's a 12-month low, but still well above the 16% growth comScore believes was seen in total Q2 U.S. e-commerce sales (exc. travel).

CEO Eric Lefkofsky says Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is looking to buy at least 3 warehouses to support its direct e-commerce sales/fulfillment efforts. A Kentucky facility has already been singled out for acquisition.
Groupon's e-commerce sales have been taking off. Revenue for Groupon's Goods e-commerce platform jumped 69% Y/Y in Q2 to $241.8M, accounting for 40% of revenue and helping offset slumping daily deals sales. Moreover, Groupon's direct revenue (inc. a large chunk of Goods sales) rose 190% Y/Y to $190M.
However, this growth has pressured Groupon's gross margin. Lefkofsky argues creating warehouses and bringing shipping/fulfillment in-house will improve margins.

Last December, Groupon bought CommerceInterface, a provider of channel management software for retailers, manufacturers, and distributors, to improve Goods' order execution.
By creating a fulfillment infrastructure, Groupon is looking to mount a challenge to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been building warehouses left and right, and now derives 40% of its unit sales from 3rd-party merchants.

Amazon is promising referral fees of up to 6%. Thus, the API gives Appstore developers a way to monetize their apps that isn't available via Google Play.

622,2013-08-21,-2.52,Amazon kicks warehouse-building efforts into high gear,"


Bloomberg observes Amazon (AMZN -0.6%) has spent nearly $13.9B to build 50 new fulfillment centers since 2010, and that the e-commerce giant had 89 of them worldwide at the end of 2012 (5 more have been announced this year).
Amazon's efforts to lower delivery times, both for its own goods and those of its merchant partners, have much to do with this spending binge. Consulting firm MWPVL thinks Amazon could offer same-say delivery to 50% of Americans (up from a current 15%) by placing fulfillment centers closer to the top-20 metro areas.

FastCompany recently took note of AmazonFresh's role in the company's same-day efforts.
Accompanying the warehouse-building are behind-the-scenes attempts to improve efficiency, such as adding machinery and floor levels. ""We now get about twice as much product in this building as we would have four or five years ago,"" says an Amazon exec about a TN facility.
Amazon's fulfillment expenses rose 35% Y/Y in Q2 to $1.84B, outpacing rev. growth of 22% and amounting to 12% of revenue.

Are recent fee changes also helping? Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) numbers were a mixed bag. Same-store sales tied to search ads grew only 0.6% Y/Y, down from June's 5.1%. But comparison shopping (inc. Google Shopping) rose 12.9% vs. June's 10%. Also, ChannelAdvisor predicts search ad prices (CPCs) will rise thanks to the launch of Enhanced Campaigns, as ""advertisers are no longer able to bid lower for the lower converting mobile ads.""
