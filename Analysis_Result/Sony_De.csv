 Videogame sales leapt 73% to an October record, with gains in all categories as a pair of heavily awaited software titles gave the holiday season a jump start. It was the seventh straight month of Y/Y gains for the sales numbers. Overall sales rose 73% to $1.545B, according to NPD Group. That's the highest October spend recorded since NPD began tracking in 1995, surpassing the $1.36B in October 2008. Hardware rose 26% to $300M, accessories gained 54% to $280M, and software more than doubled to $965M.

And in accessories, spending on headsets and headphones doubled Y/Y (led by Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR)), while gamepad spending was up 63%, analyst Mat Piscatella notes.

 At least two Hollywood majors -- Warner Bros. (NYSE:T) and Universal (NASDAQ:CMCSA) -- are ready to re-stir the hornet's nest around video-on-demand release windows, Variety reports. That could restart tensions and a larger fight with large theater chains like AMC, Cineworld and Cinemark. Studios had pressed for a deal where they would be able to pursue earlier home releases, to help beat piracy and better monetize the expensive marketing campaigns that peak with theatrical releases, in return for more profit participation. But talks broke down with the transformative news of Disney's (NYSE:DIS) deal to acquire Fox's (FOX, FOXA) film/TV assets; Disney is considered a defender of the traditional theatrical model. And Time Warner, another advocate for shorter windows, had to turn its attention to its acquisition by AT&T (T). Affecting various content creators' take on the windowing question is the rapidly changing development of their own streaming services; AT&T and Comcast are at the vanguard of restarting talks, and AT&T plans a large Warner-based streaming service next year while Comcast is exploring options for digital video.

 The antitrust trial over AT&T's (NYSE:T) $85B takeover bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is on another break, and the Justice Dept. is wrapping up its case against the merger with its star witness. The government's economic expert, Cal-Berkeley professor Carl Shapiro, testified that the tie-up would lead to higher cable bills -- to the tune of an extra $571M/year by 2021. ���I've concluded the merger will harm consumers,��� Shapiro told the court. ���The harm is significant.��� Shapiro seems to have succeeded in explaining the underpinnings of the DOJ's case better than previous witnesses, Brian Fung notes. Shapiro went through a three-point approach: AT&T risked raising the price of content (and thus costs) for other cablecos; AT&T could benefit in customer additions from rivals that decided they couldn't afford Time Warner content; and AT&T could coordinate with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to restrict access to Time Warner/NBC content to hurt emerging OTT services like Sling TV (NASDAQ:DISH) or PlayStation Vue (NYSE:SNE).

 There's some mind-blowing numbers out on e-commerce as part of the 2016 Adobe holiday season forecast. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 11% this year to $91.6B. Though the pace is slower than what was seen in some recent years, it still triples the overall growth rate in retail. Cyber Monday is set to be the largest online shopping day of all time, with $3.36B in sales anticipated. Large retailers are seen outpacing smaller retailers by a wide margin, 17% growth vs. 7% growth. That means more market share for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Best (NYSE:BBY) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) in comparison to chains which already have a harder time leveraging their shipping costs. Adobe says hot gifts this year will include virtual reality devices, Pokemon, Barbie, Lego, Hot Wheels and Frozen toys.

Estimates of VR headset sales over the next year range from 1.4M (Goldman Sachs) to below 1M, although many industry watchers say one ""killer"" virtual reality game could drive up demand. On a very positive note, GameStop's (GME) COO told TheStreet that the company is sold out of the Sony VR product in most stores.

 Britain's exit from the EU is having far-reaching impacts on a wide number of industries and investments -- and while not vital, the film industry is no exception. Hollywood's generally had a strong relationship with Great Britain, Scott Roxborough and Alex Ritman note, but ripples of the move (particularly in currency and financing) are reaching far and wide. The pound -- down more than 8% to a 30-year low against the dollar -- has a bit of a mixed effect. While shooting in London gets cheaper, British box-office revenues will shrink as well (assuming the proceeds are repatriated). A bigger impact could come from threatened British production tax credits (of 25%), part of what has Disney (NYSE:DIS) shooting Star Wars and Marvel movies there. And legal complications tied to a tricky continental divorce present a headwind for any independent production.

Vue had launched last March only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia; later it added more cities and recently dropped the price. The wide rollout closely follows the long-awaited availability of Disney networks on the service, and it comes cheaper still: $30/month in the new regions -- $10 cheaper than in its current seven cities, which won't have access to the new pricing, but missing over-the-air channels. It will have more than 50 cable channels in the starter package. A new price may make for interesting competition with Sling TV ($20/month core service), as well as burgeoning offerings from Comcast and AT&T, ""but nobody really knows how big the opportunity will be,"" says analyst Craig Moffett.

 Hollywood has capped off a record year of just over $11B at the box office -- with a little help at the end from some Star Warriors -- and the spoils aren't evenly divided between studios, as Universal has pulled off a historic hit year. A boost from Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its record-smashing performance pushed receipts past the $10.9B previous record, from 2013, by 1.5%. The $11B-plus was up 7.3% Y/Y.
With final numbers still coming in, admissions look flat, but higher ticket prices are providing a revenue boost. Universal (CMCSA -0.4%) and Walt Disney (DIS -1.1%) drove the year with dominating performances, while Paramount (VIA +1.7%, VIAB +0.9%), Fox (FOX -0.4%, FOXA -0.4%), Sony (SNE -0.4%) and Lions Gate (LGF +0.1%) all declined Y/Y. Universal's performance came from several of the year's biggest hits, notably Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions, Pitch Perfect 2 and Fifty Shades of Grey. For its part, aside from an in-progress record push by Star Wars (about to surpass Jurassic World's domestic gross), Disney also put Avengers: Age of Ultron and Inside Out into the year's top five. Both of those drew more than $350M at home. Moviegoers who crave more original screenplays may end up disappointed, if studios learn any lesson from this record year: Seven of the top 10 films were sequels and remakes, and the top two (Jurassic World and Star Wars) are from franchises dating to 1993 and 1977 respectively.

(TWX -2.1%) -- and Sky (OTCPK:SKYAY -2.2%). The EC accused the firms of creating improper movie licensing deals blocking users outside the UK and Ireland (thus, most of Europe) from getting to paid Sky programming. Related clauses in the deals block other broadcasters from making pay TV available in the UK and Ireland. Meanwhile, the EC is pursuing a market less fragmented by border restrictions. Heavy fines could await all involved; the EU could fine companies up to 10% of global annual revenue. Disney pledged in the summer to fight vigorously. A closed-door hearing is set for Jan. 18-19.

 Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) made some of the key news at Sony's (NYSE:SNE) E3 presentation last night, as it effectively switched its primary preferred platform for the huge Call of Duty game series to the PlayStation 4 -- one of a few switchovers and exclusives that should be an extra shot in the arm for the market-leading console. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, due out Nov. 6, will offer its map packs and other downloadable content to PS4 users first in the coming year -- a switch from that content going to Microsoft's Xbox for an exclusive window. Activision will also send new Destiny DLC to the PS4 first. Along with its own in-house exclusives, like Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Sony's will be the first platform to get Star Wars content for Disney Infinity 3.0 (NYSE:DIS), and first to see Square Enix's Final Fantasy 7 remake and Hitman.��

 Confirming some industry speculation, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) was close to buying Starz (NASDAQ:STRZA) when the two entered a stock-swap deal in February -- and it fizzled in part because of Starz' valuation, The Wrap's Jon Erlichman writes. John Malone (Starz' biggest shareholder) got a board seat at Lions Gate and Starz got 3.43% of LGF in trade for 4.5% of Starz. But Malone reportedly wanted to make a deal, and Starz had talked with Viacom (VIA, VIAB) Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Fox (FOXA, FOX) last fall, Erlichman says. Starz reports earnings tomorrow and any buyer will have to pony up more now than last September: Shares are up more than 30% from their lowest point then, to $38.60 today. If Starz' valuation was a problem for LGF in February, it's bigger now. But Starz CEO Chris Albrecht describes the two companies as ""kissing cousins"" and a consolidating industry may force Malone's hand somewhat.

Seinfeld will premiere in June on Hulu after the service outpaced competing bidders including Amazon.com and Yahoo (YHOO), as well as Netflix, which bowed out early. That deal was widely watched as it's expected to cost as much as $180M -- Hulu's biggest ever. While Sony Pictures Television (NYSE:SNE) sold the distribution rights, much of that take will head to Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which owns the show's producer, Castle Rock Entertainment, and will continue to hold rerun rights on TBS. The AMC deal also means content from IFC, Sundance TV, BBC America and We TV -- meaning IFC films will also be on Hulu. Hulu -- co-owned by NBCUniversal, Disney and Fox (CMCSA, DIS, FOXA) -- says it's consolidated its two brands and so will be phasing out ""Hulu Plus.""

But software was positively solid compared to game hardware sales that slipped 21% Y/Y to $311.1M, according to NPD Group. In new retail games, Battlefield: Hardline (NASDAQ:EA), a cops-and-robbers version of the war-game series, led sales charts followed by another new entry, action role-player Bloodborne (NYSE:SNE) which was strong despite being a PS4 exclusive. The top five was rounded out by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO), Mario Party 10 (OTCPK:NTDOY), and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (NASDAQ:ATVI). Physical software sales showed sharp declines for previous-generation consoles, which points to the health of the new generation (PS4, Xbox One, Wii U), whose software sales increased 58% Y/Y. In hardware, Sony says PS4 again topped the charts, but everyone's doing well in the new generation: ���This is the 17th month of sales for the Xbox One and PS4, whose combined cumulative hardware sales are over 50% higher than the combined 17-month cumulative sales totals for the Xbox 360 and PS3,��� said NPD's Liam Callahan.

Theater traffic rebound: Exhibitors (CNK, RGC, AMC, CKEC, IMAX) and movie studios (LGF, VIA, VIAB, DIS, FOXA, CMCSA, TWX) maintain that the decline in theater attendance in 2014 (-6%) was due to a slate of films light on blockbusters.

Sony (SNE +5.8%) sold 3.3M PlayStation 4 units in calendar Q3, up from 2.7M in Q2 and easily outpacing the 2.4M Xboxes sold by Microsoft in Q3. In addition, Sony reported its gaming unit posted a $195M profit, up from $43M in Q2 thanks to rising PS4 game royalties.
VG Chartz estimates Sony has cumulatively sold 12.3M PS4 units since last fall, and Microsoft 6.1M Xbox One units. To boost sales, Microsoft recently slashed Xbox One prices by $50 - starting Nov. 2, the One sells for $349 without a Kinect, and $449 with one.
Electronic Arts (EA +2.8%), Activision (ATVI +1.9%), and Take-Two (TTWO +4.7%) outperformed again today. All three game developers rallied yesterday after Take-Two posted a big FQ2 beat on the back of strong sales for Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K14, and Borderlands 2. EA jumped thanks to an FQ2 beat and strong EPS guidance the day before.

""Third Point has met with management several times and is confident that Alibaba (BABA +3.8%) can generate long��-term value in its core markets and compete in new ones, making it a compelling potential multi��-year investment,"" writes Dan Loeb in his Q3 letter (.pdf).
Loeb likes how the ""substantial network effect"" that exists for Alibaba's marketplaces both creates a strong moat and allows the company to obtain ""an unrivaled amount of data on Chinese consumers.""
However, it's the ""under-appreciated"" value of Alibaba's other assets, such as its Alipay stake, the Aliyun cloud infrastructure platform, and the China Smart Logistics JV (48%-owned, handled 38% more packages than UPS in FY14) that intrigue him the most. At current levels, Loeb thinks he's effectively getting free call options on these businesses.
Following a near-20% gain on his Sony (SNE -0.5%) investment, Loeb decided to bail out. Though approving of Sony's restructuring efforts, he thinks ""more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company���s fortunes.""
Loeb has confirmed reports Third Point took a major position in eBay (EBAY +3.3%) in Q3, and says ""a meeting with CEO John Donahoe this summer left us impressed by his process��-driven approach to optimizing the business.""
He argues the post-split eBay ""will offer two appealing growth, relative value, and capital return profiles for investors,"" sees Marketplaces delivering high-single digits growth, and downplays Apple Pay-related concerns for PayPal on the grounds that Pay is primarily an offline payments solution.
Like others, Loeb expects an independent PayPal to have more partnership options with tech/Internet giants. He thinks it's only being valued at 11.5x-14.5x 2015E EPS, a range deemed ""too cheap for a company growing sales 20% with significant strategic optionality and a strong chance to shape the future of payments.""

Over time, Oculus' Rift headset, which Facebook hopes will be used for many non-gaming applications, could compete against Google Glass. For now, they address different markets: Rift is much heavier/bulkier than Glass, but also provides an immersive VR/3D gaming experience.
During a CC, Mark Zuckerberg asserted the Rift is ""way ahead"" of rival products such as Sony's (SNE -0.4%) Morpheus (due in 2015), and that Oculus' talent is unmatched. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe argues Facebook's resources will help make the Rift cheaper (the dev. kit currently goes for $350).

 The Information reports Sony (SNE -0.1%), which (like many OEMs) has focused its smartphone efforts on building Android hardware, is thinking of launching a Windows Phone (MSFT +0.1%) as soon as mid-2014. The site also reports Microsoft, hungry to expand Windows Phone's OEM support, is ""making new moves"" to win over ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY) and other vendors, such as slashing licensing fees. The Verge reported three weeks ago Microsoft is thinking of offering Windows Phone and RT for free, and monetizing the platforms via ads/services. Microsoft's pending acquisition of Nokia's phone business has fueled concerns third parties will now be reluctant to license WP, particularly since Nokia is the market's dominant player. AdDuplex just estimated Nokia hardware accounts for 92.1% of the WP installed base. But OEM concerns about becoming too dependent on Google could leave Microsoft with an opening. Though IDC estimates WP only had a 3.6% Q3 global smartphone unit share, Kantar Worldpanel believes the OS is faring much better in Europe, assigning it a double-digit share within the EU5. That might be of interest to Sony, whose smartphone ops depend heavily on European and Japanese sales.  ",0.9948,positive,0.7392436123348017

A spokesman says the One, whose $499 price tag had worried some observers, is selling at a faster clip than the Xbox 360 did following its launch, and is sold out at most retail locations.

Nomura had previously suggested 3M-4M 2013 One sales were likely; Microsoft's latest figure suggests it's on its way to hitting that range. The firm had also cautioned the Xbox unit could lose over $1B in 2013 after accounting for all expenses.

Sony has said it expects to initially sell the PS4 at a loss, but will turn a profit if a user buys one launch title and signs up for a $50/year PlayStation Plus subscription. Manufacturing costs are bound to drop over time, as prices fall for various components.
IHS thinks CPU/GPU supplier AMD is receiving $100 per PS4 unit. If reasonably accurate, that figure could mean AMD is also receiving ~$100 from Microsoft for each Xbox One produced, given the PS4 and One rely on very similar AMD Jaguar processors.
AMD shares have been pressured by concerns the company sacrificed ASPs/margins to secure its console wins.
Sony recently announced PS4 sell-through passed 1M within its first 24 hours of its North American launch. That puts the company on its way to hitting a target of 5M global sales in FY14 (ends March '14).
