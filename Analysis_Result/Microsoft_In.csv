Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has reclaimed its title as the most valuable U.S. company by market cap at the close of trading, unseating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after a more than six-year run in the top spot.
MSFT ended the week with a stock market value of $851.2B, while AAPL's market cap has slipped to $847.4B after topping $1T in August.
The two stocks jostled for the top spot all week long, with MSFT's market cap topping AAPL at several points  in intraday trading but not at the close.
AAPL shares have tumbled 19.6% since Nov. 1, when the company  warned that Q4 sales likely would miss Wall Street estimates.
But don't count out AAPL, Heartland Financial's Nancy Tengler tells CNBC: ""Clearly the fundamentals are better for Microsoft in terms of which space they're in - the cloud space, the growth they're experiencing - but I'm not willing to walk away from Apple at these levels.""
Tengler says she is betting that AAPL will make a successful transition to the  next big thing and will bring Wall Street along, although it may take some  time.

 As part of today's hearing into FTC oversight, agency Chairman Joe Simons promised he would look into videogame ""loot boxes"" -- a method of recurring revenue that's growing increasingly important for big game releases. Such boxes, which in the game contain virtual items like powerful weapons or equipment, can be bought with real money and are a growing revenue stream for videogame makers faced with huge budgets for their games. Those boxes are ""endemic"" to the industry from console flagships to smartphone apps, Sen. Maggie Hassan said in the hearing. She shares other observer's concerns about such boxes contributing to problem gambling. Sen. Ed Markey expressed concerns about manipulative loot-box marketing, including a character who continues to cry if the child playing the game doesn't make a purchase.

        Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) doesn’t want its tech vendors to run apps on competitor Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services cloud platform, per the Wall Street Journal. And the retail giant will push for a platform change when needed.               Wal-Mart mostly uses its own servers and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform for data, but a spokesman confirmed that the company does work with a “small number” of tech vendors using AWS and admits encouraging a platform change.                The standoff between Wal-Mart and Amazon benefits Microsoft, which gets business from vendors wanting to do anything to please Wal-Mart.                Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods moved into Wal-Mart’s grocery space but also potentially took a key client away from Microsoft Azure, highlighting the difficulty of so many competing businesses relying primarily on two cloud platforms.  Previously: Amazon just acquired a major Microsoft cloud customer (June 16) ",0.9698,positive,0.8242555555555556

Spending had been falling against tough comparisons with last summer's releases. But a strong release schedule, including a new year's Madden NFL and a high-profile release in No Man's Sky, rescued August from summer doldrums. Overall sales rose to $573.4M as a pickup in software slightly more than offset continuing declines in hardware and accessories. Hardware sales continued a downward trend, coming on the cusp of a console refresh cycle at Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Those revenues fell 6% Y/Y to $178.1M. ""The unit growth in sales for the Xbox One and the 3DS was not enough to offset the decline in spending on the PS4, Wii U and older consoles,"" says NPD's Sam Naji. ""The decline in unit spending was also compounded by the 7 percent decline in the ARP for consoles and a 22 percent decline in the ARP for portables.” Videogame software spending, including digital estimates, grew 8% to $273.7M.

 Reacting to news of a possible sale of Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) -- which just closed up 24.7% after spiking 15% on earlier chatter -- Credit Suisse believes SAP is the most likely acquirer. Several vendors are still missing critical CRM components, the firm says, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a potential bidder as well. Acquisitions in the cloud sector have tended to focus on the multiples of enterprise value to the last-12-months subscription revenues, it says. Modeling several acquisitions over the past year and applying that multiple to Marketo ($198.9M in last-12-months sub revenue, and revenue growth of 38.1%) brings a share price of $44.35 -- 65.7% upside from the just-inflated closing price.

UBS recently hosted a call with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) expert Mary Jo Foley, who has covered the company for 2+ decades. Highlights:
Q: How far along is the company in its transition to the cloud? A: Microsoft continues to show progress across multiple product fronts as the company manages its way through the cloud transition. The company is well on its way to management's stated goal of a $20B commercial cloud run rate by FY18, having  recently reached a $9.4B run rate at +71% y/y growth. We think the company gets there much quicker, but caution that MSFT's expansive customer base could present additional challenges. Evidence: FQ2 commercial cloud revenue accelerated to a >$9.4B run rate (up more than 70% y/y, w/ >350 of the Fortune 500 now using 2+ MSFT cloud offerings). This puts the business well above pace towards reaching mgmt's stated objective of a $20Bn run rate in FY18 (which assumes a ~35% CAGR). We note that this growth has been entirely organic (w/ no major acquisitions boosting numbers), and that at the current pace (~70% y/y growth), the company would reach this target ~1 year ahead of schedule.
Q: How much upside remains given share price appreciation over the past 12 months? A: MSFT shares have traded up ~30% over the past 12 months (vs. NASDAQ down 3%), but we still think there is room left in the tank, as the company is demonstrating product strength in several new categories (CRM + ERP, O365, security, IaaS/PaaS, BI/analytics), which we believe present MSFT with $185B+ of additional market opportunity.
UBS: MSFT is executing a balanced top- and bottom-line story, featuring CEO Nadella ""innovating"" and CFO Hood ""disciplined spender."" With a strong initial push, we see real benefits starting to show through in the numbers, including: 1) Unearned revenue building (flat in F15, but est. +11% in F16); 2) cost cutting measures taking hold, with opex flat (F14 to F16) and margins inflecting (~30% OM in F15, which we think can get back to the mid-30s); and cash flow trending in the right direction (1H16 FCF +9% y/y). The new era of MSFT is resonating with investors and we expect shares to continue to benefit from the move to higher-quality platforms and the company's aggressive push to the cloud.

""Ultimately, we believe MSFT will be successful in driving the only true unified hybrid cloud platform,"" writes Oppenheimer's Tim Horan, assuming coverage on Microsoft (MSFT +0.7%) an Outperform rating and $62 target.
Horan: ""Instead of fighting the inevitable shift to the cloud, MSFT is fully embracing it, enabling enterprise adoption of a fully integrated hybrid stack (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) and using the power of the cloud to introduce an overall better operating system (for both developers/ customers) which works across all Windows devices ... While execution is the biggest risk, a seamless, integrated cloud offering, combined with a unified development platform across devices is the right strategy for the future.""
Jim Cramer said he concurred with Oppenheimer, and that he considered it misguided to view Microsoft as a PC play. He added a declining dollar - the dollar is now at $1.13 against the euro - will give a lift to tech giants in general.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is just ~$2 removed from a 52-week high of $56.85 (set in December) after beating FQ2 estimates with the help of job cuts, buybacks, Azure/Office 365 growth, and a smaller sales decline for the More Personal Computing (Windows, hardware, Bing) segment.

IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

Notably, Talko was founded by Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's former CTO and chief software architect, and someone once referred to by Bill Gates as one of the best programmers on the planet. Ozzie won't be rejoining Microsoft, but the rest of Talko's team will be coming on board.
Talko's technology will be integrated with both Skype and the Skype for Business (formerly Lync) unified communications platform. In addition to saving voice conversations, its apps let users tag and bookmark specific moments during a talk, and use a phone's camera to share related photos or live video. Saved content gets stored in the cloud, and cached on devices.
Microsoft has made a string of productivity app purchases in recent years, as it tries to keep Google and upstarts such as Slack (SLACK) at bay. Past deals include Yammer (enterprise social networking), Sunrise (calendars), Acompli (e-mail), and Wunderlist (to-do lists).

 Walt Disney (DIS -0.8%) launched Disney Infinity 3.0 for the Apple TV today, and unlike many games for the box, it comes with a chunky controller usually seen with higher-end gaming consoles. That could prove a critical test of whether the platform could support more intense gaming, and present real competition to the top two consoles made by Sony (NYSE:SNE) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Most all games on Apple TV are controlled by the device's slender remote. But the Nimbus controller made by SteelSeries (specifically for Apple's device) features analog sticks and D-pads familiar to console gamers, and sells for $50 (but at a $15 discount in the Infinity 3.0 bundle). Disney's entry in the toys-to-life category has underperformed compared to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders -- also now on Apple TV -- but the combination of content brands that Disney can leverage for the free-form game, including Marvel and Star Wars, has kept hopes high for the platform.

After several quarters of providing light guidance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is singing a different tune today: The software giant has guided on its call for its three reporting segments to collectively post FQ2 revenue of $24.8B-$25.4B, in-line with a $25.1B consensus and likely sparking hopes of upside given Microsoft's history of guiding conservatively.
Productivity & Business Processes is expected to see revenue of $6.6B-$6.7B, Intelligent Cloud $6.2B-$6.3B, and More Personal Computing $12B-$12.4B. Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on revenue growth, after having a 5% impact in FQ1.
Though revenue fell 7% Y/Y in FQ1 due to PC weakness and cloud transition (pushes out revenue recognition), cloud subscription billings helped the unearned revenue balance (non-GAAP) rise 3% Y/Y (9% exc. forex) to $23.1B. The contracted but not billed balance was above $23.5B.
Also: Bing, once a large cash sinkhole, is finally profitable. Search-related revenue topped $1B in FQ1, with search ad revenue (ex-TAC) rising 23% Y/Y. Windows 10/Cortana integration appears to be helping: Nearly 20% of the quarter's search revenue came from Windows 10 devices.
Other details: 1) Office commercial product/services revenue fell 2% Y/Y thanks to the 365 transition. Office consumer revenue fell 13%. 2) Xbox Live monthly active users rose 28% to 39M. 3) Enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers more than doubled Y/Y to over 20K. 4) Windows volume license revenue fell 3% Y/Y, and Surface revenue fell 26% to $672M ahead of the Surface Pro 4 launch.

Segment op. income rose 14% to $2.4B. Azure revenue more than doubled Y/Y.
Productivity & Business Processes (Office/Office 365 and Dynamics apps) revenue fell 3% Y/Y (+4% exc. forex), with sales pressured by the shift from up-front licenses to cloud subscriptions. Op. income fell 7% Y/Y to $3.1B. Office 365 consumer subs grew by ~3M Q/Q to 18.2M; Dynamics revenue grew 12% in constant currency.
More Personal Computing (Windows, search, games, hardware) revenue fell 17% Y/Y (13% exc. forex) to $9.4B due to PC weakness and declining phone sales (-54% in constant currency). Op. income fell 4% to $1.6B. With the Windows 10 launch providing a boost, Windows OEM revenue fell 6% Y/Y, an improvement from FQ4's 22%.

Financials: Lifting EPS: GAAP operating expenses fell 7% Y/Y to $7.3B (job cuts at work) after backing out year-ago one-time charges. Also helping: $4B was spent on buybacks.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will provide Yahoo (YHOO) with Web and image search services, as well as search ads via its AdSense for Search (AFS) platform (allows a custom Google-powered search engine to be provided). The deal covers both PCs and mobile devices, and will apply to Yahoo proprieties and affiliate sites in the U.S., Canada, and various Asian, African, and Latin American markets (but apparently not Europe, where regulators have been closely probing Google). (8-K filing)
Google will ""pay Yahoo a percentage of the gross revenues from AFS ads displayed on Yahoo Properties or Affiliate Sites,"" with the exact figure varying based on geography and platform. Yahoo will pay fees for Web and image search results. Yahoo ""has discretion to select which search queries to send to Google and is not obligated to send any minimum number of search queries.""
The deal, which could raise some eyebrows among regulators given Google's search dominance, follows an April restructuring of Yahoo's search pact with Microsoft/Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT) that made the alliance non-exclusive on both PCs and mobile. The revised deal still requires 51% of Yahoo's PC search traffic to carry Bing results and ads.

comScore estimates Yahoo had a 12.7% September PC search share in the U.S. (still by far the world's biggest ad market). Google's share is pegged at 63.8%, and Microsoft's at 20.6%. StatCounter estimates Yahoo's U.S. mobile/tablet search share is at 6.8%, and Google's at 88.4%.
YHOO -0.6% after hours after disclosing the deal in tandem with a Q3 miss. GOOG is flat. There was already speculation a deal could happen, given Yahoo has been testing Google-powered results.

Much like Google/Motorola's settlement with Apple last year, the Microsoft deal comes with an agreement to cooperate on various patent issues.

JPMorgan has downplayed those concerns, arguing most ad-blocking takes place on desktops, that far more time is spent on mobile apps (largely immune to ad-blocking for now) than browsers, that publishers are starting to withhold content from those using ad-blockers, and that ad spend is shifting towards formats more immune to ad-blocking (e.g. native ads).

The latest major update to Microsoft's (MSFT +0.9%) Office cash cow will officially roll out on Windows in 12 days. An IT pro/developer preview has been available since March, and a public preview since May.

Office 2016 brings with it real-time co-editing/collaboration features previously available through the Office Online apps, and which have long been a strong point for Google Apps. It also delivers easier cloud document syncing, new IT admin and security tools such as Data Loss Prevention and multi-factor authentication, better Outlook performance, and an improved software update model for businesses.
Separately, Microsoft is updating its Office iPad apps, in part to better support the 12.9""/enterprise-focused iPad Pro (announced yesterday). iOS 9's Split View and Slide Over multitasking features (available on the Pro and certain other iPads) will be supported, as will annotation via the Apple Pencil stylus. Microsoft exec Kirk Konigsbauer made a surprise appearance yesterday at Apple's product launch event.
With the Office 365 transition (pushes out revenue recognition relative to up-front license sales) and soft PC sales weighing, Microsoft's Office Commercial revenue fell 4% Y/Y in calendar Q2. Traditional Office consumer license revenue fell 42%, while consumer Office 365 subs rose by nearly 3M Q/Q to 15.2M.

Also disclosed: Over 122 years of gameplay have been streamed from the Xbox One to Win. 10 systems, and the Windows Store has seen 6x as many downloads per Win. 10 device as it has for Win. 8 devices. The latter likely has a lot to do with the store's integration with the search bar found next to Win. 10's Start menu, and the ability to run Metro-style apps downloaded from the store on the traditional desktop UI.
Microsoft has generally seen positive reviews for Win. 10. However, with the OS provided as a free upgrade to Win. 7/8 users, expectations for its impact on PC sales have been subdued. IDC forecast today global PC shipments will drop 8.7% in 2015 to 281.6M - an 11.8% drop was estimated for Q2 - and decline further in 2016 before stabilizing in 2017.

Forex is expected to have a 5% impact on FQ1 and FQ2 sales growth.

Ahead of the job cuts and the related narrowing of Microsoft's phone efforts, phone revenue fell 38% Y/Y to $1.23B (feature phone decline), with a negative gross margin. Lumia units rose 10% to 8.4M, but Lumia revenue fell due to a lower ASP.

""If anything, the thing that I'm signaling most to the investors, to the employees is let's stop this thing about trying to atomically dissect any one [product line].""
Nadella talks up Microsoft's Continuum software - it changes the UI of a Windows device based on whether a user is relying on a keyboard/mouse, fingers, or stylus - as a differentiator. But he adds Microsoft's goal is now to ""be present on every mobile endpoint,"" regardless of platform. ""It's not (just) the notion of having our application endpoints ... on every one of the two billion devices. We want to have Microsoft experiences, because to me that's a platform play.""
The HoloLens augmented reality headset is declared to be part of both Microsoft's mobile and enterprise strategies. ""When the person was using Autodesk and Maya on the desktop and just moved to a 3D model and interacted, they weren't using their phone.""

""With the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we are watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season, and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory build-up,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su during last Thursday's earnings CC (transcript).
To date, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has only said Windows 10 (currently in the technical preview stage) will launch at some point this summer. AMD is among the Microsoft partners likely to be given advance notice about the software giant's launch plans.
A late-July launch would make the OS available in time for the back-to-school season, and would be well-received by a PC industry that just had a very rough Q1 caused in large part by soft enterprise and desktop demand. Windows 10 contains a bevy of enterprise-friendly features meant to win over businesses that shunned Windows 8. It will also be available as a free upgrade for users of both legitimate and pirated Windows copies, though the latter will still be viewed as unlicensed.
Separately, Microsoft has launched Azure Service Fabric, a framework that helps developers scale and customize Azure-based services more easily. The solution relies on breaking complex apps into ""microservices"" that can be jointly managed and automated, and programmed via Visual Studio. It follows the March launch of Azure App Service, a cross-platform Web/mobile app development service.
Microsoft is up strongly amid a 1.2% gain for the Nasdaq. Earnings arrive on Thursday.

 Kurt DelBene, who stepped down as Microsoft's (MSFT +0.2%) Office division chief in 2013 as part of Steve Ballmer's big reorg, has returned to the company to be its EVP of corporate strategy and planning. He'll report to Satya Nadella.
During his time away from Microsoft, DelBene oversaw efforts to fix Healthcare.gov. In his new job, he'll ""lead both cross-engineering and cross-business strategy and execution initiatives with an emphasis on opportunities that span product and engineering boundaries.""
Microsoft has seen plenty of C-Suite changes since Nadella became CEO 14 months ago.

""There are natural synergies we see with a combination, both strategic and financial, and we see an easy fit within LinkedIn’s (LNKD) business model,"" writes Topeka's Victor Anthony, praising the Lynda.com acquisition. He admits the purchase is expensive - with Lynda having posted 2014 revenue of ~$150M, LinkedIn is paying 10x trailing sales - but (like others) also sees ""a compelling opportunity"" for cross-selling.
Macquarie's Tom White observes LinkedIn could offer premium subscriptions that bundle Lynda's courses, and that it can use its data to pitch users on Lynda services. Cantor's Youssef Squali calls the purchase ""another significant step toward building the world’s first economic graph.""
Re/code's Kurt Wagner notes Lynda could help LinkedIn make further inroads with students, and that the companies' missions align. ""LinkedIn aims to connect people with job opportunities. Lynda.com aims to connect people with an education about those jobs.""

Discussing the deal with Wired, CEO Jeff Weiner argues there's an opportunity to translate Lynda's material into Chinese and other languages. He also suggests the content could boost LinkedIn's user engagement (a historical issue for the company), and that LinkedIn could use its publishing platform to identify potential Lynda contributors.

The 3G-only Lumia 430 is Microsoft's (MSFT +1.4%) cheapest Windows Phone to date. It has a 4"" 800x480 display and 8GB of storage, runs on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) low-end Snapdragon 200 processor (dual-core, 1.2GHz.), and contains a 2MP rear camera to go with a VGA front camera.
The 430, which goes on sale in April, also supports dual SIMs (important for emerging markets) and comes with up to 30GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its unveiling arrives three weeks after Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 640 and 640XL, and four months after it launched the low-end Lumia 535 (5"" display and 3G-only, starts at €110).
Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4. While costlier Lumias have struggled to gain ground against the iPhone and high-end Android hardware (thanks in part to iOS/Android's app support edge), cheaper models have fared well in many cost-sensitive emerging markets. The 430 aims to significantly lower the cost edge the cheapest Android devices still have.

Windows 10 (MSFT +0.1%) ""will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages,"" OS chief Terry Myerson writes in a blog post. COO Kevin Turner previously said Windows 10 would be available in in late summer or early fall.
Meanwhile, during a talk with Reuters, Myerson stated Microsoft will be ""upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine, to Windows 10."" He asserts Microsoft's goal with the initiative is to ""re-engage"" with Chinese Windows users, a huge percentage of whom have pirated copies.
To further its Chinese Windows reach, Microsoft has struck distribution deals with Lenovo, Tencent, and Qihoo; Lenovo will offer Windows 10 ""upgrade services"" at 2,500 service centers and retail stores, while Tencent and Qihoo will provide the OS to the hundreds of millions of users of their Web services.

In January, Microsoft promised Windows 10, which contains many features meant to win over enterprises that shunned Windows 8, would be a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8.1 users. The company has suggested it will rely more on services to monetize Windows (already free or discounted for smaller/cheaper hardware) going forward.
Microsoft is coming off a December quarter in which its Windows OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue both fell 13% Y/Y, thanks largely to discounts and slowing business PC sales. Intel's Q1 warning (blamed on business weakness and lower-than-expected customer inventories) suggests PC demand has remained soft thus far in 2015.
Also: Myerson says Microsoft is launching a free version of Windows 10 for small-footprint embedded/IoT devices. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is among the early supporters, launching a development kit that features its mid-range Snapdragon 410 processor.

As part of a broader Internet/cloud software stock coverage launch, Brean's Sarah Hindlian (formerly with Evercore and JPMorgan) has started LinkedIn (LNKD) with a Sell rating and $208 target.
Hindlian thinks expectations for LinkedIn's Sales Navigator social selling platform (now a large % of subscription revenue) are too high, and that the ""browsability"" of its core site is lacking. ""While we note that LinkedIn has a valuable asset — its database of global professionals and their respective networks - we fear attempts to monetize it could be more limited than investors may realize.""
She argues LinkedIn's aggressive efforts to boost engagement via its messaging platform (InMails), publishing platform, and other services are hurting the user experience, while failing to boost time spent on its site. ""In the long term we are concerned that investors are comfortable comparing a sales user base to a talent recruitment base, noting that any successful loading of sales people onto LinkedIn is likely to significantly disrupt users, and therefore disrupt Ad Revenues.""

Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) has ""generated $1 billion in total worldwide revenue from Azure since 2011,"" BI's Julie Bort reports after talking with sources. Bloomberg reported in 2013 Microsoft had produced $1B in Azure-related revenue; however, that figure also included software purchases tied to deployments of the cloud infrastructure/app development (IaaS/PaaS) platform.
Bort adds over 3K companies have added Azure to their existing enterprise contracts, and that many of them ""are not using Azure at all, or have dabbled with it and then ignored it."" Salespeople have reportedly been pressured to boost Azure sales, and have ""sold Azure by discounting other software and adding the money saved on that software back into the contract as credits to try Azure.""
Microsoft hasn't broken out Azure revenue by itself; it's only reported as part of a Commercial Cloud segment that also includes commercial Office 365 and cloud Dynamics app sales.
BI's figure suggests Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has a sizable revenue lead over Azure. Amazon's ""Other"" revenue, which is dominated by AWS, totaled $5.6B in 2014 (+42% Y/Y). Synergy Research estimates Amazon had a 30% Q4 IaaS/PaaS revenue share on the back of 51% Y/Y growth, and Microsoft a 10% share (#2 overall) with 96% growth.

A local Microsoft exec is quoted as saying the plants will be shuttered by the end of March, with production capacity transferred to Vietnam.
Microsoft announced last July it's cutting 12.5K phone division jobs, and 18K within the company overall. The software giant is in the midst of significantly paring back the division's declining feature phone ops; it sold 39.7M non-Lumia phones in the December quarter to go with 10.5M Lumias.
The job cuts come as Microsoft continues dealing with a Chinese antitrust probe, and a far-reaching effort by China to lower its dependence on foreign tech suppliers. The company laid off its Chinese Xbox R&D team last fall.

Though more complex to run that standard public cloud solutions, hybrid clouds are ""likely to grow as a percentage of total cloud deployments in the next two to three years"" due to strong corporate interest, argues Pac Crest's Brendan Barnicle. He expects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has made an aggressive hybrid cloud push via Azure and its integrations with various on-premise Microsoft products, to benefit.
While Amazon and Google overwhelmingly focus on public cloud services, Barnicle observes many enterprises are more partial to a hybrid approach in which mission-critical apps and data are kept on-premise, while other workloads are moved to public clouds. He also points out hybrid clouds enable new backup, disaster recovery, and archiving services, among others.
In addition, Barnicle argues a server upgrade cycle resulting from Microsoft's ending of Windows Server 2003 support (set for July 14) will boost Azure demand. ""We believe many of these customers will be upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2, which would allow hybrid cloud deployments. Additionally, most of the SMB customers that need to upgrade are likely to transition to a public cloud solution such as Azure.""
Rackspace, IBM, and other backers of the OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform are also betting heavily on hybrid clouds. Meanwhile, Google struck a deal last month with VMware to make several Google public cloud services available on VMware's vCloud Air hybrid cloud platform.

 Six months after filing a contract dispute suit with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) over unpaid Android royalties, Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%) says it has settled the dispute. Terms are confidential.
Microsoft previously suggested Samsung stopped paying royalties in late 2013, with the electronics giant arguing the Nokia deal (by making Microsoft a phone manufacturer itself) nullifies the 2011 Microsoft/Samsung deal and requires a new cross-licensing agreement to be inked.

Co-founder/CEO Aaron Levie, best known to some for his Twitter one-liners, made the rounds today, arguing more than once his company's offerings are well-differentiated from the aggressively-priced cloud storage/file-sharing services of tech giants.
Levie during a talk with Barron's: ""What we’ve built really is software to help manage and collaborate and share throughout the business ... ultimately our customers buy our solution because we have built an amazing product to manage all that content. We get compared to more storage-oriented products, but there’s more to it.""
He called Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose SharePoint collaboration platform is widely deployed and which is now offering unlimited OneDrive storage to Office 365 subs, Box's biggest competitor, but also one Box can stand out relative to. ""I think our real differentiation is we do all the enterprise-oriented delivery, the industry compliance for FINRA, the security, and all that — but the really unique part is we deliver that in a consumer-grade experience, with open APIs, and that works across platforms.""
Levie suggests to Forbes Box will focus going forward on giving clients more tools for using/interpreting data, pointing to its recent acquisition of medical image-sharing platform MedXT as an example.

""We are clearly growing faster than Salesforce (CRM +4%) and were more than three times the size of Workday (WDAY +3.2%)."" Both firms are posting solid gains.

The WSJ reports Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has reached a deal to buy Israeli cybersecurity/identity-protection software firm Aorato for ~$200M, and plans to announce it today. The paper reported in July a deal was close.
Aorato's products complement Microsoft's Active Directory enterprise authentication/ID-management software service, since they analyze Active Directory interactions to create user profiles and detect suspicious activity. There could also be synergies with the cloud-based Azure Active Directory service.
In its latest effort to grow its developer base (previous) and support rival platforms, Microsoft is open-sourcing the server stack for its.NET software framework (underpins many Windows apps), and allowing developers to write server/cloud-based .NET apps for Linux and Mac OS. The move could help .NET better compete against alternatives such as Ruby on Rails and PHP.
Microsoft has also: 1) Launched a free version of its mainstay Visual Studio 2013 app development suite for non-enterprise users. 2) Previewed Visual Studio 2015, which the company says is ""built from the ground up with support for iOS, Android and Windows.""
Microsoft says it will ""shortly"" reach 10M Xbox One sales, and that sales have tripled since a $50 price cut went into effect on Nov. 2. The latest figures still leaves the One's total sales behind the 13.5M seen by the PS4 as of the end of Q3.
The pickup in Xbox One sales is a positive for CPU/GPU supplier AMD, which was estimated by IHS last year to receive $110 per unit.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its FQ1 CC for FQ2 revenue of $25.4B-$26.5B, below a $27.9B consensus. But the company has shown quite the knack for guiding conservatively in recent quarters; FQ1 revenue ($23.2B) was soundly above the guidance provided in July ($21.2B-$22.3B).
The company notes Devices & Consumer Licensing revenue (-9% Y/Y in FQ1) is being affected by the loss of revenue from Nokia; Nokia revenue totaled $650M in FQ2 last year.
Total Windows OEM revenue fell 2% Y/Y in FQ1, as price cuts offset unit growth. ""Windows Phone revenue"" (driven by Android royalties) fell 46%, something attributed in part to a ""higher mix of low-royalty devices;"" Microsoft is in the midst of a royalty dispute with high-end Android leader Samsung.
9.3M Lumia phones were sold (up slightly Y/Y), aided by strong European and low-end demand. With feature phone sales falling quickly, phone hardware revenue is expected to drop to $2B-$2.2B in FQ2 from FQ1's better-than-expected $2.6B.
Search ad revenue rose 23% Y/Y; Microsoft pegs Bing's U.S. search share at 19.4% (+140 bps Y/Y).

Rackspace and VMware would probably beg to differ; Amazon and Google, maybe not so much.
The CNBC talk was followed by a webcast in which Nadella unveiled the Cloud Platform System, an on-premise appliance (to be sold by Dell) that enables Azure private cloud and (by linking with Microsoft's public cloud) hybrid cloud services. Microsoft has long argued Azure's strong hybrid cloud support (aided by the company's on-premise software) acts as a differentiator relative to Amazon/Google).

Also unveiled: 1) An Azure Marketplace that allows clients to quickly add apps and services from third parties; Amazon has something similar. 2) New high-performance Azure virtual machine and storage options. 3) Azure support for CoreOS, a Linux variant that's popular among companies deploying app containers (a lightweight alternative to virtualization software from the likes of Microsoft and VMware).
Driving home his multi-platform push, Nadella made the CoreOS announcement in front of a sign that (amusingly enough) read ""Microsoft [hearts] Linux.""

In a new employee memo, Satya Nadella says Microsoft is now moving to eliminate the first 13K positions, and will still continue to add jobs in some areas. ""We will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster ... we plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways.""
He suggests Microsoft will streamline the Nokia phone lineup, and will ""focus on breakthrough innovation"" on the high-end. Certain low-end Nokia X (Android) devices will be migrated to Windows Phone.
The move comes after last week's memo shied away from Steve Ballmer's ""Devices & Services"" mantra, and suggested big changes in product strategy and engineering processes were afoot.

Microsoft (MSFT +3.4%) has surged to new post-Dot.com bubble highs following Intel's Q2 results and multiple reports pointing to big layoffs in the wake of Satya Nadella's memo.
In addition to beating Q2 estimates, Intel provided strong Q3 and full-year guidance, and respectively reported 6% and 19% Y/Y sales increases for its PC and server CPU reporting segments. On its CC, Intel noted it's seeing ""clear signs"" of a business PC refresh cycle, while adding consumer/emerging markets PC demand remains soft.
Intel's cloud, HPC, and enterprise server-related sales each rose over 15% Y/Y. The upcoming launch of Intel's Grantley Xeon CPUs is expected to provide a boost to server demand, as is Microsoft's plan to end Windows Server 2003 support by July 2015. A shift in spend towards Internet companies using cheap white-label hardware (often running on Linux) remains a headwind.

""We viewed [Satya Nadella's] letter yesterday to employees as putting everyone on notice that he wants to make organizational changes,"" writes Nomura's Rick Sherlund after taking in Nadella's missive.
Sherlund thinks Microsoft (MSFT +1%) might shed 5%-10% of the ~125K employees working for either Microsoft proper or Nokia's phone unit. He estimates cutting a quarter of the 25K-strong Nokia workforce would ""eliminate about $1.0b of cost structure.""
Meanwhile, others have honed in on Nadella's productivity emphasis, and his attempts to distance himself from Steve Ballmer's ""devices & services"" mantra. Harry McCracken: ""The new vision ... feels less like it’s reacting to the changes to the industry which Apple has wrought by imitating them: Apple is never, ever going to have a mission statement which leads with the word 'productivity.'""

CITEworld, for its part, likes Nadella's remarks about making heavy use of data to drive product decision-making.
In an interview with The Verge, Nadella rejects traditional distinctions between enterprise and consumer markets. ""Any thinking consumer should consider Microsoft because guess what, you're not just a consumer. You're also going to go to work, you're also going to be productive and we can do a better job for you in there""

At the same time, Nadella affirms Microsoft's commitment to the Xbox, and argues technologies developed by the Xbox unit have strengthened Windows, Skype, and other products.
Microsoft has already shown a greater willingness to support rival platforms since Nadella became CEO in February, and has also shaken up its executive ranks. A massive reorg meant to strengthen cross-product collaboration was launched a year ago.

The service aims to enable Web-connected embedded platforms in verticals such as retail, health, manufacturing, and transportation.
IT outsourcing firms Cognizant and Infosys are among Microsoft's service partners. Intel and ARM are already going after this market by via solutions that combine their CPU designs with related software.
Microsoft is also unveiling its Analytics Platform System, a hardware appliance (to be sold by OEMs) that allows data handled by SQL Server's data warehousing solution (used to process/analyze structured data) and the Hadoop big data framework (used for giant unstructured datasets) to be integrated and jointly queried.

Satya Nadella calls the solution ""big data in a box."" Teradata (NYSE:TDC) and Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) are among the companies in Microsoft's crosshairs.

SQL Server 2014 has also been launched. As promised, the latest update to Microsoft's database platform (produces $5B+/year in sales) features in-memory capabilities that arguably make it a meaningful rival to SAP's popular Hana in-memory database.
While going over the products, Nadella declares Microsoft needs to create a ""data culture"" to thrive, in part by using its own products. ""Think of Office as the canvas, or the surface area, or the scaffolding from which you can access the data.""

Phil Spencer, until now the head of Microsoft's (MSFT +2.4%) game studios, is now in charge of the entire Xbox unit (hardware, games, Xbox Live). He takes command of a business that has seen several high-profile departures over the last year (inc. division chief Don Mattrick and product chief Marc Whitten).
Interestingly, Spencer will report to OS chief Terry Myerson rather than Stephen Elop, who will be in charge of Microsoft's other hardware ops once the Nokia deal closes (taking over from Julie-Larson Green). His gaming background is particularly noteworthy in light of how the PS4's strong gaming focus (along with its lower price) is seen as contributing to its sales lead over the Xbox One.
Also: Microsoft has made former Azure development chief Scott Guthrie the permanent head of its enterprise/cloud ops (includes products previously within the Server & Tools unit), and promoted him to the status of EVP. Guthrie has been enterprise/cloud's acting chief since Satya Nadella was named CEO.

Also of note: 1) Microsoft has made the full versions of its iOS/Android Office smartphone apps completely free for home use, and is promising Android tablet apps are on the way. 2) Though doing so requires giving Apple a 30% cut, Microsoft is allowing free iPad users to upgrade to Office 365 from their devices.

 Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) sale of its handset business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be completed in April rather than at the end of this month, as initially expected. The postponement is due to the deal not yet receiving authorization from a number of regulators, including in China. The transaction has already received approval in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, Nokia is facing another tax claim in India, this time from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, which says it is owed €300M ($417M) on unpaid taxes on sales of phones made at the company's factory in Chennai.

The iPad accounted for roughly a third of Q4 tablet shipments, but (from all indications) its enterprise share is much higher. ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley observes the iPad Office apps appear set to arrive before Microsoft's touch-friendly Gemini Office Windows apps (expected later this year).
Separately, Xbox chief product officer and long-time Xbox Live chief Marc Whitten has announced he's leaving to become the product chief of home audio system maker Sonos.

Not surprisingly, the apps will require an Office 365 subscription, much like the Office iPhone and Android apps released last year. Since the release of those apps, Google has made its Quickoffice productivity suite free, and Apple has made its iWork suite free to buyers of new iDevices.
Office remains Microsoft's biggest money-maker: Before changing up its reporting, the company's Business Division (dominated by Office) had FY13 op. income of $16.2B, well above the $9.5B produced by the Windows unit and the $8.2B produced by Server & Tools.
In a move viewed by some as a prelude to an iPad launch, Microsoft recently rolled out a Personal edition of Office 365 that goes for only $70/year, 30% less than Office Home Premium (supports up to 5 PCs).

Sony (SNE -0.8%) SVP Guy Longworth states the PS4's January U.S. sales were nearly twice that of its leading next-gen console rival, widely assumed to be the Xbox One (MSFT +0.1%).
The remarks come after NPD reported the PS4 outsold the Xbox One in the U.S. in January, and also had an edge in game sales. Of the seven games on NPD's January bestseller list offered for both next-gen consoles, the PS4 version posted stronger retail sales in five instances.
Sony announced last month PS4 sell-through totaled 4.2M as of Dec. 28. Microsoft, by comparison, reported seeing 3M+ 2013 Xbox One sales. The PS4's lower price tag ($399 vs. $499) and stronger gaming focus have helped its cause.

Sources tell The Verge, which has provided plenty of Microsoft (MSFT +1%) scoops over the last two years, the software giant is ""seriously considering allowing Android apps to run on both Windows and Windows Phone.""
Employees are said to be very divided, with some going as far as to support having Android apps in the Windows/WP app stores, and others fearing doing so ""could lead to the death of the Windows platform altogether.""
The report comes a month after Intel (INTC +0.5%) and its OEM partners showed off Android/Windows hybrids at CES, albeit without either Microsoft or Google's backing. It also comes amid reports Nokia is planning to launch a low-end Android phone featuring Microsoft/Nokia services and a Windows Phone-like UI.
Many already expect new CEO Satya Nadella to shake up Microsoft's mobile strategy, with an eye towards increasing support for rival mobile platforms. The Verge doesn't have any details on Nadella's views on the matter.
Android app support would allow Microsoft to tap into a developer ecosystem that easily surpasses the ones for Windows Phone and Metro-style Windows apps. If it happens, Google's Android apps/services almost certainly won't be part of the package.

The halt is tied to Nokia's ongoing $1.1B tax dispute with the Indian government. Nokia has responded by appealing to India's Supreme Court. In the meantime, chairman Risto Siilasmaa is meeting with government figures in an attempt to find a resolution.

Sources tell the WSJ Nokia's unit phone, soon to be in Microsoft's (MSFT +0.4%) hands, will show off its first Android phone this month at the Mobile World Congress (runs from Feb. 24-27).
In-line with past reports, the phone is said to be a low-end device aimed at emerging markets, and thus appears meant to be an alternative to Nokia's Asha feature phones than mid-range or high-end Lumia models.
Recent leaks have indicated the phone will have a Windows Phone-like UI, and come with unmistakably low-end specs (4"" 800x480 display, dual-core 1GHz. QCOM Snapdragon CPU).
Both the WSJ and others have reported the phone won't support the apps/services that come with Google's version of Android (Play, Gmail, Maps, Now, etc.). Instead, Nokia/Microsoft services will be pre-installed, including a Nokia Android app store (its selection is bound to be much smaller than Google Play's).
Nokia's phone unit posted a 29% Y/Y sales drop in Q4, a decline that had much to do with plunging feature phone sales in the face of booming low-end Android phone sales in emerging markets. Though Windows Phone's price points have fallen considerably, they still don't match those of the cheapest Android devices.

The effort is said to involve top Yahoo execs, including three product SVPs, and to feature just a 3-4 month timeframe. Over time, it  could ""result in a full search engine, possibly more oriented to mobile than the desktop.""
Marissa Mayer has voiced displeasure with the performance of the Microsoft deal, under which Yahoo's results and search ad platform are powered by Bing, and has reportedly considered abandoning it before.
However, the deal is set to last until 2020 and currently features revenue/search guarantees (the latest renewal expires in March). Any attempt to create a fully-fledged search alternative to Google and Bing would carry both monetization risks and require massive R&D investments.

Analysts and pundits generally praise Nadella's technical expertise and product development skills, as well as his success at creating profitable/growing enterprise businesses. Microsoft's commercial reporting segments accounted for 65% of its gross profit during the December quarter.
At the same time, some worry Nadella won't make the kind of sweeping changes (major cost cuts, the shedding of unprofitable units) that were expected of Mulally, and have reportedly been considered by Stephen Elop.

By and large, the sell-side is pleased with Microsoft's enterprise strength, hardware sales, and cost controls. Credit Suisse has upped its PT to $42.50 from $40, while predicting Windows profitability and growth will improve in the next two quarters.

The software giant is also lowering its FY14 (ends June '14) opex guidance range to $31.2B-$31.5B from a prior $31.3B-$31.9B, and cutting its FY14 capex budget by $500M to $6B. Microsoft's original capex budget wasn't well-received when first issued.

LinkedIn (LNKD +4.7%) has hired Derek Shen, previously the CEO of Chinese group-buying site Nuomi (now controlled by Baidu), to be the head of its Chinese unit (a newly-created role). Shen will be based out of Beijing.
The hiring is widely being taken as a sign LinkedIn, whose services (unlike Facebook and Twitter's) aren't blocked in China, will soon be launching a Chinese site. The company currently has an office in Hong Kong, but not on the mainland.
Several LinkedIn clones already exist in the Middle Kingdom, but none have taken off the way LinkedIn has in the U.S. and certain international markets. Government agency CNNIC estimates China had 617.6M Internet users at the end of 2013, and 500.1M mobile Internet users. Just 4M of LinkedIn's 259M registered users are currently in China.

 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reportedly considering Ericsson CEO (NASDAQ:ERIC) Hans Vestberg as a replacement for the (shy and) retiring Steve Ballmer. Vestberg joins the likes of former Nokia boss Stephen Elop and Microsoft insider Satya Nadella on the shortlist. Since Vestberg  became CEO of Ericsson in January 2010, revenues have increased from 206B Swedish kronor ($32B) in 2009 to an estimated 225B last year, while the stock price has climbed 19%. Vestberg also oversaw the exit of Ericsson from the mobile-handset market with the break-up of the company's joint venture with Sony. His appointment would therefore possibly raise questions about Microsoft's strategy vis a vis its acquisition of Nokia's mobile-phone unit.  ",0.954,positive,0.8242555555555556

Mobile-Review.com's Eldar Murtazin, who has provided some accurate Windows Phone scoops before, reports Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be making $2.6B in ""support"" payments (likely including marketing spend) to OEM partners in 2014 to compel them to make one Windows Phone apiece.
Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNLF) is said to be receiving $1.2B, Sony (NYSE:SNE) $500M, Huawei $600M, and other firms $300M.
If the report is accurate, it suggests Microsoft's Windows Phone investments could more than negate the considerable Android royalties it stands to receive this year.
It comes just as evidence appears Samsung is prepping a Windows Phone with a 5"" 1080p display. The phone's inclusion of a 3G EV-DO radio (to go with a 4G LTE radio) suggests it could be sold by Verizon and/or Sprint.
Sony recently confirmed it's talking with Microsoft about making a Windows Phone. With Nokia's soon-to-be-acquired phone unit accounting for the lion's share of WP sales, Microsoft has made expanding OEM support a priority.

PC industry names outperformed amid a broader tech rally, aided by a JPMorgan Intel (INTC +4%) note that argued PC demand is stabilizing, and tablet cannibalization diminishing. A number of chip stocks also rallied strongly (SOXX +2.1%).
Also: Major hard drive suspension assembly maker Hutchinson has reported above-consensus Dec. quarter sales, while citing strong demand for 2.5"" notebook drive assemblies. Seagate and Western Digital both rallied.
JPMorgan's Christopher Danely, who upgraded Intel to Overweight, has raised his 2014 estimates soundly above consensus ahead of the chip giant's Thursday Q4 report. Danely notes Intel, Microsoft, H-P, and others have said PC demand is improving, and that Taiwan's big-4 notebook contract manufacturers collectively grew their shipments 7% Q/Q in Q4. Q1 shipments are expected to drop in-line with seasonality.
He also points out tablet shipment growth is decelerating, and forecasts shipments will only rise 25% in 2014 (down from 53% in 2013).
Danely's optimism contrasts with another bearish Intel note from Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon, who estimates five mobile CPU sales are needed to make up for one PC CPU sale, and doubts Intel's foundry business will move the needle.

Teen engagement worries or not, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still the unquestioned colossus of the U.S. social media scene. A Pew survey (.pdf) of 6,010 Americans found 71% claiming to use Facebook, up from 67% in 2012. That compares with 22% for LinkedIn (LNKD - up from 20%), 21% for Pinterest (up from 15%), 18% for Twitter (TWTR - up from 16%), and 17% for Facebook-owned Instagram (up from 13%).
Facebook's success at reeling in older users has helped it continue growing: 45% of respondents age 65 or older said they use Facebook, up from 35% a year ago. 63% of users say they check in daily, and 22% weekly.
Unsurprisingly, Twitter and Instagram's user bases skew young: 31% and 37% of respondents in the age 18-29 demographic respectively use Twitter and Instagram, compared with 9% and 6% in the 50-64 demographic. 46% of Twitter users say they check in daily, a level notably below Facebook's 63% and Instagram's 57%.
A mere 13% of LinkedIn users claim to check in daily, evidence the company's efforts to boost engagement need more work. But the platform is used by 38% of respondents making over $75K, and 27% of all employed respondents. LinkedIn's recruiting and ad clients will be happy to know that.
North America accounted for only 17% of Facebook's Q3 MAUs, but produced 48% of its Q3 revenue. The U.S. accounted for 74% of Twitter's Q3 revenue, and 62% of LinkedIn's.

 The Information reports Sony (SNE -0.1%), which (like many OEMs) has focused its smartphone efforts on building Android hardware, is thinking of launching a Windows Phone (MSFT +0.1%) as soon as mid-2014. The site also reports Microsoft, hungry to expand Windows Phone's OEM support, is ""making new moves"" to win over ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY) and other vendors, such as slashing licensing fees. The Verge reported three weeks ago Microsoft is thinking of offering Windows Phone and RT for free, and monetizing the platforms via ads/services. Microsoft's pending acquisition of Nokia's phone business has fueled concerns third parties will now be reluctant to license WP, particularly since Nokia is the market's dominant player. AdDuplex just estimated Nokia hardware accounts for 92.1% of the WP installed base. But OEM concerns about becoming too dependent on Google could leave Microsoft with an opening. Though IDC estimates WP only had a 3.6% Q3 global smartphone unit share, Kantar Worldpanel believes the OS is faring much better in Europe, assigning it a double-digit share within the EU5. That might be of interest to Sony, whose smartphone ops depend heavily on European and Japanese sales.  ",0.9948,positive,0.8242555555555556

Microsoft (MSFT -1.4%) is down 3% over the last two days, as worries grow (thanks to John Thompson's recent comments) Alan Mulally (F -6.7%) won't be named Steve Ballmer's successor.
Nomura's Rick Sherlund, who not long ago predicted Mulally would be Microsoft's next CEO, now wonders if the Bill Gates quote included in Thompson's remarks indicates ""the board is rethinking the role and looking more exhaustively at candidates from the technology field.""
Moreover, if reports about Ford's board pressing Mulally to give ""a definitive answer"" regarding his future plans are accurate, Sherlund thinks ""he might need to pull his hat out of the ring at some point soon.""
Like others on the Street, he's worried a CEO with an IT background won't be as ""shareholder-friendly"" as Mulally. Sherlund has previously suggested Mulally might cut costs, boost capital returns, and unload Xbox and Bing.
However, FBR's Daniel Ives still thinks Mulally has a shot. He observes today's Ford business update contained no discussion of Mulally's plans, as many expected.

Investors are apparently pleased with a Bloomberg report claiming Alan Mulally and Satya Nadella are now the frontrunners to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's (MSFT +1.7%) next CEO.
If an earlier AllThingsD report is accurate, the choice may not be an either/or one. The site reported Mulally is the top candidate for the job, but (if chosen) would act as a ""caretaker"" CEO paving the way for a lieutenant, and that Nadella as the top choice for the latter role.
Nadella, now in charge of enterprise/cloud product development, ran (before the reorg) a Server & Tools unit that posted 9% sales growth and 13% op. profit growth in FY13.
The business has arguably been Microsoft's biggest success story in recent years, gaining share and obtaining top-5 (if not top-3) positions in markets as disparate as server operating systems (Windows Server), databases (SQL server), virtualization (Hyper-V), systems management (System Center), and cloud app platforms (Azure).

Though Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been seeing intensifying competition in the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, Synergy Research's numbers, like Gartner's, suggest AWS continues to dominate.

Synergy estimates AWS had a 35% IaaS share in Q3, or 5x that of #2 IBM, whose position has been bolstered by SoftLayer. All other vendors are assigned shares below 3%.
The situation is a little different in the cloud app platform (PaaS) market. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Heroku, long a major player, is given a market-leading 18% share. But AWS is close behind at 17%, and so are Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Azure (14%) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) App Engine (13%). All other vendors are estimated to have sub-5% shares.
Altogether, Synergy thinks Amazon grew its IaaS/PaaS revenue by 55% Y/Y, outpacing the 46% growth seen by the overall market. Moreover, AWS' IaaS/PaaS revenue is believed to have eclipsed that of Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce combined.
The report drives home the competitive challenges faced by Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), and other firms striving to take IaaS and/or PaaS share from market leaders.
Synergy thinks the traditional Web hosting market, which Rackspace remains well-exposed to, and which has been pressured by the IaaS market's rise, only grew 3% Y/Y in Q3.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Devices & Studios product chief Julie Larson-Green during a recent UBS conference talk: ""We have the Windows Phone OS. We have Windows RT and we have full Windows. We're not going to have three.""
Though not overtly stating it, Larson-Green hints Windows RT, which has been virtually abandoned by OEM partners, will get the hook. She admits RT lacks the flexibility of traditional Windows (albeit while suggesting it's more mobile-optimized), and that Microsoft didn't do a sufficient job of differentiating its Surface RT and Surface Pro tablets.
Mary-Jo Foley previously reported Microsoft is thinking of merging Windows Phone and RT. She now says (citing a source) ""it's more likely that the Windows Phone OS core is what Microsoft will use as the starting point"" for its merged OS, rather than RT.
Meanwhile, Nomura's Rick Sherlund is making a fresh case for unloading the Xbox unit (previous): He thinks the business will likely lose over $1B this year, and simply isn't enough to ""cement Microsoft’s position in the consumer market,"" given the popularity of mobile media consumption.
A big issue: Mobile's volumes have come to dwarf the console market's. While Sherlund thinks Microsoft might sell 3M-4M Xbox One units in 2013, and Sony is aiming for 5M PS4 sales by the end of March, IDC thinks Q3 smartphone and tablet shipments respectively totaled 261.1M and 47.6M.

But it also states the next-gen Kinect ""isn't a fully realized product yet,"" and that the One's design ""lacks the profile and space-saving considerations of the PlayStation 4 — or even the original Xbox 360.""

The Verge (7.8/10) likes the One's launch titles, and is impressed with the ability of Kinect voice commands to enhance gameplay. At the same time, it criticizes the Kinect's reliability, as well as issues with audio/video quality when passing signals from other devices.

Sena, who is raising his PT to $1,100, sees Google's services investments pressuring near-term margins, but also creating ""a stronger platform ecosystem in which more collected data, better predictive analytics, and an increased amount of screen connectivity will lead to better overall search economics in addition to new opportunities."" 
Needham and Jefferies have raised their PTs to $1,150, and Deutsche has raised its target to $1,220. YouTube's mobile growth, strong paid click volumes, and the potential for Enhanced Campaigns to lift search ad sales (after doing less damage than expected in Q3) are all mentioned as reasons to stay bullish. U.S. Internet peers continue to rally in sympathy: FB +4.1%. LNKD +3.7%. YELP +7.8%. AMZN +3.3%. Z +3.9%. TRLA +4.8%. ZNGA +2.8%. Foreign Internet names are also moving higher: BIDU +5%. YOKU +6.9%.

468,2013-10-17,0.244,More on Microsoft: Major Windows release could arrive in 2015,"

The plugged-in Mary Jo Foley reports Microsoft (MSFT +0.7%) is thinking of releasing its next major Windows update (Win. 8 qualifies as one, 8.1 doesn't) in the spring of 2015, and that the OS will bring Windows and Windows Phone ""closer together.""
Foley adds Microsoft is thinking of merging Windows Phone and the struggling Windows RT (both are ARM-based) by 2015; if a recent report about Windows Phone being updated to support 7""-10"" displays pans out, the integration effort could take the form of phasing out RT in favor of Windows Phone.
Also: Microsoft's new OS division, led by former Windows Phone chief Terry Myerson and created by the reorg, is said to be ""rethinking priorities, workflow and just about everything else"" related to Microsoft's disparate operating systems. Following the reorg, Microsoft overhauled its Windows teams to further tie together PC, mobile, and Xbox development.

469,2013-10-17,0.244,Windows 8.1 receives good (but qualified) reviews; cheaper hardware arrives,"

Windows 8.1 (MSFT +0.6%) is a clear improvement over Windows 8, but doesn't completely address the complaints users have registered over the latter's UI. That seems to be the consensus for reviews of the latest version of Microsoft's PC OS, available starting today as a free upgrade to Win. 8 users.

The Verge (8.8/10) declares every built-in Windows app ""has been improved,"" and is also fond of 8.1's personalization options, snap view features, and universal search support. But it still finds it ""awkward"" to navigate Microsoft's Metro UI with a keyboard and mouse.

Wired: ""Should you upgrade? Yes. It’s a solid update. The people who hated Windows 8, however, likely aren’t going to be much more pleased with 8.1."" PC World: ""Windows 8.1 eases the transition for desktop diehards, granting PC enthusiasts the ability to shun most of the tablet-oriented bits.""
There should be a decent number of reasonably-priced 8.1 tablets/convertibles this holiday season, thanks in part to Microsoft's license discounts for smaller devices. Two examples: Lenovo's $299 Miix and Acer's $330-$380 Iconia W4. Both products have 8"" displays and Intel Bay Trail Atom CPUs.

""We think the stage is set for a series of value creating events to unfold over the next 18 months,"" says analyst Ross MacMIllan, upgrading Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Buy and lifting his price target to $42 from $33.
Among those events is a new operating structure with greater transparency on the best assets, or what MacMillan calls ""BestCo"" - the commercial segment containing key assets transitioning to the cloud. ""OtherCo"" is the devices and consumer segment which carry less clear value. MacMillan sees the market allowing a higher valuation to the BestCo operations.
As for the new CEO, MacMillan sees the potential for better portfolio focus - i.e. which assets should remain as core and what should be viewed as non-core - as well as someone who sees the company's massive recurring cash flows as opportunity to give more back to shareholders.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has rolled out GDR3, a Windows Phone update that adds support for larger (5""+) and higher-resolution (1080p) displays, quad-core CPUs (inc. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800), improved Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity, and support for more home page live tiles.
The update is a big one both because Android has supported larger displays, 1080p, and quad-core for a while, and because it comes ahead of an Oct. 22 Nokia event expected to feature the launch of at least two new Lumia phones, including a 6"" phablet.
Meanwhile, WP ad network AdDuplex's October data indicates the low-end Lumia 520 ($129 off-contract at Wal-Mart) now makes up 32.8% of WP8 devices tracked by its network. The Lumia 920 (high-end) and 620 (mid-range) make up 12.9% apiece, and the Lumia 820 and 720 are each a little below 8%.
Also: Nokia is partnering with Netflix to offer 6-12 months of free streaming to U.K. Lumia buyers, and (per the FT) is planning a big holiday season marketing push with Microsoft and U.K. carriers/retailers to promote Windows Phone. Nokia is reportedly bearing the brunt of the cost for at least one of the Netflix offers.

""We believe back to school PC demand has been virtually absent,"" says Sterne Agee's Vijay Rakesh in a critical note on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Moreover, Sterne thinks high inventories and weak demand are pointing to the absence of a holiday season sales boost (normally 5%-7%) as well.
Rakesh now sees PC sales falling 10.7% Y/Y in Q4, worse than a prior forecast for a 9.6% drop. He also questions the ability of smartphone/tablet CPU sales to offset declining PC CPU sales for Intel, given notebook processors typically sell for several times as much as their mobile counterparts. Oddly enough (given Nokia's limited smartphone share), Rakesh also suggests the Microsoft-Nokia deal is a negative for the chip giant.
In August, IDC lowered its 2013 PC shipment growth forecast to -9.7% from a prior -7.8%. The firm estimates PC shipments fell 11.4% Y/Y in Q2 (Gartner is at 10.9%), and has predicted tablet shipments (aided by seasonality) will exceed PC shipments in Q4.

The report follows one indicating Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working on Office Reader, a ""Windows 8-style"" Office app that supports PDFs, e-bboks, and other document types (could present new competition for ADBE's Acrobat unit), and plans to roll out add real-time collaborative editing support for the Office Web Apps.

Kantar estimates the iPhone had a 39.3% share of U.S. smartphone sales in the June-August timeframe, +540 bps Y/Y. In the EU5, where the iPhone has been losing ground to Android, its share rose 200 bps to 16.1%, and in Japan, it rose to 48.6% prior to the start of NTT DoCoMo's 5S/5C sales.

He also declares Mulally to have ""terrific people skills,"" and a reputation as a ""consensus builder.""

Forbes' Tony Bradley isn't convinced. While calling the 68-year-old Mulally ""a very capable leader,"" he argues Microsoft ""needs a younger, more dynamic CEO with more of an entrepreneurial tech startup mentality.""
Bradley: ""Microsoft is filled with genius at almost every level, but that talent needs to be marshaled and coordinated toward a grand vision that defines the future of technology rather than reacting to it."" Skype's Tony Bates, reportedly also on Microsoft's CEO shortlist, is one of his preferred choices.

 Two sources tell the NYT a Nokia (NOK +0.8%) team ""had Android up and running"" on Lumia phones well before talks to sell Nokia's phone ops to Microsoft (MSFT +1%) began, and that Microsoft was aware of the project. In spite of its alliance with Microsoft, Nokia would've been free to sell Android phones after late 2014. Critics frequently argued the company made a colossal mistake by opting for Windows Phone over Android (currently has a ~75% smartphone share), and Stephen Elop had hinted Nokia was open to using Android down the line. The Microsoft deal prohibits Nokia from offering mobile hardware under its brand until the end of 2015. If the company does have plans to make phones after the deal closes, it isn't tipping its hand. Meanwhile, a Singapore-based startup called Newkia has already recruited a team of former Nokia execs, and promises to poach additional Nokia phone division employees in an effort to build Android hardware true to the spirit of Nokia's design/engineering philosophy. Aided by fresh upgrades and optimism about a phone-free future, Nokia shares had another strong week. They're now up 64% since the Microsoft deal was announced.  ",0.9722,positive,0.8242555555555556

Tablets are the main transgressor, IDC noted. And China and other developing economies, which were once healthy drivers of PC sales, have seen demand dry up at even faster rates than developed markets.
Cannibalization appears to favor the small, as IDC nudged its 2013 tablet forecast to 227.4M, from 229.3M previously. To blame? New smartphones with large screens and the release of wearable devices like smart watches.

Ballmer and Thompson both assert Microsoft will stay committed to its consumer ops, even though enterprise sales are now responsible for the vast majority of its profits, and that the ""consumerization of IT"" makes the two areas increasingly joined at the hip.

Long-time Microsoft follower Mary Jo Foley provides a list of potential replacements. It includes Redmond execs such as COO Kevin Turner and ex-Skype CEO Tony Bates, as well as ex-employees such as Steven Sinofsky, (Nokia CEO) Stephen Elop, and (ex-Juniper CEO) Kevin Johnson.

Two big questions: 1) Did Ballmer lose Gates' support?

The Lumia 520's popularity has much to do with those figures. The low-end phone (Wal-Mart sells a variant for $130 unsubsidized) accounted for 18% of all tracked WP devices, and 27% of WP8 devices, easily the most of any model.

""At this rate, Nokia will be the only Windows Phone OEM by the holidays,"" says TechCrunch's Alex Wilhelm after surveying the data.

The device is said to have a 10.1"" 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 CPU, 32GB of storage, and a detachable keyboard/stand. A Sep. launch is ""rumored.""
""Don't do it, Nokia,"" BGR's Brad Reed advises. Windows RT hardware sales have been ugly, and one major OEM after another has turned its back on the ARM-powered OS, which can't run apps created for Intel/AMD-powered systems. Moreover, companies not named Apple have generally had a rough time selling ~$500 tablets.

App updates, new tile sizes, more personalization options, a boot-to-desktop option, and better keyboard/mouse navigation and settings controls are also part of the package.
A recently-leaked RTM test build indicates Microsoft recently made a few more tweaks to address Win. 8-related complaints. Context menu controls have been changed to make features easier to find, and swiping tips have been built into apps.
