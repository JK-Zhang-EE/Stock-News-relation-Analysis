Here's a smattering of what the analysts are saying today about the Palo Alto automaker. Baird (Buy): ""TSLA reported a Model 3 gross margin of 20%, which significantly exceeded our expectations.

Goldman Sachs (Sell): 'We question if this is not as good as it gets from a near-term upside surprise for shares. The company has maintained that it designed and built the Model 3 with a target 25% gross margin and almost achieved that this quarter (albeit with a rich mix). However, with its own exposure to China tariffs on imported components and likely headwinds to mix as lower price point vehicles are offered, automotive gross margins likely compress sequentially into 4Q18 ��� and could see further mix pressure into 2019 as the US Federal Tax Credit begins to phase out for its vehicles."" JPMorgan (Sell, price target lifted to $225): ""We remain Underweight, both on valuation and concern the new stronger trajectory to earnings and cash may prove less sustainable than the market is likely to presume, including given several headwinds.""Jefferies: ""Assuming R&D spending is not delayed and Tesla is not forced to introduce a lower price (Model 3) prematurely to maintain volume, Tesla could be self-funded.

Still, the double-digit rally is very unlikely to knock bears off their talking points and rather importantly still leaves shares below the conversion price of convertible bonds set to come due.Previously: Tesla rallies with Citron a long (Oct. 23)Previously: Details on Citron's Tesla turnaround (Oct. 23)  ",0.9808,positive,0.7437611620795107

Citron also observes that there is no Tesla killer out there that it can clearly see. Finally, there's that bit about Tesla moving up their earnings day to October 24 (tomorrow).

""About the only person on the board who���s enough of a ruthless bastard to rein Elon Musk in ��� or fire him, if it comes to that ��� is James Murdoch. Musk knows that, too. If Musk truly wants to outwit Murdoch, he���d better abandon the Gracias plan and pick a new independent board member to serve as chair instead.

This was a 20% premium over the ~$350 then current share price (which already reflected a ~16% increase in the price since just prior to announcing Q2 earnings on August 1st). My proposal was based on using a structure where any existing shareholder who wished to remain as a shareholder in a private Tesla could do so, with the $420 per share buyout used only for shareholders that preferred that option.""""After an initial meeting of the board���s outside directors to discuss my proposal (I did not participate, nor did Kimbal), a full board meeting was held. During that meeting, I told the board about the funding discussions that had taken place (more on that below) and I explained why this could be in Tesla���s long-term interest.""""At the end of that meeting, it was agreed that as a next step, I would reach out to some of Tesla���s largest shareholders. Our largest investors have been extremely supportive of Tesla over the years, and understanding whether they had the ability and desire to remain as shareholders in a private Tesla is of critical importance to me. They are the ones who believed in Tesla when no one else did and they are the ones who most believe in our future. I told the board that I would report back after I had these discussions.""Musk says his communications via Twitter are as a potential bidder, not on behalf of the company. Furthermore, he says he left the meeting with the Saudi fund reps with no doubts a deal could be closed (""funding secured"") due to the fund's willingness to invest more than 5% in Tesla to take it private.

 Auto exports to China set a record $7.4B last month, but the benefit went to European and Japanese companies as U.S. automakers were blocked from the gains due to China's addition of the retaliatory 25% tariff on U.S.-built vehicles. A tariff cut to 15% from 25% which does not include U.S. automakers encouraged foreign manufacturers to ship 165K cars into China last month, breaking the previous record of 134K set in July 2014.

 Reviews of the Tesla Motors (TSLA +6.5%) Model X are starting to pile in as consumers receive their long-awaited electric crossovers and the company's Meet the Model X tour of 30 cities progresses. Most anecdotal reviews have been positive, although major breakdowns from automobile industry heavyweights are still missing (see Car & Driver's take after a short spin). One of the most interesting early reports is from Dragtimes.com. In a duel between the Model X P90D (Ludicrous) and the Model S P90D (Ludicrious), the X set what Dragtimes calls a ""world record"" for the SUV/CUV category with a 3.1 second zero-to sixty mph time.

SolarCity (SCTY) COO Tanguy Serra has been named the company's new CFO. He replaces Brad Buss, whose pending retirement was announced in November, along with news Serra has been promoted to President.
Meanwhile, SolarCity has added to Wednesday's huge post-earnings losses following a ' to Equal-Weight from Barclays' Jon Windham. He's worried about SolarCity's soft Q1 installation guidance, rising funding costs, and the potential for a pending Supreme Court ruling to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan. SolarCity rival Sunrun (RUN -12.4%) has also been downgraded to Equal-Weight, and is seeing even bigger losses.
Windham, whose SolarCity target has been cut by $29 to $20, adds markets are currently averse to companies relying on externally-financed growth, and thus unlikely to grant ""significant value to long-term value creation for the residential installers in the near-term.���
Raymond James' Pavel Molchanov went contrarian yesterday and upgraded SolarCity to Strong Buy. He argued the market's reaction to the guidance was excessive ""since the quarterly [installation] progression is always back-end-loaded,"" and that SolarCity's valuation is now far more compelling. ""Put simply, for the first time in its three-plus years as a public company, SCTY shares are trading at a discount to the current [net present value]/share figure. That is to say, the stock is currently pricing in zero credit for any future expansion in NPV.""

 Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is holding onto gains in early trading action after setting delivery guidance high and striking a confident tone that it will have a profitable year (non-GAAP adjusted). Bold talk from the EV automaker is nothing new, but a plan to invest in future growth without utilizing outside capital sources is calming some fears.

By a 3-2 vote, the California PUC has upheld the state's solar net metering policy, which credits solar users for electricity delivered back to the grid. New net metering customers will have to pay an interconnection fee, along with charges on power drawn from the grid to support public purpose programs. The PUC will revisit net metering in 2019.
In stark contrast to December's Nevada PUC ruling, trade group SEIA is quite pleased with California's decision. Investors in top U.S. residential solar installers SolarCity (SCTY +8.4%) and Sunrun (RUN +15.9%) seem happy too.

SolarCity (SCTY) is a standout on a good morning for both the Nasdaq (up 1.1%) and energy-related names - WTI crude is up 7.7% to $34.77/barrel amid growing hopes of Saudi/Russian oil production cuts.
The gains come on a day California's PUC is expected to vote on a final net metering rate plan (previous) for the state's solar installations; California remains by far SolarCity's biggest market. Greentech Media: ""So far, we���ve seen little sign that commissioners are going to reconsider the key solar-friendly points of last month���s proposed decision -- namely, retaining retail-rate compensation for customers' surplus solar power and rejecting additional fees for net-metered solar systems."" Unlike with December's Nevada PUC ruling, local utilities aren't happy with the California proposal.
Roth Capital has reiterated a Buy rating and $65 target on SolarCity today, arguing risk/reward is favorable following a major early-2016 decline. The firm cautions it doesn't think SolarCity will be ""out of the woods"" until the California net metering decision arrives.
Q4 results are due on the afternoon of Feb. 9. SolarCity plunged three months ago in response to the 2015/2016 installation guidance given with its Q3 results. Since then, post-2016 expectations have grown thanks to the ITC extension.

Believing U.S. solar demand will remain strong through 2020, Barclays' Jon Windhan has launched coverage on SolarCity (SCTY) with an Overweight rating and $49 target.
Meanwhile, SolarCity says it has finished its fifth solar asset securitization, and its first securitization of distributed solar loan assets. The deal involves a $185M private placement ($2.89 per watt of solar generation capacity) featuring a 5.81% blended yield, and a 2022 anticipated payment date. S&P has rated the debt BBB (lower medium grade).
SolarCity ended Q3 with $418M in cash/short-term investments, $878M in long-term debt, $211M in solar bond debt, $796M in convertible debt, and $425M in solar asset-backed notes. Today's news may be soothing recent financing concerns - Bernstein reported last week SolarCity is mulling the direct sale of solar loans, leases, and power purchase agreements at a relatively high 7%-7.5% discount rate.
SolarCity, hammered in recent weeks along with other solar names, has risen to $34.06 premarket. Nasdaq futures are up 1.7%, and S&P futures 1.4%.

Wynne adds SolarCity expects the first sale of new solar leases and purchase agreements (PPAs) to close at a 7%-7.5% discount rate, above the 6% rate management has applied thus far when valuing its solar installation portfolio. Thus far, the company has relied on other financing sources, such as tax equity financing and the sale of solar asset-backed notes.
The first asset sale is expected to involve just 100MW-200MW of leases. Wynne: ""We would expect a $150 to $300 million asset sale at a discount rate of 7.5% to take some of the sting out of the bear arguments regarding cash flow and return on capital, but such a transaction would raise uncomfortable questions for bulls as well,""
SolarCity has tumbled below $38 on a day the Nasdaq and S&P are up 1%. Thanks in part to a market selloff, shares are now down 27% in 2016.
Separately, a backlash has been growing to the Nevada PUC's recent decision to increase connection charges and lower net metering payments for home and business solar installations, a decision that led SolarCity to pull out of Nevada. VCs and actor Mark Ruffalo are among those to have blasted the PUC's ruling.

SolarCity (SCTY) says it will be forced to ""cease sales and installation operations in Nevada"" if a proposal on solar charges is approved by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) tomorrow.

The proposal includes a two-part tariff consisting of a fixed service charge and a volume-based commodity charge, and would apply retroactively to all net metering customers (i.e. solar users being credited for electricity delivered to the grid). Local utility NV Energy had been seeking a demand charge.
The PUC is also proposing to transition all residential and small commercial net metering customers to a cost-based rate structure over the next four years to eliminate ""unreasonable"" cost shifts between ratepayers.
SolarCity: ""There is so much wrong with the decision, the only option for the PUC is to reject it. The one beneficiary of this decision would be NV Energy, whose monopoly will have been protected ... The decision would retroactively sabotage the investments Nevadans have already made in solar, even though they were encouraged by their government to make those investments.""

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has voted to keep the state's solar net metering program (credits solar panel owners for electricity they deliver to the grid) beyond 2017, while making a handful of changes.
Among them: 1) An interconnection fee (estimated at $75-$150 for new customers) will be imposed. 2) To help finance low-income and energy-efficiency programs, net metering customers will have to pay $0.02-$0.03/kWh in ""non-bypassable charges"" for electricity consumed. 3) System owners will have to adopt time-of-use electricity rates.
The CPUC is also setting up a program to provide assist solar installations by multi-family buildings, and one to help residential customers in lower-income communities to take part in net metering even if they're renters.
SolarCity (SCTY), which counts California as (by far) its largest market, has responded with a statement praising the CPUC for extending net metering, while calling its decision to require new customers to be on time-of-use rates concerning. ""As we saw in 2007 when time-of-use rates were briefly mandated for solar customers, they don't work for everyone who wants to go solar, and would reduce the motivation for installing solar.""

""We believe an acquisition of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) would make sense for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); action cameras are uniquely positioned at the intersection of Apple���s smartphone, wearables, and multimedia offerings,"" writes FBR's Daniel Ives in a note about potential Apple buyout targets.
Ives: ""Additionally, GoPro���s new product cycles could open the door to areas where Apple���s competitors are investing heavily (e.g., drones, VR), and Cupertino has been playing catch-up. We also see strategic value in GoPro being integrated with Apple���s strong multimedia ecosystem (e.g., iTunes, Apple TV, etc.).""
Media/ad software giant Adobe (ADBE - $44.4B market cap), enterprise cloud storage/file-sharing leader Box (BOX - $1.6B market cap), and EV/battery maker Tesla (TSLA - $30B market cap) are also named as potential Apple targets.��""Box would give Apple an avenue into enterprise storage and enable it to expand its product tentacles (hardware/storage) into the enterprise cloud frontier ... Adobe would provide a nice pipeline into the enterprise ... Adobe���s Document Cloud/Marketing Cloud applications are helping enterprises grapple with the growth of digital marketing, proliferation of mobile devices in the enterprise, and IOT.""
The GoPro remarks come with the action camera leader down 82% from its Oct. 2014 high of $98.47, and sporting a $2.4B market cap. In other news, GoPro announced today it has added Apple Watch support for its iOS app.

Major decliners include SolarCity (SCTY -3.9%), Canadian Solar (CSIQ -5.6%), Enphase (ENPH -8.6%), JinkoSolar (JKS -6.8%), Yingli (YGE -4.8%), China Sunergy (CSUN -4.9%), Sky Solar (SKYS -4.3%), and SunEdison's TerraForm Global (GLBL -7.1%) YieldCo.
Vivint Solar (VSLR -8.7%) is tumbling after posting mixed Q2 results (revenue beat, EPS missed). Installations rose 78% Y/Y to 66MW (in-line with guidance of 63MW-67MW), and bookings grew 40% to 73MW. In a sign investors have concerns SunEdison's (SUNE +1.5%) pending acquisition of Vivint won't close (or at least under its current terms), Vivint trades at a 22% discount to SunEdison's buyout price, even after factoring a lower stock payout to account for SunEdison's recent plunge.
Speaking of which, Deutsche's Vishal Shah has launched a spirited defense of SunEdison today, arguing the David Einhorn favorite has plenty of options to bolster shares and/or improve its capital structure.
Shah: ""First, some of the senior mgmt team members can personally buyback some stock. Second, it appears that more aggressive growth plans are a problem for the stock ... The shares would react positively if mgmt slashed devco guidance to 3GW. Third, mgmt can sell some backlog and generate cash ... Fourth, mgmt can get capital infusion from a large strategic investor that has interest in infrastructure projects ... Fifth, mgmt can restructure the IDR structure at TERP so that the drop downs in 2016 are more accretive. Sixth, mgmt could arrange additional warehouse financing ... Finally, even though it looks like a long shot, SUNE could reach an agreement to walk away from the VSLR transaction.""
SunEdison remains down 40% from where it traded before posting mixed Q2 results and (thanks to an aggressive project construction pace) op. cash flow of -$621M.

Analyst Adam Jonas says an on-time Model X could set up shares to reach an all-time high by the end of the year.
Nothing brand-new, but Jonas also says he's willing to take on the cash burn risk on the stock in order to bet on Tesla disrupting the industry.

 Kelley Blue Book sees U.S. auto sales of 16.3M units this year to rep a growth rate of 4.9%. One of the biggest risks to the industry is a bump in interest rates to a level where buyers are pushed away from purchasing new cars. Industry watchers think the luxury sector (VLKAY, BAMXY, OTCPK:DDAIF) could see the sharpest impact as consumer previously willing to stretch trade down. Ford's (F) increased use of aluminum in the widely popular F-150 line will be in focus. Analysts think could consumer reaction could go either way. Rival truck makers like Ram (FIATY) are set to pounce if the aluminum concerns show any validity. Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY) are betting big on growth in the U.S. as tensions in China continue to crop up and clip sales from climbing to full potential .The group is seen as likely to use incentives and promotions in the U.S. to gain market share if sales momentum slows. Toyota vs Telsa: Top execs with the two automakers have dialed up the rhetoric on the use of hydrogen fuel cell cars despite being long-time partners.

Shah estimates SCTY's market penetration is ~0.2% in existing markets and  thinks cumulative MW deployed can reach at least 3 GW by 2016, which  would still imply only ~1% market penetration; he says his 2016 estimates are  likely conservative as SCTY is targeting 1M customers, implying ~6 GW deployed by mid-2018.

 Despite some recent concerns on the U.S. automobile industry - including high inventory at General Motors (NYSE:GM) and pricing pressures at Ford (NYSE:F) -�� the industry is in the best shape that it's been in years, say some analysts. On demand: The average age of vehicles in the U.S. has never been higher at 11.3 years. Some pent-up demand from the fall when government shutdown worries stalled sales is also still being unleashed. On profits: Though a high level of promotional activity in December helped to juice sales figures at the expense of profits, some underlying positive trends remain in place. The increased use of domestic production in supply chains and the early success of 2014 models at premium pricing bodes well for bottom lines in the sector.

On gas mileage: Consumers will be tempted to trade into new vehicles with vastly improved gas mileage ratings. Honda (NYSE:HMC) tops the list while Ford's betting truck owners will go for a lighter F-150 in the future.
