Helmerich &��Payne (NYSE:HP) says it has formed a new business entity, H&P Technologies, to be used to drive development of advanced technologies and directional drilling automation solutions, resulting in greater reliability and well performance.
HP says a key benefit of its performance-driven drilling services is the reduced  positional uncertainty in the directional drilling process and that the technology can be used on any rig, regardless of the drilling or service provider.
HP also said it acquired Scotland-based Angus Jamieson Consulting, a software-based, training and consultancy firm.

Helmerich & Payne (HP +2.8%) is higher after SunTrust upgrades shares two notches to Buy from Sell with a $75 price target, lifted from $58, saying the recent correction in its stock price has created an attractive entry point.
While most oilfield services names anticipate a pause in activity over their upcoming few quarters, HP has the ""contracts in hand"" to continue delivering ""12 super-spec rig upgrades per quarter"" into Q2 of next year, says SunTrust's Ken Sill, who also points to the company's dividend providing downside protection for the stock price and for its ""strong balance sheet"" to provide an advantage when the new rig build cycle starts in FY 2020.
Also, Citigroup upgrades shares to Buy from Neutral with a $74 price target, up from $70, believing HP ""offers a great combination of offensive and defensive qualities,"" and Credit Suisse raises the stock to Neutral from Underperform, citing the economic benefit of superspec rigs and the surety of the dividend.

Helmerich &��Payne (HP +4.5%) is sharply higher after reporting better than expected FQ4 earnings and a 31% Y/Y revenue increase to $696M.
Q4 operating revenue in HP's U.S. Land segment jumped 33% Y/Y to $587M, with average rig revenue per operating day up 11% to $24,449, and average rig margin per day climbing 28% to $10,340; 65% utilization in Q4 vs. 55% in the year-ago quarter helped segment operating income swing to a $64.5M profit from a year-ago loss of $4.2M.
HP says it expects to see additional demand for its super-spec FlexRigs heading into the new fiscal year as customers continue to push increased lateral lengths and their use of pad drilling; it upgraded 54 FlexRigs to super-spec capacity during FY 2018, including 16 during Q4.
""The super-spec rig market in the U.S. is effectively fully utilized, and we continue to see indications that additional demand is forthcoming, even as oil prices have recently moved lower,"" says President and CEO��John Lindsay.

 Helmerich &��Payne (HP +3.2%) pushes higher after reporting better than expected FQ1 earnings and a 53% Y/Y revenue increase, HP says its contracted U.S. land rig count rose ~4% to 204 by the end of the quarter compared to a slight decline in the industry rig count, with spot pricing continuing to rise by ~4%, resulting in an 11% increase in adjusted average rig margin per day. Q2 revenue days are seen rising 1%-2%  Q/Q, representing a 3%-4% increase in the average number of  active rigs, given the lower number of calendar days during FQ2; average rig revenue per day is seen roughly flat to slightly up vs. FQ1. HP also raises its 2018 capex budget to $350M, up from a previous range of $250M-$300M. Analyzing the results, Bloomberg's Liam Denning says ""HP is in shale's sweet spot,"" citing its ~40% share of active super-spec rigs, which offer more power, can drill longer horizontal wells and move quickly from well to well to speed things up.""Having the rigs that the exploration and production industry needs means you can charge more, [which] came through"" in the quarterly results, Denning writes.

 UBS oil services analyst Angie Sedita cautions that 2016 will remain difficult in the industry, especially for offshore drillers, but she awards Buy ratings to three leading land drillers, noting that pricing weakness will remain a struggle but that land drillers typically lead the sector off the bottom. The firm says Helmerich &��Payne (NYSE:HP), Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) and Patterson-UTI��Energy (NASDAQ:PTEN) have the potential to bring patient investors solid returns in 2016 and beyond. None of the offshore drillers gain Buy ratings from Sedita and her team.  ",0.9463,positive,0.6082133333333333
