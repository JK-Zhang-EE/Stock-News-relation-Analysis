IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) November hiring of Qualcomm vet Murthy Renduchintala to head a new and massive Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group is just one of many noteworthy recent hires of outsiders, observes long-time chip analyst and Linley Group chief Linley Gwennap.
Renduchintala's arrival was preceded by the 2014 hiring of Amir Faintuch, previously the head of Qualcomm's Atheros Wi-Fi chip unit, to head Intel's Platform Engineering Group (handles chip R&D). Gwennap notes Faintuch, who once more reports to Renduchintala, has ""already brought in other outsiders such as Anwar Awad (from Synopsys), Amit Baruch (Samsung), Shawn Covell (Qualcomm), Mark Davis (Via Telecom), Charlie Matar (AMD), Ari Rauch (AMD), and Howard Wright (Qualcomm) to hold VP-level positions.""
He sees the hiring spree potentially changing a ""not invented here"" culture at Intel, and in doing so shortening chip development cycles and improving Intel's ability to go after non-core markets. A greater willingness to use ARM CPU cores (previously strongly discouraged by management) is also deemed a possibility.
Gwennap cautions such a management/culture shakeup can be disruptive and alienate employees if not handled well. ""The key is for the new managers to recognize Intel���s many strengths, including industry-leading IC technology, excellent engineers, and a broad IP portfolio. If they can harness these strengths while improving workflow and accelerating development time, Intel will have a better chance at winning in new markets.""

JMP's Alex Gauna has upgraded Intel (INTC +1.6%) to Outperform and set a $45 target a day after the chip giant guided at its 2015 investor meeting for mid-single digit 2016 revenue growth, hiked its dividend by $0.02/share, and set a $10B 2016 capex budget. Shares are close to their highest levels since January.
During his presentation (.pdf), CFO Stacy Smith guide for mid-teens Data Center Group (DCG, server CPUs/network processors) 2016 revenue growth, in-line with the 4-year CAGR forecast Intel provided last year (aided by Altera?). The Client Computing Group (CCG, PC/mobile CPUs) is expected to see flat to low-single digit sales growth, with low-double digit op. profit growth due to improved mobile CPU profitability.
Gross margin is expected to benefit from higher ASPs, and be pressured by 3D XPoint investments and 10nm start-up costs. Notably, Intel expects only 1/3 of 2016 DCG revenue to come from traditional enterprise server sales. 1/3 are expected to come from cloud service providers (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.), and 1/3 from HPC, workstation, networking, and storage systems. The CCG outlook assumes a slight decline in PC unit sales.
Sterne Agee's Doug Freedman (Buy): ""INTC highlighted non-consumer group segments make up 40% of total revenue in 2015 while contributing 65% of the operating profit ... Management noted the ongoing weakness in traditional enterprise market but continued to expect strong growth to be driven by robust demands in cloud service provider and high performance computing.""
Freedman considers capex guidance better than feared. As does Cowen's Tim Arcuri (Market Perform), who also thinks gross margin guidance is conservative.
Roth's Krishna Shankar (Buy) is a little worried about the traction seen by ARM server CPU vendors AppliedMicro (AMCC -0.4%) and Cavium (CAVM -1.1%). ""Beyond 2015, we believe that Intel���s quasi-monopoly in high-margin servers (95% market share in server platforms) may be challenged by new low-power ARM-based server platforms for the high growth cloud services, social networking/video-delivery market."" Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann (Underperform) states CEO��Brian Krzanich admitted Intel's server CPU forecast accounts for share ""degradation.""
SA author Bruce Burnworth is upbeat about DCG's growth outlook. Among other things, he notes Intel respectively sees $5B and $1.6B 2020 addressable markets for silicon photonics and Omni-Path, and a major opportunity to grow networking sales as carriers adopt network functions virtualization (NFV, involves migrating networking functions to software running on commodity hardware).

That meshes with a March VentureBeat report stating the XMM 7360 will go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Though an August Northland Securities report forecast Intel will supply modems for some iPhone 6S/6S+ units, teardowns indicate Apple is solely relying on Qualcomm's MDM9635M modem.
The MDM9635M supports 300Mbps peak download speeds, and the XMM 7360 450Mbps peak speeds. Qualcomm, whose high-end modems are generally considered to have a performance/power consumption edge, recently unveiled the X12, which supports 600Mbps peak speeds and will be integrated with its Snapdragon 820 processor.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore (Underweight) thinks some of Intel's PC ASP gains are temporary, fueled by a mix shift towards developed markets, low-end inventory burnoff, and stronger replacement rates on the high-end. Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann (Underperform) suspects DCG growth will be pressured going forward by price discounts meant to discourage clients from adopting ARM server CPUs.
On the earnings call (transcript), CFO Stacy Smith stated enterprise server demand has been weaker than expected, and cloud demand (partly coming at the expense of enterprise as cloud service adoption continues) stronger than expected. He also downplayed Intel's latest capex budget cut, suggesting the spending has simply been pushed out to 2016.

196,2015-08-12,0.441,Northland: Intel taking iPhone modem share from Qualcomm with 6S launch,"

""We now believe that Intel (INTC +0.9%) will capture roughly 50% of Apple���s modem business in the upcoming iPhones due to launch September 9th,"" writes Northland Securities' Gus Richard. ""[W]e estimate that this win could represent $750M to $1.25B in revenue for Intel in [2016]. This is a marque win for Intel and would go a long way to reducing the mobile business losses.""
At the same time, Richard is concerned Alibaba plans to deploy ARM-based (ARMH -3.3%) server CPUs developed by Cavium (CAVM -1.7%), and reports hearing Amazon, Facebook, and Google are working on their own ARM server CPU designs. Major Web/cloud service providers currently rely overwhelmingly on Intel server CPUs (primarily Xeon).
Qualcomm (QCOM -0.9%) has been the iPhone's exclusive baseband modem supplier for some time, and also sells complementary RF transceiver, power management, receive-only, and envelope-tracking ICs to Apple. VentureBeat reported in March Apple plans to use Intel modems in 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets.
Qualcomm suggested last month Apple's high-end smartphone share gains were partly responsible for its soft FQ4 (calendar Q3) guidance. However, this was generally seen as a reference to the fact Apple uses home-grown app processors (the A-series) within the iPhone rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon line. The company has dominated the 4G modem market to date, and is generally seen as having a high-end performance/power consumption edge.
Separately, Qualcomm has unveiled its next-gen GPU core architecture, the Adreno 5xx. Qualcomm promises up to 40% improvements in performance and power draw relative to the prior-gen Adreno 430. The first GPUs based on the architecture will go into the company's upcoming Snapdragon 820 (next-gen flagship) and 620/618 (mid-range) processors.
Intel is up modestly in spite of a 1% Nasdaq drop. Qualcomm is following markets lower.

On Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q2 CC (webcast), CEO Brian Krzanich stated his company doesn't plan to launch its first 10nm CPU platform until the second half of 2017. The platform, previously codenamed Cannonlake and more recently referred to as Ice Lake, was expected to arrive by late 2016 or early 2017.
Krzanich: ""The last two technology transitions have signaled that our cadence today is closer to 2翻 years than two.��� To hold users over between the its first 10nm chips and its 14nm Skylake CPUs (due later this year), Intel plans to roll out a 3rd-gen 14nm platform (codenamed Kaby Lake) in 2016. The disclosure coincides with a $1B 2015 capex budget cut.
On the bright side, Intel remains upbeat about server CPU division (DCG) sales - the company previously forecast a 15% CAGR for DCG through 2018 - and predicts Skylake and Windows 10 will drive a seasonal pickup in PC demand following a very rough Q1/Q2.
Intel is now up 1.7% AH, giving back a large chunk of the initial gains seen on account of its Q2 beat (aided on the bottom line by a low tax rate) and better-than-expected guidance.

Deutsche's Ross Seymore (Buy, $37 target) has cut his Q2, 2015, and 2016 estimates, stating PC sales remain weak and that a seasonal demand pickup aided by the launch of Windows 10 (due on July 29) and Intel's Skylake CPU platform (expected to begin rolling out in late summer) will come largely in Q4, rather than Q3.
Seymore also thinks channel inventory burn will hurt Intel's gross margin, and that the Altera deal will affect the pace of buybacks. However, he maintains ""INTC offers a favorable risk/reward at its current discount valuation and [expects] shares to appreciate as PC headwinds lessen (2H15/2016).""

The offerings take aim at Samsung, which has been shipping 3D NAND parts for several months, as well as Toshiba and partner SanDisk (SNDK - fell 18.5% today due to a Q1/2015 warning). Today, Toshiba/SanDisk announced a 48-layer 128Gb 3G NAND solution - the Intel/Micron solution features 32 layers, as do Samsung's current chips. The SanDisk/Toshiba offering relies on an advanced 15nm manufacturing process and is sampling today, but full commercial production isn't expected until 2016.
Needham's Rajvindra Gill (Strong Buy on Micron) is pleased with today's news. ""We think MU���s strategy of optimizing bits per area is the right approach in 3D NAND."" At the same time, he notes Samsung's 3D offerings deliver major endurance, performance, and power benefits relative to 2D NAND.
In other Intel-related news, the WSJ reports HP is close to selling a 51% stake in its H3C Chinese networking hardware unit to Tsinghua Unigroup. With Intel taking a 20% stake in Tsinghua last year as part of a mobile processor alliance, a deal could lead to greater use of Intel's CPUs, network processors, and switching chips within H3C's hardware.
Intel doesn't separately break out its NAND sales. The business is part of an ""All other"" reporting segment that had 2014 revenue of $2.25B (+18% Y/Y). After initially falling due to SanDisk's warning, Micron closed up 0.3% today. Intel closed up 0.6%.

Update: AnandTech estimates the Intel/Micron solution has an array efficiency (the % of the die that's dedicated to memory cells) of 85%, above the 66% and 72% respectively estimated for MLC and TLC Samsung chips. ""I now understand why Intel-Micron claim that their 3D NAND technology comes with disruptive cost because it really is the most efficient 3D NAND technology we have seen so far.""

Canaccord's Matt Ramsay has upgraded Intel (INTC -0.6%) to Buy a day after the company issued a Q1 warning blamed on weak business PC sales and lower-than-expected customer inventories. CLSA has also upgraded, albeit only to Underperform from Sell.
Ramsay: ""[W]e believe the removal of unrealistic PC expectations actually makes Intel shares more investible and the Win10/Skylake refreshes during 2H/15 could even provide modest upside to lower expectations ... We believe 15%+ [server CPU division] and 20%+ [IoT chip division] growth expectations are quite achievable for the next several years, growing non-PC sales to >50% of Intel���s revenue by 2017...""
Intel's mobile division (MCG) performance is also expected to improve, though Ramsay considers an iPhone baseband win unlikely. ""With lower platform costs and gradual LTE and SoFIA revenue ramps, we anticipate lower losses in MCG in 2015 and materially lower losses in 2016. We believe LTE connectivity in PCs could emerge as an underappreciated LTE modem driver...""

Others on the Street have reacted more cautiously, with several analysts noting Intel's forecast is backed up by negative Asian supply chain data. Susquehanna's Chris Caso thinks the euro's weakness - it's selling off again today - is playing a big role. ""Since PC component costs are all in dollars (and are priced accordingly in Euros), the exceptional Euro weakness has caused PC prices to rise dramatically in Europe.""
Meanwhile, though the warning has grabbed far more headlines, Intel has been busy this week refreshing its server CPU lineup. The company has launched Xeon D, an SoC that's based on the 14nm Broadwell architecture, sports a built-in memory controller and two 10-gig Ethernet links, and is aimed at Web servers and storage/networking hardware. Facebook's Open Compute Project has unveiled an open-source server design that relies on Xeon D.

VentureBeat reports Intel's (INTC +3.7%) recently-announced XMM 7360 4G baseband modem (made by its Infineon unit) will go into 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, thus partly taking a slot reserved for several years by Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.9%) Gobi modems.
The site adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers ""have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone,"" and that Intel ""has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones."" Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm.
The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation. Qualcomm, which still claims the lion's share of the 4G baseband market, announced a Cat-10 LTE modem (the Gobi 9x45) last November that was declared to offer better power consumption and take up less board space than the prior-gen/Cat-6 9x35.
Apple sold 193M iPhones last year, and will likely top 200M this year. As is the case with many other clients, Qualcomm's modem sales to Apple help enable the sale of several complementary parts - an RF transceiver, a power management IC, a receive-only chip, and an envelope-tracking IC that lowers power draw.
Intel is up sharply today after selling off hard yesterday amid a market rout. The chip giant has already seen 18.2M shares traded vs.a 3-month daily average of 29M.

Amazon (AMZN +4.3%) has acquired Annapurna Labs, an Israeli chipmaker that has provided few details about the silicon it's working on. The NYT reports the purchase price is $350M. The WSJ previously reported of a $350M deal price, while adding the final tab could be $375M if certain conditions are met.

Intel (INTC -0.4%) is off fractionally after providing in-line revenue guidance and a soft gross margin forecast to go with a Q4 beat. Charter Equity has downgraded to Market Perform, and Stifel (Buy) has upped its target by $2 to $41.
Not surprisingly, bulls are focusing heavily on the 25% Y/Y growth posted by Intel's server CPU unit (DCG). Jefferies: ""To say DCG is a hidden gem is an understatement ... all four segments (Enterprise, Cloud, High-Performance Computing, Networking) posted growth. We think Intel���s new server cycle (Grantley) helps in 2015, but view drivers in DCG to be largely secular.""
Also going over well: Intel's 2014 capex ($10.1B) was below prior guidance of $10.5B-$11.5B, and its 2015 guidance midpoint is only at $10B. Wells Fargo observes the 2014/2015 figures are below 2011-2013 levels of $10.7B-$11B, even though ""2015 revenue that is likely to be substantially higher than in any of these years.""
Those less positive often highlight slowing PC CPU growth. Ascendiant Capital thinks Q4 PC CPU division revenue ($8.9B, +3%) fell short of a $9.2B consensus. ""It looks as though the upgrade cycle is tapering off and we expect a return of a secular declining PC market in 2015."" Bernstein, reiterating inventory concerns: ""Intel���s [PC] unit shipments still remain well above market data on a YoY basis, and account receivable DSOs increased sharply.""
Intel has guided for PC division sales to fall by a low-single digit % in 2015, following a strong 2014 boosted by an inventory refresh and share gains against AMD (AMD -4.2%). AMD, which reports on Jan. 20, is selling off today.
On the CC (transcript) CEO Brian Krzanich stated Intel shipped 46M tablet CPUs in 2014, beating a goal of 40M, and that the company is committed to driving out $800M in mobile chip unit costs in 2015. Thanks in large part to heavy marketing subsidies, the unit posted a $4.2B 2014 op. loss.

Arguing Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) manufacturing process lead threatens Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.5%) mobile processor share, Drexel Hamilton's Rick Whittington has downgraded the mobile chip/IP giant to Hold, and cut his target by $25 to $75.
Whittington observes Intel is now selling 14nm processors - its 14nm Cherry Trail tablet CPUs recently began shipping - while Qualcomm has just begun selling 20nm processors (made by TSMC). He adds top foundries are slow to ramp 14nm and 16nm FinFET processes - Samsung/Globalfoundries are rolling out the former, TSMC the latter - and that Intel ""also appears set on commoditizing low-mid-range LTE [baseband modems] for incorporation in their mobile processor offerings, conjuring a price war.""
Worth noting: 1) While Intel has begun offering powerful app processors that leverage advanced manufacturing processes, it hasn't launched high-end baseband/app processors that can take on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 series. 2) A large portion of Intel's low-end efforts - both for app processors and baseband/app processors - are tied to alliances with Chinese chipmakers who (like Qualcomm) rely on 3rd-party foundries.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had a Q3 gross margin of 65%, +50 bps Q/Q and +260 bps Y/Y, but below a guidance midpoint of 66%. In addition, Q4 GM guidance is at 64% (+/- 2%).
In its CFO commentary (.pdf), Intel says ""higher production costs"" for its new 14nm Broadwell CPUs hurt Q3 margins. 14nm production costs are expected to fall in Q4, but that will be offset by higher platform unit costs.
A hefty $4.2B was spent on buybacks, up from $2.1B in Q2 and helping EPS beat estimates in spite of the light GM. Intel ended the quarter with $15.6B in ""cash investments,"" and $13.3B in debt.
PC CPU division revenue (boosted by strong corporate/U.S. demand) +9% Y/Y to $9.2B; op. income was $4.1B. Server CPU division revenue (boosted by Grantley and cloud data center demand) +16% to $3.7B; op. income was $1.9B.
PC CPU ASPs fell 2% Q/Q and 5% Y/Y. Server CPU ASPs fell 1% Q/Q and rose 9% Y/Y.
The mobile chip division officially had revenue of just $1M, thanks to contra revenue payments to OEMs (generally for tablet CPUs). The division reported a $1.04B op. loss.
The Internet of Things Group (embedded products) saw revenue grow 14% to $530M, and had op. profit of $153M. Software/services revenue +3% to $558M; op. profit of $29M. Everything else (inc. flash memory) had revenue of $575M (+14%), and an op. loss of $634M.

Intel's (INTC +0.4%) deal to invest up to $1.5B in a Tsinghua Unigroup holding company that owns Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics will both help it better penetrate the low-end Chinese smartphone/tablet market and allow it to sidestep antitrust regulators, thinks Rosenblatt Securities. Chinese regulators have taken aim at Qualcomm and Microsoft, among others.
Rosenblatt doubts the deal will have a big near-term impact on the mobile baseband market, but thinks it could be a long-term negative for MediaTek and Marvell (MRVL -0.7%), both of whom have sizable low-end Chinese shares. Spreadtrum/RDA foundry partner SMIC (SMI +1.4%) is seen as a possible beneficiary.
Wells Fargo observes Spreadtrum had a 16% Q2 baseband share (#3, behind Qualcomm and MediaTek), and that its Chinese share is much higher. Spreadtrum's 3G baseband share was at 11%.
On SA, ex-Intel employee Ed McKernan argues a strategy of providing Atom mobile CPU designs to 3rd-party processor vendors (such as Spreadtrum and Rockchip) could help Intel narrow its huge mobile losses.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is buying Avago's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Axxia network processor unit for $650M in cash. The deal is expected to close in Q4.
The unit was obtained by Avago through the LSI merger. It had 2013 revenue of $113M, and employs 650 people.
The acquisition broadens Intel's product line within a competitive network processor market that also features Broadcom, Marvell, Cavium, and Freescale, among others.
The chip giant bought Ethernet switch processor startup Fulcrum Microsystems in 2011, and (thanks to the Fulcrum deal) counts data center switch vendor Arista Networks among its clients. The adoption of software-defined networking (SDN - shifts network intelligence to software-based controllers)�� is expected to boost demand for off-the-shelf silicon relative to proprietary ASICs.
Notably, the Axxia line relies on ARM and IBM PowerPC CPU cores rather than x86 cores. However, the processors are often used in PCIe cards within servers running Intel x86 CPUs.

Back in May, Avago agreed to sell LSI's flash product unit to Seagate for $450M.

Whereas Intel's (INTC +1.3%) 22nm Haswell CPU architecture aims to deliver at least a 1% increase in performance for every 1% increase in power draw, its 14nm Broadwell architecture shoots for a 2% performance gain for each 1% power increase.
Together with the gains that come from smaller transistor sizes, Broadwell's power draw is improved with the help of 15% and 10% respective drops in capacitance and minimum operating voltage, and a sizable reduction in leakage.
In addition, Intel has improved the power draw of its platform controller hub (integrated within CPU packages) and voltage regulator ICs, and cut the amount of extra power required by its Turbo Boost mode.
On the performance front, Intel is aiming for a 5%+ increase in processed instructions per CPU clock cycle relative to Haswell, and will bundle an integrated GPU that supports the latest graphics APIs, thus addressing (as noted by AnandTech)  a past shortcoming.
Systems based on Intel's tablet/ultrabook-focused Core M Broadwell CPUs (previous) are expected this holiday season. Intel wants to offer Core M CPUs with only 3W-5W of max power draw - all Core M parts will be under 10W - and which can be used in fanless ~10"" tablets that are only 8mm-10mm thick. The Surface Pro 3 (uses Core i3/i5/ii7 CPUs) is only 9.1mm thick, but also contains a fan.
Stabilizing PC sales have lowered the pressure Intel faces to produce a mobile breakthrough. However, Broadwell/Core M is still pivotal to Intel's attempts to grab share from ARM-based mobile CPUs by enabling converged devices that fuse PC-like performance with low power draw and mobile-friendly form factors.

Nvidia, TI, and Altera have already announced major cash-return efforts in recent years. TI has promised to return all of its FCF to shareholders, save for funds needed to pay down debt.
Micron (just digested Elpida) and Broadcom have been more cautious, though the latter did hike its dividend in January.
Freedman downgraded Micron on Jan. 3, when shares were at $21.66. He was bullish during the company's big 2012/2013 rally.

Intel (INTC - unchanged) has received 11 PT hikes after beating Q1 EPS estimates by a penny, offering healthy Q2 gross margin guidance, and reporting mixed numbers for its new reporting units.
At the same time, B. Riley has cut shares to Neutral. The firm, which upgraded Intel in October (shares have risen 17% since), sees a rising tablet CPU mix pressuring 2H margins and is worried about ""a tough 2H14 catalyst profile at a time when [PC CPU division] Q/Q growth risks escalate.""

Pac Crest, 9 days removed from an upgrade, remains bullish on improving corporate PC demand, the potential for foundry share gains, and a ""high likelihood"" Intel's Grantley server CPU platform will boost 2015 IT spend.

Deutsche calls Intel's 2H outlook ""prudently conservative,"" given it assumes little PC seasonality, and sees growth initiatives and cost cuts unlocking EPS/FCF growth.
On the CC (transcript), Intel attributed a 61% Y/Y drop in mobile division revenue to weaker baseband chip sales - the business faces tough competition from Qualcomm and MediaTek - and contra revenue payments to OEMs adopting its tablet CPUs.
Intel expects contra payments to decline, if not end, in 2015, and is still aiming for 40M 2014 tablet CPU shipments after shipping 5M in Q1. IDC expects 2014 industry shipments of 260.9M.
Barclays' Blaine Curtis pressed management on the fact the mobile unit appears to be losing $3B-$3.5B/year. CEO Brian Krzanich insisted Intel ""has a roadmap to get to profitability,"" and that its upcoming SoFIA (low-end baseband/app processor) and Broxton (high-end app processor) platforms will help.

Citing ""upside seen in PC builds/shipments and data center demand,"" Maxim's Ashok Kumar thinks Intel (INTC +0.4%) will post Q4 revenue at the high end of its guidance range of $13.2B-$14.2B; the consensus ($13.72B) is nearly at the midpoint of that range.
Like others, Kumar thinks the corporate Windows 7 upgrade cycle is giving Intel a lift. With Microsoft ending Windows XP support in April, many firms are upgrading systems in advance. Kumar's remarks come a day after Digitimes reported TSMC is seeing order pull-ins from PC and smartphone chipmakers.
Meanwhile, Digitimes reports today Intel has scored mobile CPU wins from OEMs who have historically relied on MediaTek (popular with low-end Android OEMs), and is partnering with a variety of Chinese ""white box"" vendors.
The site previously reported Intel is planning to spend $1B in 2014 on marketing subsidies to drive Bay Trail adoption. The chip giant has set a goal of selling 40M tablet CPUs next year, up ~4x from 2013 levels.
Reviews for Intel's new Bay Trail Atom CPUs have been solid. ZDNet's James Kendrick, after trying out an Asus Bay Trail tablet: ""This tablet feels as fast as any Core processor-equipped laptop or tablet I've used with Windows 8 ... Bay Trail doesn't feel like a stripped down mobile processor, it is as fast as any processor should be.""
Does that performance spell cannibalization risk? Bay Trail CPUs list for $32-$37; many Core notebook CPUs go for over $100.

The PC orders are said to reflect ""a rebound of replenishment demand in the PC sector and an improvement in sales in the end market."" The report comes three weeks after Citi made note of improving/stabilizing PC demand, and cited it as a reason for upgrading Intel (INTC +0.7%).
Intel was hit hard last month after guiding for flat 2014 revenue/EPS growth. With IDC expecting PC unit shipments to drop 3.8% in 2014 after falling 10.1% in 2013, expectations are low.
PC sales to enterprises (aided by the Windows 7 upgrade cycle) and developed markets have been showing signs of stabilization, but sales to emerging markets continue to fall sharply. Given tablet cannibalization began affecting developed markets first, their stabilization (assuming it holds) could be a sign emerging markets will bottom somewhere in 2014.

They also state Intel is offering huge price discounts to large OEMs using its new Bay Trail Atom CPUs, and even bundling baseband chips for free, but Intel's Taiwanese unit denies those claims.
Intel has a long history of providing OEMs with marketing subsidies, and the chip giant has made it clear it's willing to spend aggressively to make up for lost time in a tablet CPU market currently dominated by MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Apple/Samsung's in-house processors.
Last week, Intel set a goal of quadrupling its tablet CPU shipments in 2014 to 40M (would be good for a 14% share based on Canalys' latest 2014 tablet forecast).
RBC, which cut shares to Hold this morning, thinks Intel is spending $800M (via shared project/R&D spend and contra revenue) to grow its mobile CPU presence, and forecasts the spending will only yield near-term op. income of $200M. Moreover, the firm sees Intel's combined notebook/mobile processor sales posting only a 3% CAGR from 2013-2016, as soaring Atom sales are offset by declining sales of traditional PC CPUs.

Separately, Krzanich states Intel is looking to grow its nascent foundry business, even by taking on 3rd-party mobile chipmakers as clients. Many have speculated Intel, which has already shown a willingness to manufacture ARM-based processors for foundry clients, will try to reel in Apple.
As with mobile CPUs, Intel is banking on its manufacturing process lead to take foundry share (industry giant TSM will remain a formidable rival). Intel has landed FPGA vendor Altera as a client, and reportedly also has a deal with Cisco.

At Intel's (INTC +2.2%) annual investor day (webcast), CEO Brian Krzanich has promised his company will quadruple its tablet CPU shipments in 2014, as it makes an all-out push to gain share in a market expected by Gartner to see 263M shipments next year.
Intel is counting on its historical manufacturing process lead to grow rapidly in a market where a large portion of device shipments feature in-house Apple and Samsung CPUs, and where Qualcomm (QCOM - just unveiled a new flagship processor) and MediaTek (just launched an 8-core processor) have respectively carved out decent positions on the high-end and low-end.
OEMs are in the midst of launching tablets featuring Intel's Bay Trail Atom CPU, which offers big performance gains over the prior-gen Clover Trail. Intel is reportedly planning a slew of mobile CPU launches for 2014. Krzanich asserts an Atom platform due in 2015, codenamed Broxton, will allow OEMs to quickly swap in new CPUs.
Also: Intel will launch a low-end smartphone processor (codenamed SoFIA) in 2H14 that fuses an Atom CPU with a 4G baseband modem. Qualcomm's ability to integrate baseband and app processors (for both high-end and low-end products) has given it a huge edge with many OEMs thus far.

Jefferies argues Intel's transistor tech lead will give it a mobile power consumption edge over ARM-based rivals (such as Qualcomm and MediaTek). Bay Trail is the first Intel mobile CPU to use the company's tri-gate (3D) transistors (they've been included in PC CPUs since 2012).

However, Needham (Hold) doesn't like the Q4 guidance and the Broadwell delay. The firms also claims Intel's server CPU sales still missed its Q3 estimate by $100M, and thinks the business could come short of a company target for 10%+ 2013 growth.

H-P (HPQ -1.4%), which has already launched Android-powered desktops and tablets/convertibles, is doubling down on its bet by rolling out four more Android models: the Slate 8 Pro, the Slate 7 HD, the Slate 10 HD, and the Slate 7 Extreme.
The Slate 7 Extreme is based on Nvidia's (NVDA -0.6%) Tegra Note reference design, which Nvidia announced yesterday. As specified by the design, the Extreme has a 7"" 1280x800 display, stylus, dual cameras and quad-core Tegra 4 CPU; Nvidia has suggested Note tablets will sell for $199.
The Slate 8 Pro also sports a Tegra 4 chip, along with an 8"" 1600x1200 display and iPad-like 4:3 aspect ratio. The Slate 7 and 10 HD each have 1280x800 displays and dual-core CPUs from an unspecified supplier.
Two Windows 8 tablets/convertibles are also launching, both of which feature Intel's (INTC -0.2%) new quad-core Bay Trail Atom CPU. The Pavillion 11 x2 has an 11.6"" 1366x768 display and up to 128GB of storage, and starts at $600. The Omni 10 has a 10"" 1080p display and 64GB of storage; no word on pricing.

Also announced by H-P: the Spectre 13 x2 convertible, which has a 13"" 1080p display and (according to H-P) is the first PC with an Intel Haswell CPU that doesn't need a fan, and the Envy 17, the first notebook with a Leap Motion gesture-recognition sensor built in.
H-P's PC sales fell 11% Y/Y in the July quarter, thanks to weak industry sales and tough price competition from the likes of Lenovo and Dell. Notebook sales fell 14%, and desktops 9%.

Credit Suisse (Outperform) has raised its Intel (INTC +1.6%) PT to $30 from $28, and argues accelerating Data Center Group (DCG - Xeon server CPUs) growth will boost the chip giant's bottom line.
In Q2, DCG had a $1.23B op. profit on just $2.74B in revenue. By comparison, Intel's PC CPU unit needed $8.1B in revenue to generate a $2.66B op. profit and the Other Intel Architecture Group (inc. Atom/Infineon mobile chips and embedded products) lost $608M on revenue of $942M.
CS' PT hike comes in a month where Intel has begun shipping its Avoton Atom server CPUs, and launched 22nm Xeon CPUs meant for dual-CPU servers. Next year, the company plans to roll out low-power Xeon CPUs that integrate a large amount of I/O and networking functionality.

Evercore reiterated an Underperform yesterday, stating (among other things) PC trends ""remain choppy"" and that higher Xeon ASPs are offset by aggressive pricing for Avoton. The firm sees competition from ARM-based server CPUs (I, II) pressuring Intel's high Xeon ASPs and margins over time.
Software support, though improving, remains a near-term roadblock to large-scale ARM server CPU adoption.

291,2013-09-13,0.685,Intel reportedly buys natural language startup; more on Jefferies' upgrade,"


TechCrunch reports Intel (INTC +3%) has acquired Indisys, a Spanish developer of natural language-processing software, for a price above $26M.
Indisys, a 10-year-old company, has applied its natural language tech to creating mobile virtual assistant, contact center, and search engine, and social network analysis apps, among other products.
Intel's purchase comes as Apple (Siri), Google (Now), and most recently Microsoft (Cortana) each make big investments in voice assistant platforms. Voice-recognition mainstay Nuance (NUAN -0.7%), which helps power Siri, isn't standing idly either.
Voice/gesture recognition is clearly an area of interest for Intel. The company bought gesture-recognition startup Omek in July, and declared at IDF PCs featuring its gesture-recognition tech will arrive in 2014.
Meanwhile, Jefferies' Mark Lipacis, who upgraded Intel to Buy this morning, declares the chip giant ""offers one of the best alpha generation opportunities in semis,"" and praises its efforts to finally leverage its manufacturing leadership to make CPUs ""that are lower power, higher performance and cheaper than competitive solutions.""
It isn't clear yet that Intel's new Bay Trail Atom tablet CPUs will be cheaper or less power-hungry than comparable ARM-based parts, but if Intel's benchmarks are close to accurate, they should have a performance edge.

On the first day of the Intel Developer Forum (INTC +0.4%), the chip giant has unveiled Quark, an SoC meant for embedded/wearable devices that's said to be 1/5 the size of a standard Atom CPU and 10x more power-efficient. Quark is expected to ship next year; a version of the chip meant for medical applications will be ingestible.
The announcement comes as smartwatch design activity heats up; Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Gear last week, and Qualcomm showed off its Toq reference smartwatch (built with the goal of driving chip/display sales). Smartwatch developers have been almost uniformly relying on ARM-based CPUs thus far.
Intel also says its next-gen, 14nm, Broadwell PC CPUs (due in 2H14) are already showing a ""30% power improvement"" over the current-gen Haswell in tests. Haswell itself has delivered big battery life improvements over the prior-gen Ivy Bridge.
Also of note: 1) Intel promises sub-$100 tablets (presumably Android-based) will arrive this holiday season; the company had previously promised sub-$200 laptops. 2) Intel has launched new Ivy Bridge Core i7 desktop CPUs, and new low-power Haswell Core i3 notebook CPUs.

The decline is a little better than Q1's 5% drop, but still points to a bleak demand environment, as enterprise attempts to improve server efficiency (via consolidation and virtualization) and a mix shift towards cheaper, white-label servers preferred by Internet/cloud companies hurt sales. (PR)

GPU archrivals AMD (AMD +3.4%) and Nvidia (NVDA +4.3%) close higher on a moderately down day for tech. The release of Jon Peddie's Q2 GPU figures could be a factor.
The research firm estimates GPU shipments rose 4.6% Q/Q in Q2 even as PC shipments fell 2.5%. This is attributed to growing consumer interest in ""double-attach"" systems featuring both a discrete GPU and a CPU with an on-board GPU (most of Intel and AMD's latest CPUs have one).
Integrated GPUs have been taking share from discrete GPUs for a long time. Thus, any favorable data regarding discrete demand is likely to be well-received.
Counting integrated GPUs, Intel (INTC +0.2%) is estimated to have a 62% GPU share in Q2, up from 61.1% in Q1 and unchanged Y/Y. AMD is given a 21.9% share, up from Q1's 20.6% but down from 22.7% a year ago. Nvidia is assigned a 16.1% share, down from 18.3% in Q1 but up from 14.8% a year ago.
Nvidia recently released July quarter figures that pointed to Y/Y share gains.
Also: In what could prove a positive for AMD, Digitimes reports game console chip orders for September and October have already come in, and that orders are expected to stay strong November/December. Much, of course, depends on how consumers respond to the actual PS4 and Xbox One launches.
