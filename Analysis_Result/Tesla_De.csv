 Oppenheimer updates on the latest EV trends after taking in The Battery Show that took place in Detroit yesterday and factoring in U.S. auto sales reports. The analyst team says numerous approaches are being pursued within the industry to drive battery cell cost below $100/kwh to help enable broader EV adoption. Research efforts highlighted at the Detroit event included new advances in improving battery lifetime and developing batteries with faster charging times. On the commercial side of the EV market, Oppenheimer sees buses as the first ""compelling"" application for EVs, followed by medium-duty vehicles for last-mile delivery. Long-haul trucking EV testing is seen going on for another few years. EV adoption is seen leading to significant savings for some companies with the right business model to take advantage.Key suppliers to commercial EV manufacturers identified by Oppenheimer include BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), Cummins (NYSE:CMI), EnerSys (NYSE:ENS), Maxwell Technologies (NASDAQ:MXWL) and Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) - all of which are rated at Outperform.As far as EV penetration into the passenger car market, the firm notes that U.S. EV unit sales increased 120% Y/Y in August to account for 2.47% of all light-vehicle sales vs. 1.12% a year ago. BEV unit sales increased 212.6% Y/Y during the month, while PHEVs increased 25.7% Y/Y.

It could be a good thing,"" he added.Citron short-seller Andrew Left is the latest to call for Tesla to hire a chief operating officer to peel away duties from Musk. Despite being involved in a lawsuit with Tesla, Left sees Musk helping Tesla in a visionary capacity, instead of managing the Model 3 ramp. Several Wall Street analysts and former GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz are already on record saying the hiring of a COO by the EV automaker��could spark a rally.Nomura definitely thinks the Musk factor is a drag on Tesla's share price, instead of accounting for the hefty premium it once did. ""The issue though is the erratic behavior of C.E.O. Elon Musk. During the second quarter, the switch seemingly flipped. . . . We are worried that this behavior is tainting the Tesla brand, which in terms of value is most important,"" notes analyst Romit Shah.Count on Vanity Fair's Maya Kosoff to sum it up nicely: ""Are Tesla investors simply betting on the company, or are they gambling on Elon Musk, the man? The answer, of course, depends on Musk himself. As long as he refuses to delegate responsibility, it would seem that a gamble on Tesla is very much a gamble on its C.E.O.""If nothing else there is a general consensus that Tesla's share price is more closely interwoven with how investors feel about the company's CEO than your typical stock.

Cutting right to the case, Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer says Tesla will need to secure profitability by the end of the year to maintain solvency.Dorsheimer and the Canaccord team slides the price target on Tesla to $316 from $336. After looking at Tesla's current financial status, Bond Angle's Vicki Bryan maintains an Underperform rating on the company's 5.3% Senior Note issue due in 2025. Bryan also raises an interesting point by noting that Tesla may have damaged its ability to persuade convertible bondholders to accept stock instead of cash under a general consent solicitation scenario aimed at relieving some cash flow pressure for the company. She notes that the recent turmoil may make it more difficult for Tesla to float the offer. Shares of Tesla are down 1.90% to $313.20 in early trading.  ",0.9715,positive,0.6888558869701726

 The Model 3's profitability is a critical issue for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and UBS analysts say the company would lose about $2,300 per car if it sells the vehicle at its long-promised $35,000 price tag while a more expensive version at $42,000 would eke out a $670 profit. The Model 3 price currently ranges from $49,000 to about $80,000, and UBS estimates Tesla's operating profit is $3,420 per vehicle at the low end of the range, which would help explain why CEO��Elon Musk is forecasting a profit in Q3. The lack of a $35,000 base model in Tesla���s lineup, as well as early demand for the more expensive versions, should set up the company for its best quarter of profitability from the vehicle ahead of less-costly versions down the road that will reduce the lineup���s margins, says Colin Langan, who wrote the UBS report. ���Q3 is Tesla���s best shot because of this pricing dynamic,��� Langan said of the company's profitability. ���I���m very clear that I don���t think that���s sustainable.��� ",0.9845,positive,0.6888558869701726

He poses three possibilities: ""(1) some portion of warranty  expenses are being accrued in 'Services and Other', though we note that  TSLA's overall warranty accruals appear generous vs. other  manufacturers, and the company states that it includes all warranty  expense in its Automotive segment; (2) post warranty work is high and  being done for free, resulting in limited Services revenues but  escalating COGS; or (3) there is some other incremental service cost  associated with Model 3 (given that Service revenues and COGs appeared  to diverge at the time of Model 3 ramp).""Sacconaghi reaffirms his Market Perform rating and $265 price target on the shares.

 Global automakers are pressuring China to ease off the electric vehicle sales quotas in the nation. Associations representing 70% of all global auto production want the EV quotas delayed by one to three years. Current China regulations maintain that automakers must sell enough EVs or hybrids to generate ""credits"" equivalent to 8% of sales by 2018, 10% by 2019 and 12% by 2020. Those targets are seen as out of reach for some automobile companies. The Chinese automobile market has had a steady year so far, with a 1.6% volume increase at the halfway point to follow up on last year's 16% pop. China is by far and away the largest auto market in the world, more than 50% bigger than the U.S. market and more than five times larger than both the Japan and Germany markets.

 General Motors (NYSE:GM) sent a strong message across the EV industry today when it released a range estimate of 238 miles for its all-electric Chevy Bolt. That mark more than stood up in a road test of the Bolt by the Los Angeles Times. Automobile reporter Charles Fleming successfully made the challenging 240.5 mile test drive from Monterey to Santa Barbara on a warm day (AC kicked in) on a single charge. He reports that the onboard computer indicated he even had another 50 miles of range, although the trip wasn't made at maximum highway speed. Other observations from the Bolt test run are posted below. ""The Bolt EV was instantly likable. It���s quiet, comfortable and very easy to drive."" ""On city streets, the 60-KwH Bolt EV is peppy, applying ready torque to stop-and-go driving. On the highway, it settles into a calm purr."" ""The Bolt sits high and is shaped like an SUV. The generous use of glass allows extremely good visibility."" ""The Bolt���s regenerative braking system, which captures energy on downhill stretches, gave back another 10 miles of range before I hit the 101 again north of Santa Barbara.""The early reaction to the Bolt introduction will be of high interest to Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) which has a strong record of its own with performance reviews.

The publication also suggests the name should be changed, with ""Autopilot"" seen as misleading and dangerous. Another tip offered up is that Tesla should stop beta testing until critical systems are fully ready. Just last year, CR raved about Tesla's Model S P85D when it earned the highest road test score ever recorded -- and the Model S has won the highly-acclaimed Car of the Year award -- but the magazine has only given Tesla average scores on reliability in the past.

 Analysis on a cheaper Model X from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is pouring in fast and furious. With Wall Street firms handcuffed to their published ratings, some of the best early takes are from automobile industry blogs. The Gas2 site��observes that the performance of the new reduced-price Model X is very close to the other options. A buyer only gets an extra 37 miles in driving range for the additional $9K on the higher-priced X. Autoblog's take: ""Given Tesla's recent tendency to sell 'smaller' battery packs with some of the capacity limited by software, whether the 60D is really a 75D in disguise remains to be seen."" It's also a fair point that Tesla was rather quiet about this announcement compared to some of its updates. There's plenty of positive feedback on the Model X development as well. A starting price point of under $75K and lease payments as low as $800 bring a lot more buyers into the equation, notes industry watchers. Tesla needs that demand to scale up as planned.Previously: Tesla to offer cheaper Model X version (July 13) Tesla is down 0.45% to $223.63 in early trading.  ",0.9577,positive,0.6888558869701726

 Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is holding a a second conference call this morning to add more details on the SolarCity (SCTY) deal. Musk begins by explaining how a consumer with a PowerWall, solar panels, and car-charging infrastructure will be able to do a single install after making a bundled purchase. ""If we didn���t do this, it would make Tesla���s execution harder and worse,"" he adds. There isn't a great amount of granular detail on Tesla's debt load. ""Cash flow covers what���s required with the recourse debt,"" he maintains. As the Q&A goes on, Musk's insistence that the deal must happen if Tesla and SolarCity are to scale up adds intrigue to what would happen if either board voted down the combination. Just last night, Credit Suisse forecast only a 20% to 40% chance of the deal closing. On Wall Street, perma-bulls like Global Equities are backing the deal wholeheartedly, while Oppenheimer has downgraded Tesla to Market Perform from Outperform.

Meanwhile, Avondale's Michael Morosi lowered his price target to $30 from $40 and downgraded shares to Market Perform. He's waiting for some strategic clarity as the company may be pivoting to a tack that implies lower growth and market share.

The publication deduces that Apple is considering German manufacturing and will partner with supplier Magna International (MGA +0.8%).
Germany isn't completely foreign territory for Apple as it dabbles with EV car possibilities. Last year, CEO Tim Cook met with BMW (BAMXY) execs and toured an i3 manufacturing site in Leipzig. Earlier today, Electrek reported that former Tesla (TSLA -4.3%)��VP of vehicle engineering Chris Porritt moved to Apple to work on the company's EV project. The publication speculates that Porritt could be a candidate to head Project Titan which has been operating in a leadership void since Steve Zadesky stepped down.

 Motor Trend issues an exhaustive look at what an Apple Car might look like and feature in a freshly-posted story. The focus is on guesswork, not concrete details from Cupertino. A panel of experts concludes that the BMW (BAMXY) i3 isn't there yet and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is ""kinda there"" in terms of creating the electric vehicle that is the true game changer. Their vision of the Apple Car sounds pretty much like what major automakers such as Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are already talking about with the focus on mobility, simplicity, autonomous features, and connected options, Even if Apple's Project Titan is ultimately canceled, the Motor Trend panel still thinks some Apple features such as augmented reality windshields could survive.

 The SAE 2016 World Congress is underway in Detroit with a large number of automakers and suppliers in attendance. An early theme from the event is the widespread acceptance of electric cars as an inevitability in the future. General Motors (GM -0.4%) R&D chief Larry Burns presented a slide showing the ""New Automotive DNA"" of electric drive, electric motors, and diverse energy sources (Twitter picture of slide). He also noted that the company expects driverless cars to be cheaper due to the lower cost parts. Self-driving cars are seen having some commercial applications even if broad acceptance is far-fetched. The powertrain manager at Toyota (TM +3.3%) said the automaker sees EVs, fuel cells, and hybrids ""dominating"" the industry. Strong words from the world's largest seller of cars.
What to watch: Upcoming talks at the conference on cybersecurity take on added significance with nearly every automaker hyping its connected car concept. Ward's Auto is covering the event on its Twitter feed.

Unlike some of his peers, Langan doesn't see the March 31 Model 3 reveal as a potential catalyst for shares. His take is that even a wildly positive response to the Model 3 details creates problems with short-term demand for the Model S.

Up big last week thanks to the ITC extension, SolarCity (SCTY -5.4%), Sunrun (RUN -12.3%), Solar3D (SLTD -3.3%), and RGS Energy (RGSE -6.5%) have sold off as Nevada's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) weighs a proposal to increase connection charges and lower net metering payments (i.e. payments for electricity delivered to the grid) to the state's residential and commercial solar users.
SolarCity has threatened to pull out of Nevada, and other installers have also blasted the proposal, which would grant a victory to Berkshire Hathaway-owned utility NV Energy. Nevada has less than 1% of the U.S. population, but (for obvious reasons) accounts for a larger % of solar generation.

It's no secret Chanos has been short Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG), and it sounds like he remains so.
As for the price of oil, he's got no price target, but he's a bear. If he were OPEC, he says, he'd be pumping out as much oil as possible today because it might be worth even less in 15 years.

""We think it is extremely unlikely that a single person or even a small company that lacks extensive engineering validation capability will be able to produce an autonomous driving system that can be deployed to production vehicles,"" says Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in a response to yesterday's Bloomberg article about the efforts of software engineer George Hotz (was reportedly offered a job by Elon Musk) to create a self-driving system.
Tesla: ""[Such a system] may work as a limited demo on a known stretch of road -- Tesla had such a system two years ago -- but then requires enormous resources to debug over millions of miles of widely differing roads. This is the true problem of autonomy: getting a machine learning system to be 99% correct is relatively easy, but getting it to be 99.9999% correct, which is where it ultimately needs to be, is vastly more difficult.""
The company adds its autopilot system was developed in-house, and isn't an example of repackaging a supplier's technology. ""Tesla Autopilot includes radar, ultrasonics, GPS/nav, cameras and real-time connectivity to Tesla servers for fleet learning. Going forward, we will continue to use the most advanced component technologies, such as Mobileye���s (MBLY +3.7%) vision chip, in our vehicles. Their part is the best in the world at what it does and that is why we use it.""
Mobileye is rebounding a day after selling off in the wake of the Bloomberg article and a Citron Research tweet calling the company is 2016 short of the year. Aside from Tesla's remarks, a defense by Raymond James' Tavis McCourt (Outperform rating) could be helping out.
McCourt: ""We would note that Mobileye���s development of algorithms for autonomous driving also utilizes artificial intelligence, deep learning, and all the latest and greatest buzzwords ... from what we can tell from the article, Hotz is utilizing very similar development technology as Mobileye, but with 1/100th the number of engineers and giving Mobileye a 16-year head start. The solution also does not appear to be price-disruptive as Hotz mentions a $1,000 price point in the article. All-in costs of Mobileye single-camera solutions (including tier-1 integration) is roughly $100 today, so an eight-camera configuration for autonomous driving would likely be at or even cheaper than what Hotz appears to be proposing.""
He adds that while Tesla is selling its autopilot solution as a $3,000 add-on, he suspects the company's gross margin for the offering is ""well over 95%.""

468,2015-04-30,-6.4,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles peers through the looking glass,"
 A 25-page thesis from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles titled ""Confessions of Capital Junkie"" presents the case that automakers need to consider consolidating through mergers. The automobile industry is set up for failure unless costs from R&D and regulatory changes can be shared on a larger scale, according to the company. ""Capital consumption rate by OEMs is unacceptable���it is duplicative, does not deliver real value to consumers and is pure economic waste,"" reads the presentation. There's even a slide with a quote from Alice in Wonderland to hammer home the automaker's main points on the need for M&A. Today, Ford CEO��Mark Fields told CNBC the company isn't looking for a merger within the auto space. Similar comments have been made by execs with General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota in the recent past.

Following years of oversupply, a solar module shortage might emerge in 2H15 thanks to rising demand, Canadian Solar (CSIQ +5.3%) CEO Shawn Qu tells Bloomberg.
He notes Canadian (relies heavily on Chinese plants) plans to expand its module capacity to 3.5GW from a current 3GW, and its cell capacity by 400MW to as much as 2GW. Bloomberg has forecast global installations will rise to 57.2GW in 2015 from 40GW in 2013.
Qu also reiterates Canadian's plans to do an IPO a solar project YieldCo, and says it could arrive in 2H15. The YieldCo will contain low-risk U.S., U.K., Canadian, and Japanese projects.
Chinese module makers Trina (TSL +3.4%), JA Solar (JASO +3.9%), and JinkoSolar (JKS +2.8%) have joined Canadian in rallying on a quiet day for equities. U.S. solar installers SolarCity (SCTY +2.2%) and Vivint (VSLR +2.2%) are also higher, as is solar optimizer/inverter maker (and SolarCity/Vivint supplier) SolarEdge (SEDG +3.9%).

 A detailed presentation��Tesla Motors(TSLA) made to the California Public Utilities Commission last December and new documents filed with the regulator are getting closer looks��with the company's April 30 announcement drawing closer. Powertrain business exec Mateo Jaramillo outlined various goals and challenges with grid-connected batteries at the CPUC workshop. Environmental groups and brokerage firm analysts have also been briefed by Tesla on the battery storage initiative, while Wal-Mart is participating in a test of some of Tesla's battery systems.

471,2015-04-20,-1.52,Bloomberg: Google had $6B deal to buy Tesla in 2013,"

What could have been: With Tesla (TSLA -0.5%) in dire straits in March 2013 as the company struggled to fix Model S bugs and convert pre-orders into actual sales, Elon Musk reached out to Larry Page and ""proposed that Google (GOOG +1.6%) buy Tesla outright,"" Bloomberg's Ashlee Vance reports through an excerpt from a Musk book due out on May 19.
Vance adds Tesla would've cost Google $6B at the time after factoring ""a healthy premium"" - Tesla's market cap is currently $25.9B. As part of the deal, Musk wanted Google to promise to invest $5B in factory expansions and let Musk run Tesla for 8 years, until it was ready to launch a mass-market car.
While ""Musk, Page, and Google���s lawyers negotiated the specific terms of the deal"" in the following weeks, Tesla's Model S sales began to take off, and the company posted its first profit and repaid its DOE loan. No longer needing a white knight, Musk broke off talks.
A $6B Tesla acquisition would've been one of Google's largest, surpassed in size only by Motorola Mobility. Google, of course, has kept pushing ahead with its self-driving car efforts since 2013; the company has said it's talking with GM, Ford, Toyota, and others about bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. Tesla has some interest in this space as well.
Last year, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Musk met with Apple M&A execs in 2013. Apple's reported car efforts have fueled fresh speculation the company will make a bid for Tesla.

FY15 and FY16 EPS estimates are set by MS at -$2.30 and $1.40 vs. consensus $0.58 and $3.99, respectively. Morgan sees Tesla delivering 51K vehicles this year to miss the 55K units it guided to deliver. Most Model X deliveries will be in Q4, predicts analyst Adam Jonas. There's been some hyperbole out of MS on Tesla in the past which increases the drama of extending out the profitability and Model X forecasts.

 A Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) conference call today focused heavily on software upgrades and self-driving car features. The company announced a new over-the-air software update will include a range assurance alert to guide Model S drivers when they need to recharge. The feature will make it nearly impossible to run out of range, promises CEO Elon Musk.
The CEO calls driving range of 250 miles to 300 miles the ""sweet spot"" for the EV industry. A trip planner will also be an add-on. The upgrade will unveil Tesla's automatic emerging braking feature which will be included in all future models. Blind spot and collision warnings are part of the new platform as well as auto steering. The EV automaker shows it's near the lead in the autonomous driving car race with a new ""summon"" feature that will bring your car to you. Self-parking is also an option. The Model X will arrive this summer, says Musk. No company financial information was discussed during the call. Shares of Tesla are down 1.23% to $198.45 and sit on their lows.

 It's been a quiet week so far with Tesla Motors (TSLA -0.2%) as investors wait to see what a driving range update on Thursday is all about. Several analysts have suggested the software upgrade will include an improved frequency modulation technique (DC to AC conversion) which could boost the range of Tesla Model S vehicles. Global Equities Research thinks Tesla engineers have some patent applications (#20140253023, #20140209344, #20140152315, #20140153150, #20130328531, #20130307491) pending that could give the EV��company an advantage over other auto manufacturers with its inverter technology. An advanced reporting system or a new charging partnership have also been teed up as potential ways Tesla may tackle the issue of driving range anxiety.

 Tesla Motors (TSLA -1.3%) reassigns Jerome Guillen to a customer-satisfaction position away from duties as the automaker's global sales chief. The company is looking to hire separate executives to head sales operations in Asia, North America, and Europe. Deutsche Bank reduced EPS estimates on Tesla in a revision based in part on foreign currency action. 2011 EPS is taken to $0.11 from $0.52 and 2016 goes to $1.75 from $2.00. Long-term potential on Buy-rated Tesla overrides the short-term F/X impact, according to DB. A video note from Morgan Stanley isn't particularly helpful. Tesla shares could multiple by 10X or lose half their value during a wild ride, surmises MS.

478,2015-03-13,-2.39,Solar inverter/power optimizer maker SolarEdge sets IPO price range,"

SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), an Israeli maker of power converters and related inverters for solar systems, has set a $16-$18 price range for its 7M-share IPO. That spells a valuation range of $610M-$686M. (prospectus)

SolarEdge's systems replace traditional solar junction boxes with DC/DC converters (referred to by the company as power optimizers) attached to individual solar panels; the converters optimize power output by tracking each module's maximum power point. They also feature DC/AC inverters that are simpler and cheaper than traditional inverters (since power tracking and voltage management is handled by the power optimizers), and Web-based system monitoring software.
The company had revenue of $140.3M (+141% Y/Y) during the six months ending Dec. 31, and net income of $5.9M. Shipped products went into 389MW of systems, up from 153MW a year earlier.
SolarCity (SCTY) is SolarEdge's biggest client: The U.S. solar installer accounted for 32.3% of revenue during the aforementioned timeframe. Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR) is also a customer.
Top microinverter maker Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a major rival. SolarEdge claims its systems are cheaper, more reliable, and offer better shade tolerance than microinverter-based systems (among other things).

The recall only involved 2.5K vehicles - a minor amount compared to the high-profile GM (ignition switch) and Honda (airbag) recalls over the last year. Details on the RAV4 EV issue are limited as automakers typically clam up when asked for breakdowns on recall costs and supplier relationships.

TSLA���s online ordering tool this week shows the P85D is available for delivery in late March, while the $71K-and-up single-electric motor Model S is first available in May.

 Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) announces it delivered 9,834 vehicles in Q4. 11,627 vehicles were produced, leading the company to hit a 2014 production target of 35K Model S units.
Q4 results were hurt by delayed Model S P85D deliveries caused by ""a combination of customers being on vacation, severe winter weather and shipping problems."" The company also blames ""one-time manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of P85D and Autopilot functionality, and the impact of the strong dollar.""
Tesla expects to ship 55K Model S and X units in 2015, yielding more than a 70% Y/Y increase in deliveries. 40% of the deliveries are expected in the first half of the year.
Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 26.7% vs. 23.0% in Q3 and 25.2% a year ago. Automotive gross margin was 22%. Operating expenses rose 15% from Q3 to $297M.
Q1 production is only expected to be at 10K vehicles, and deliveries at 9.5K (+47% Y/Y). Automotive gross margin is expected to be at 26%, and operating expenses are expected to rise 12%-15% from Q4.

It���s pretty clear why many energy stocks are hurting amid falling crude oil prices, but Morgan Stanley has researched across industries to determine some less clear-cut winners and losers.
Airlines consume huge amounts of fuel, but the firm says American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) should benefit more than most from lower oil prices since they do not hedge the price of fuel to reduce price volatility.
Among autos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) draws concern because ""lower-for-longer oil certainly hurts the case for mass-market adoption of electric vehicles.���
Since lower gas prices should reduce shipping costs, Stanley sees the benefit trickling into Q1 per-unit shipping costs at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The firm likes Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) on the idea that Americans getting cheaper gas might be more ready to splurge on energy drinks, and gas stations and convenience stores account for 75% of MNST���s sales.
Among apparel companies and retailers, Stanley likes brands that are most popular with lower-income consumers, who they believe are most likely to put the money they save into new purchases: PLCE, FL, FINL, BWS, SKUL, ARO, BURL, ROST.

The WSJ and NYT have each run pieces asking whether a new tech bubble is afoot, at least in certain hot sectors. ""People are reaching for growth,"" says one fund manager quoted by the WSJ. Others argue the fact the high-flyers generally have substantial revenue, and are often profitable, makes the current situation different from the Dot.com bubble. Internet decliners: FB -3.4%.

I see no reason for long-term rates to head higher, says Jeff Gundlach, appearing on CNBC. He doesn't see the taper coming soon - incomes are falling, the labor force participation rate is stuck, and inflation is non-existent. Further, why would Janet Yellen take the Fed helm and immediately begin to reverse a policy she's so supportive of?
Without the taper, he notes, QE is actually expanding on a relative basis thanks to a smaller budget deficit and less Treasury issuance needing to be mopped up by the central bank.
The best opportunity in fixed income continues to be closed-end funds trading at discounts to net asset value��(his DBL being one of them). You can put together a basket of these, he says, yielding 8-9% and with a discount to NAV of 10%. Others possibilities (though we haven't checked their prices vs. NAV): PDI, PTY, PCI, PHK, PKO, PCN, PCI, PFN, PFL.

Elon Musk has published a 57-page document providing technical details, route proposals, and anything else readers might want to know about the Hyperloop, a solar-powered, aluminum pod-based, transportation system Musk asserts can safely send passengers from San Francisco to L.A. in 30 minutes.
In a BloombergBusinessWeek interview published in tandem with the document, Musk claims Hyperloop pods will be able to travel at 800 mph, and can carry cars as well as people. ""You just drive on, and the pod departs."" The magazine adds ""about a dozen people at Tesla and SpaceX have helped Musk with the design and checked the physics.""
Musk estimates a people-only L.A.-S.F. Hyperloop route can be built for just $6B, and a car-supporting route for only $10B. However, for 1,000+-mile distances, he thinks ""the tube cost starts to become prohibitive.""
As previously stated, Musk doesn't plan to build the Hyperloop himself (he's too busy with certain other ventures), but will open-source its design for third parties to make use of. Is it the future of transportation, or too good to be true?
Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is petitioning regulators to allow it to remove side mirrors from its cars in favor of cameras appearing on a display. Doing so could allow Tesla to lower aerodynamic drag by 3%-6%.
