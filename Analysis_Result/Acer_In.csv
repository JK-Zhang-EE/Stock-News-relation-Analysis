Thinly traded nano cap Opexa Therapeutics (OPXA +27.5%) is up on a whopping 120x surge in volume. Shares almost doubled since Monday before retracing as eager investors pile in apparently expecting positive results from the Phase 2b Abili-T trial assessing lead product candidate Tcelna (imilecleucel-T) for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, an FDA Fast Track designation. Last month, the company reported that 98% of all patient visits have been completed. The release of top-line data, however, is not expected until Q4.
Tcelna is a personalized T-cell immunotherapy that is specifically tailored to each patient's immune response profile to myelin, a white fatty substance that insulates nerve cells. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by damage to this insulation, called the myelin sheath.
Secondary progressive MS represents ~half of the total MS population. Patients have very limited treatment options.
