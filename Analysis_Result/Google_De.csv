But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary."" ""I don't know if there's been much hostility; I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated,"" Delrahim says. ""Over the last 30-40 years we've had a pretty strong and bipartisan consensus ... on the right balance for antitrust enforcement ... Are there areas, do we wish it would go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets.

""We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make profit, and then they evaporate after five years, 10 years, seven years,"" he says. ""And it makes no sense because seven years before, we're trying to guess where the market is.""

 Mobile apps are still leading the way among consumers' digital consumption, but they're tending to stick with ones they know and already have, according to a new comScore report. Some 57% of consumers' digital media time is taking place in mobile apps, according to comScore's 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps report, but a majority of consumers download zero apps per month. That 57% activity in mobile apps breaks down as 50% in smartphone apps and 7% in tablet apps. Meanwhile, desktop accounts for 34% of time and mobile Web 9%. Meanwhile, not only are younger users skewing the curve on mobile-apps time spent (those 18-24 are spending 3 hours a day in apps, vs. 2.6 hours for 25-34, and 2.3 hours for 35-44), they're the ones who are downloading new apps. Of those 18-34, 70% say they're always looking for new apps and they're willing to pay for them. Just over 50% of all users don't download new apps, and 66% of users buy zero paid apps per month.

Those vehicles weren't designed for sale, and Google said it wasn't sharing proprietary info with Fiat Chrysler, but FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne had suggested the deal could evolve into something stronger. There's no timetable for marketing the cars, Krafcik says, but: ""We have a responsibility to get this out there as soon as we can and really as soon as we have data that says we're better than the current system of flawed human drivers ...

Annual growth accelerated sharply from Q4's 50%, with Kenshoo citing the popularity of newer products such as Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads and Instagram ads.
Client ad impressions rose 14% Q/Q and 6% Y/Y, after seeing negative annual growth in Q4 (Facebook shows fewer ads on phones than PCs). Clicks rose 19% Q/Q and 54% Y/Y, aided by a 45% Y/Y increase in click-through rate (better ad targeting helps). Prices for ads sold on a CPC (cost per click) basis rose 20% Y/Y, and prices for ads shown on a CPM (cost per 1K impressions) basis 75%.
Notably, Instagram made up 17% of social ad clicks, and app install ads (could soon see competition from Apple) 25%. Kenshoo previously reported client social ad spend was up 87% Y/Y in Q1 through February.

The facilities will be a mixture of Google-built data centers and ones leased from third parties.
The openings will increase the number of cloud ""regions"" supported by Google by 5x to 15 - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) currently has 12, with plans to open another 5 - and are part of a major expansion push led by new cloud chief Diane Greene. Google's efforts also include upping its enterprise sales and marketing spend - both to gain IaaS/PaaS share, and to sell Microsoft Office clients on Google Apps.

Though Google's IaaS/PaaS services have won praise for their performance, pricing, and developer-friendly features, Amazon - in addition to having greater mindshare - is seen as having a more extensive feature set and (via the AWS Marketplace and AWS Partner Network) a much larger ecosystem. 451 Group analyst Carl Brooks thinks Google still needs to add more enterprise compatibility, compliance, and security features.

The WSJ reports the EU is moving closer toward filing charges against Alphabet/Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over the company's favoring of its own apps on Android. A recent EC information request to Google rivals suggests regulators are prepping a ""statement of objections"" to back up its charges.
Last April, the EU charged Google with favoring its own shopping service (Google Shopping) within searches. The Android probe could have larger consequences, since Google's required bundling of its own apps and services on phones/tablets using the company's version of Android is a core part of its mobile monetization strategy - it has both helped several Google products (Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Play) top 1B monthly active users, and kept the company's traffic acquisition costs down.
The WSJ's report comes shortly after a Russian court upheld an adverse fall ruling by local regulators over Google's Android bundling practices. To comply with the Russian ruling, which grants a win to search rival Yandex, Google has to amend its contracts with smartphone OEMs and pay a fine of up to 15% of its 2014 revenue from pre-loaded apps.

This makes the move to the cloud a no-brainer for us. Google, in our experience, has an edge here, but it?ï¿½s a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future.""

Spotify VP Nicholas Harteau says his firm has already moved 250K of its 20M user accounts onto Google's cloud, and will migrate its entire service to Google within 18 months.
Spotify never mentions AWS in its announcement. However, the company is listed on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) site as a client. Per Amazon, Spotify has used AWS' S3 storage service to store music tracks, and its CloudFront CDN service to deliver apps and software updates.

He sees op. margin growing 240 bps in 2016, fueled by AWS growth, lower Prime customer retargeting expenses, robotics investments, a mix shift towards third-party sales, and the leveraging of Amazon's Indian infrastructure.
He adds Piper's Amazon Search Index indicates the company saw 24%-26% Y/Y unit growth in Q4, and believes markets only expect 22%-24%.

The accounting move aims to make various parts of Alphabet/Google's empire more accountable for their spending, following years of major investments in high-risk/high-reward projects. The report comes four months after one noting new CFO Ruth Porat has begun ""an internal audit examining costs, revenue and accounting systems,"" and that new hiring restrictions are in place.
Soon after that, Google posted a Q2 EPS beat made possible in part by spending controls. Porat stated on the Q2 call Google plans to direct ~70% of its spending towards its core business, ~20% towards adjacent areas, and ~10% towards big new ideas.
A source tells the WSJ Alphabet hopes to eventually ""be a family of companies that offers efficient, centralized services to help entrepreneurs grow businesses faster.""

A weekend report from The Information may or may not be playing a role: The site states Autodesk CEO Carl Bass recently talked with Larry Page about becoming the head of Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) robotics unit. The talks are said to have fallen through ""for a mix of reasons,"" including the amount of control Bass would have over the unit.
Sources talking with The Information argue rejections such as Bass' point to an ""inherent weakness"" in Alphabet's structure: The company still isn't providing its non-Google operating units (they include Nest Labs, Calico, Google Ventures, Google Capital, and A.I. unit DeepMind) the kind of autonomy sought by many entrepreneurs.

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has bought Bebop Technologies, a stealth-mode startup that has been working on an enterprise cloud app development platform, and which was founded by VMware co-founder and Google board member Diane Greene.
Greene will now lead a new unit containing all of Google's cloud businesses, including Google Apps (productivity apps), Google for Work (custom versions of Google products for enterprises), and the Google Cloud Platform (cloud infrastructure and app platform services). CEO Sundar Pichai declares the move will ""bring together product, engineering, marketing and sales and allow us to operate in a much more integrated, coordinated fashion.""
Pichai provides some vague details regarding Bebop: ""[B]ebop is a new development platform that makes it easy to build and maintain enterprise applications ... bebop and its stellar team will help us provide integrated cloud products at every level: end-user platforms like Android and Chromebooks, infrastructure and services in Google Cloud Platform, developer frameworks for mobile and enterprise users, and end-user applications like Gmail and Docs.""
The move comes shortly after Google SVP Urs Hç¹¹lze proclaimed (in remarks that may or may not have been blessed by Google's brass) the company's Cloud Platform revenue could surpass its ad revenue in five years. With 90% of Google's Q3 revenue coming from ads (and much of the rest from hardware, Google Play, etc.), that could prove a tall order.
Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) fell 6.1% in regular trading, with Hç¹¹lze's remarks having been mentioned as a potential culprit. Stifel defended Rackspace, arguing the remarks were misunderstood and that Rackspace will eventually strike a deal to provide managed services for Google's cloud offerings, much as it has with Amazon and Microsoft.
Synergy Research estimates Google is the 4th-largest player in the in the broader market for public, private, and hybrid cloud services, trailing IBM, Microsoft, and 800-lb. gorilla Amazon. The company has tried to differentiate its cloud offerings by emphasizing developer needs; the Bebop acquisition fits with that effort.

Google: ""We?ï¿½ve spent a lot of time listening to what people using Google+ had to say. There were two features they kept coming back to: Communities, which now average 1.2 million new joins per day, and Collections, which launched just five months ago and is growing even faster ...

And it?ï¿½s more mobile-friendly?ï¿½we?ï¿½ve rebuilt it across web, Android and iOS so that you?ï¿½ll have a fast and consistent experience whether you are on a big screen or small one.""
Google is five months removed from no longer requiring users of YouTube and other services log in via Google+, and six months removed from moving cloud photo storage/sharing into a standalone Google Photos apps.

Chrome's business value to Google stems both from its ability to drive traffic to Google search via address bar and home page integration - Microsoft browsers and Apple's iOS/Mac OS Spotlight search feature have Bing as their default search engine, and Firefox has Yahoo in the U.S. - and from eliminating the traffic acquisition costs Google has to pay for default search deals for 3rd-party browsers such as Apple's Safari.

YouTube Red, the online video giant's anticipated subscription service, provides ad-free access to YouTube's video library (including music videos), as well as offline downloads. It also includes a subscription to the Google Play Music streaming/offline download service, and supports the newly-launched YouTube Gaming service. The service becomes available on Oct. 28 in the U.S., and will soon afterwards launch globally
Red's pricing is bound to draw attention - it's on par with what Spotify, Apple, and others charge for standalone music streaming services - and raises the question of whether Google (GOOG -0.7%) is choosing to absorb near-term losses on the service for the sake of subscriber growth. Google is giving content providers a 55% aggregate subscription revenue cut (on par with their standard ad revenue cut), and also has to pay music licensing fees.
YouTube has 1B+ monthly active users to cross-sell the service to. Over half the platform's video views now come from mobile devices, and the average mobile viewing session has grown to more than 40 minutes. 80% of views come from outside the U.S.
Re/code has reported YouTube plans to make some of the original content it has financed available only to subscribers. No word yet on whether YouTube will also begin providing licensed material from 3rd-party studios - a move that would put Red into more direct competition with the likes of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will provide Yahoo (YHOO) with Web and image search services, as well as search ads via its AdSense for Search (AFS) platform (allows a custom Google-powered search engine to be provided). The deal covers both PCs and mobile devices, and will apply to Yahoo proprieties and affiliate sites in the U.S., Canada, and various Asian, African, and Latin American markets (but apparently not Europe, where regulators have been closely probing Google). (8-K filing)
Google will ""pay Yahoo a percentage of the gross revenues from AFS ads displayed on Yahoo Properties or Affiliate Sites,"" with the exact figure varying based on geography and platform. Yahoo will pay fees for Web and image search results. Yahoo ""has discretion to select which search queries to send to Google and is not obligated to send any minimum number of search queries.""
The deal, which could raise some eyebrows among regulators given Google's search dominance, follows an April restructuring of Yahoo's search pact with Microsoft/Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT) that made the alliance non-exclusive on both PCs and mobile. The revised deal still requires 51% of Yahoo's PC search traffic to carry Bing results and ads.

comScore estimates Yahoo had a 12.7% September PC search share in the U.S. (still by far the world's biggest ad market). Google's share is pegged at 63.8%, and Microsoft's at 20.6%. StatCounter estimates Yahoo's U.S. mobile/tablet search share is at 6.8%, and Google's at 88.4%.
YHOO -0.6% after hours after disclosing the deal in tandem with a Q3 miss. GOOG is flat. There was already speculation a deal could happen, given Yahoo has been testing Google-powered results.

Notably, Re/code adds video industry sources have been told by Google it plans to charge just $10/month for the combined service - a price matching that charged by Spotify, Apple, and many others for standalone subscription music offerings.

Google (GOOG -1.4%), whose various ad platforms (AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, YouTube) are vulnerable to browser ad-blockers, is in the crosshairs. As are numerous online ad tech firms connecting publishers and sellers with each other and/or ad exchanges.
Softening the blow for Google: Browsing done via its Chrome browser or core app - both are popular on iOS - isn't affected, nor is the YouTube app. Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter, which get far more mobile traffic from their apps than their sites, might see only a modest hit. StatCounter estimates Safari had a 22.9% global mobile/tablet browser share in August, down from 31.2% a year ago and below a combined 46% for Chrome and the stock Android browser.
On the flip side, iOS accounts for a disproportionate % of mobile usage and online shopping among the higher-income users coveted by advertisers, and also within the U.S. (45% of Google's Q2 revenue). StatCounter pegs Safari's U.S. mobile/tablet share at 55.2%, and Chrome/stock Android's at 39.5%.
PC browser ad-blocking has already seen tremendous growth, especially in Europe. Defenders of the practice cite privacy concerns and the impact of ads on a device's performance/battery life, while critics argue publishers of free/ad-supported content are being deprived of their livelihoods.

Such a move would also be about going where the money happens to be flowing: Online video ads are rapidly taking share from traditional display ads, as more TV ad dollars move online.

The Supreme Court has ruled Oracle (ORCL -0.4%) can press claims Google (GOOG -1%) infringed its copyrights by using Java APIs within Android, turning down a request by Google to hear the case. The dispute will now return to a lower court.
Oracle has sought over $1B in damages. Though a district court jury cleared Google in 2012 of infringing 8 Oracle patents, it ruled Google infringed Oracle copyrights. A federal appeals court later declared Oracle's code is eligible for copyright protection, sending the case back to the district court. Google had appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.
Google, backed by Yahoo, Red Hat, and HP, has argued granting Oracle's code copyright protection will prevent developers from building on top of past software innovations. Oracle, backed by Microsoft, EMC, and NetApp, has accused Google of plagiarizing its code.

Unconfirmed Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) buyout chatter is propelling Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) higher. In the past, shares have also risen on rumors (later shot down) that Carl Icahn has taken a stake.

Speculation that Google could bid for the microblogging platform has been around for a while. Twitter's recent selloff, search/ad integration deals with Google, and Dick Costolo's resignation have fanned the flames.
With a current market cap of $23.7B - a buyout offer might need to be above $30B - Twitter would represent a big acquisition even by Google's standards.

YouTube Gaming provides a dedicated app and site for all of the online video giant's gaming content, whether livestreamed or previously uploaded. The service will launch this summer, beginning in the U.S. and U.K.
Over 25K games will have dedicated pages/channels sporting related video content. YouTube (GOOG -0.7%), which has over 1B monthly active users and now gets over half its video views from mobile, is looking to steal some of game livestreaming leader Twitch's thunder. Twitch was acquired by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year after reportedly holding buyout talks with Google; it had over 100M monthly viewers as of December, up from 45M a year earlier.
Separately, Google has been receiving a large amount of positive ink for Now on Tap (recently unveiled at Google I/O, ships with Android M), which lets users pull up info and content related to whatever appears on their screens (including content in 3rd-party apps) by pressing and holding the home button.
Backchannel's Steven Levy observes Now on Tap, which leverages Google's huge machine learning investments to analyze content, is effectively bringing search to apps, thereby helping address the threat posed by app usage to Google's search ad cash-cow. ""Liberated from the search box, Google wants to be your constant companion, ready with a search result whenever you ask and even when you don?ï¿½t.""
Now on Tap could also serve as a selling point for Android, given it requires a level of hardware and OS access that Apple has never provided for iOS devices. Apple unveiled its Proactive assistant/Google Now rival earlier this week at WWDC.

Google states 7 out of 10 Android devices currently support Pay, and that 700K U.S. stores are able to accept it. (live blog)

Android M, expected later this year, will be a nuts-and-bolts OS update rather than a major overhaul. Product chief Sundar Pichai: ""We've really focused on polish and quality, we've literally solved thousands of bugs."" New features include Android Pay, better app permission controls, deep linking between apps, and custom Chrome tabs within apps.

Brillo, the Android-based IoT OS rumored to be in the pipeline, will launch in Q3. The OS is promised to be very resource-efficient, and will be accompanied by a communications software stack called Weave that lets Brillo devices easily interact with each other (as well as phones).
Google's cloud photo service (previously buried within Google+) will now be provided through a standalone Photos app; it uses machine learning to organize pictures by people, places, and things. Notably, Google will be providing free, unlimited, cloud storage for photos and videos; photo resolution is limited to 16MP, and video to 1080p.
As Apple reportedly preps a Google Now rival, Google is launching Now on Tap, a feature that brings up Now cards related to whatever is on a user's screen by long-pressing the home button. Now will also handle voice searches that take into account the content a user is viewing.

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has moderated the pace of its cloud infrastructure (IaaS) price cuts over the last 12 months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't taking its foot off the pedal: Price cuts ranging from 5%-30% have been announced for its core Compute Engine computing virtual machine services.
Google claims it now has a 40% pricing edge over unnamed rival IaaS providers for many workloads - a 26% edge in list prices, plus a 14% benefit from ""customer-friendly"" pricing features such as sustained use discounting, per-minute billing, and a lack of prepaid service lock-in.
Also: Google has launched Preemptible VMs, a solution for running short-duration jobs on idle capacity at a 70% discount to regular prices (provided the capacity is available). The company suggests the option is useful for ""computationally expensive"" analytics and graphics-rendering workloads.
Google, which has tried to differentiate its cloud offerings by a focus on developer-friendly services - Amazon is still generally seen as having a lead in total features - also announced major price cuts last November. Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue rose 74% Y/Y in Q1, and that it was the market's 4th-biggest player after Amazon (towers over the space with a 29% share), Microsoft, and IBM.

""This summer, a few of the prototype vehicles we?ï¿½ve created will leave the test track and hit the familiar roads of Mountain View, Calif., with our safety drivers aboard,"" says Google (GOOG -1.3%). The announcement comes 5 months after Google, whose initial self-driving tests relied on modified 3rd-party cars, unveiled a fully functioning self-driving car prototype.
The prototypes will use the same software/algorithms as Google's fleet of modified Lexus RX450h SUVs, which have logged nearly a million miles of autonomous driving. For now, their speed will be capped at 25mph. Google is interested in ""uncovering challenges that are unique to a fully self-driving vehicle?ï¿½e.g., where it should stop if it can?ï¿½t stop at its exact destination due to construction or congestion.""
The Web giant has said it wants to begin selling a self-driving car by 2020, and has talked with various automakers about bringing one to market (with Google acting as a hardware/software supplier). Earlier this week, Google stated its cars have been involved in just 11 minor accidents during 1.7M miles of autonomous and manual driving over 6 years, and that ""not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.""

On a day that it posted a Q1 sales miss (a little ahead of schedule) and cut its full-year guidance, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announces it's partnering with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DoubleClick unit (a giant in the display ad space) to allow Twitter advertisers using DoubleClick to ""measure when conversions result from views and other actions on Twitter.""
Notably, Twitter/DoubleClick plan to give advertisers ""a new attribution model in DoubleClick to get a fuller understanding of how Twitter Ads served on mobile or desktop drive conversions for them across the web."" That could point to the (anonymous) use of Twitter profiles to track ad conversions. Also: The companies plan to make Twitter ad inventory available through DoubleClick Bid Manager, a widely-used ad-buying platform supporting many online ad exchanges.
The addition of Twitter as a partner is a notable win for DoubleClick as it tries to fend off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which last fall launched a new version of its Atlas ad server/measurement platform that tracks the performance of ads seen by Facebook users both on its site/apps and others. Facebook is counting on its anonymous linking of user profiles with ad measurement to give it an edge against DoubleClick and other rivals relying on cookies.
Meanwhile, Twitter's Q1 CC (live blog) failed to cheer up investors. The company mentioned Q2 user growth is off to a ""slow start,"" and that ad click rates (CTRs) declined Q/Q in Q1 due to a mix shift towards formats with lower CTRs. Ad load was flat, and app install ads (a format Facebook has seen huge success with) underperformed.
On the bright side, CEO Dick Costolo noted more than 1M people signed up for Twitter's Periscope live-streaming app in its first 10 days, that the company has seen ""orders of magnitude"" more native video on its site following the launch of a 30-second video platform in January, and that it's working with Apple on a Spotlight search integration deal. CFO Anthony Noto stated Twitter will begin counting users of its SMS follow service (there are currently ~6M) as MAUs.

Wireless service will be via Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) networks, switching between them depending on stronger signal.

Though Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are squaring off more than ever following yesterday's Facebook F8 conference product launches, none of it is intentional, insists Mark Zuckerberg in a Wired?interview.
Zuck: ""To the extent that we are doing measurement and Google did measurement, that?ï¿½s just because Google is smart and they also realize that measurement is valuable ... Same on the video front ... we are not thinking about how we are competing with YouTube. We are thinking about how are we going to make it more useful for people to share stuff on Facebook.""
Facebook's launch of a mobile ad exchange (competes against Google's DoubleClick, leverages Facebook data) and embedded video support (YouTube dominates video embeds) has led to more than a few headlines declaring Facebook is out to take Google's lunch. The companies already compete in multiple ad markets.
On the mobile ad exchange front, at least, the competitive overlap might be less than some think. As Foreester's Jim Nail observes, DoubleClick's exchange, much like Google search, focuses on intent-based advertising (i.e. ads for items users have recently expressed interest in), while Facebook's natural strength is targeting based on a user's historical likes.
Other Facebook F8 news: 1) Facebook has provided details about Aquila, a solar-powered drone that will have a wingspan similar to a Boeing 767, and be used lasers to beam Web access to underserved regions.

In tandem with the end of Explorer Edition sales, Google has put Nest Labs CEO/ex-iPod chief Tony Fadell in charge of Glass strategy. Former marketing exec Ivy Ross still directly oversees Glass, which has had its share of bad PR.

With Apple Watch set to ship next month, leading high-end Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer plans to launch a watch that runs on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear platform, and is powered by an Intel (INTC +0.1%) CPU.
The PR provides few details about the watch, but Reuters reports the product will be a version of Tag's bestselling Carrera line, and launch next autumn. With Carerra watches often priced above $2K, the deal will likely be more valuable to Intel as a reference win - the vast majority of early smartwatch launches have involved ARM-based CPUs - than as a revenue-generator.
Intel is going after the wearables market by pitching its Atom CPUs for relatively powerful devices, and its tiny Quark CPUs for less resource-hungry products where battery life is a priority. It has also launched Curie, a button-sized module containing a Quark CPU, flash memory, Bluetooth radio, and sensor hub. The company has a partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica, and has reportedly landed a design win for the next version of Google Glass.
Separately, IBM (IBM +0.2%) has announced the first OpenPower servers - servers running on IBM's Power CPUs (compete against Intel's Xeon line), but which can be made by 3rd-party OEMs and could sell for much less than IBM's Power-based servers historically have - will launch in Q2 and be sold by Taiwanese manufacturer Tyan. IBM plans to offer its own OpenPower servers later this year in partnership with Taiwan's Wistron; they'll be aimed at the high-performance computing (HPC) market.
Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, and Rackspace are among the companies that have given their support to OpenPower.

Google (GOOG -1.4%) has struck deals with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to have the Google Wallet payments app pre-installed on Android phones sold by the carriers, starting later this year. The Web giant is also ""acquiring some exciting technology and intellectual property"" from the carriers' Softcard payments JV, which never fully got off the ground.
TechCrunch reported of Google's interest in Softcard last month. Thus far, Wallet's adoption has been hurt by limited support from carriers - Sprint was the only major U.S. backer - and retailers, as well as consumer reluctance to embrace NFC-based payments. However, the launch of (NFC-based) Apple Pay, along with the broader rollout of NFC-capable terminals and chip-and-PIN payment systems (they make card swipes a little less convenient) is altering the landscape.
The deal comes a few days after top Android OEM Samsung announced it's buying LoopPay, creator of a mobile payments solution that works with standard card-swipe terminals.
Mobile payments plays include NFC reader maker On Track Innovations (OTIV -5.7%) and payment-processing/telemetry services provider USA Technologies (USAT -2.7%).

Among other things, Anmuth cites ""the transition from desktop to mobile search, continued margin compression, and increasing competition from Facebook.""
The indirect challenge posed by Facebook to Google's ad dollars was raised by some following Google's Q3 miss. Meanwhile, Facebook's Atlas (display ad-buying/measuring) and Audience Network (mobile ad network) platforms directly compete against Google's DoubleClick and AdMob units.
The ability of Google search to deliver ads directly tied to user intent (i.e. what a user is looking to buy at a particular moment) still acts as a key selling point when battling for ad dollars. Facebook's ad targeting, by contrast, is often driven by previously-obtained user data.

The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has ""approached retailers about creating a 'buy' button"" for Google Shopping that would work much like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) one-click ordering feature.
Google is also said to be ""considering a [Google Shopping] marketing program that would allow merchants to promote two-day shipping."" The program would be similar to one from ShopRunner that provides unlimited two-day shipping from various retailers for $79/year. Amazon Prime, of course, provides unlimited two-day shipping (among other things) for $99/year.
Sources caution several retailers approached by Google were cool to the ""Buy"" button concept, fearing more price competition and a loss of control over the shopper experience. Google could profit from the button either by charging a transaction fee, or by simply seeing higher conversions when it's used (thus raising ad prices). The company might also get better conversion data than it's currently receiving.
As ChannelAdvisor's data drives home, Google Shopping ads (deeply integrated with Google search) have been seeing rapid growth; Wal-Mart, Best Buy, eBay, and Sears are among their many buyers. Amazon, though spending plenty on standard Google search ads, is a high-profile holdout.

Pixalate says its analyzed 100B+ ad impressions, gauging metrics such as viewability, fraud rates, engagement, and domain masking (i.e. the disguising of the Web address an ad links to).
Google/DoubleClick, which has been gaining display ad share for a number of years, received a maximum network score (measures the quality of ad domains) of 99. It also got high marks for inventory quality (92), viewability (96), engagement (90), domain masking (96), and fraud (88).
Among publicly-traded online ad firms, The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI) was a standout, coming in at #3. Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) also fared well, ranking #15.
On the other hand, mobile ad network owner Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) was ranked #300. Millennial, bleeding mobile ad share to Google and Facebook (among others) over the last two years, is said to have a ""high ratio of fraudulent traffic.""

Glass was once expected to see an early-2014 commercial launch. For now, only a $1,500 Explorer Edition is available.
9 of the 16 Glass developers contacted by Reuters said had ""stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device.""

As expected, the service provides ad-free access to YouTube music videos, both for official and user-uploaded content. It also gives listeners (thanks to the bundling of Google's existing All Access music service) audio-only playback and offline storage support.
Music Key will be available for free in invite-only mode for six months. Afterwards, YouTube will initially offer a promotional lifetime price of $7.99/month, and subsequently charge $9.99/month, thus matching Spotify (12.5M paid users, 50M total) and many other rivals.
Apple is reportedly trying to get music labels to agree to fee cuts that would allow it to offer a revamped Beats Music streaming service at a lower price.
The inclusion of music video support, together with YouTube's giant reach - it has 1B+ active users - should make Music Key a tougher rival to Spotify than All Access. YouTube's offering might also be a precursor to an ad-free subscription option for the entire site.

Needham: ""While Paid Clicks slowed, particularly in mobile, we believe Google is well positioned for the transition to mobile ...? We also expect Google to benefit from its strengthening relationship with brands. Google's efforts to prove that its online advertising attribution drives offline conversions should translate into larger ad budget allocations.""

SunTrust: ""Google continues to dominate search share and be a leader in display, video, mobile, and software applications. The network effects created powerful product extensions to provide a prolonged period of growth.""
BofA is also staying bullish, but has cut its target by $70 to $600, and voices some concerns. ""While some of the slowdown in growth is due to tougher comps, results suggest a slowing environment for Online traffic and advertising, or a competitive shift to social sites.""

Likewise, sales chief Omid Kordestani (filling in for the departed Nikesh Arora) suggested the slowdown in paid click growth is a normal fluctuation, and that swings happen from time to time as changes are made. Is Facebook a culprit? The social networking giant's ad sales rose 67% Y/Y in Q2 to $2.68B.
Pichette attributes much of the 20% Y/Y increase in Google sites revenue to mobile search (not surprising), and the 9% increase in ad network revenue to Google's AdMob (mobile display ad) and Ad Exchange platforms.

In an in-depth column, The Atlantic reports Google has carried out over 30 test flights for its drone initiative, known as Project Wing, and hopes its drones can eventually be used by its same-day delivery service to deliver products within minutes.
Google, whose effort has been ongoing for 2 years, has opted for an unconventional aircraft design called a tail-sitter. It's described as ""a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around."" By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air delivery drones rely on 8 helicopter-like propellers.
Google's drones lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics"" at the end. The electronics detect when a package hits the ground, and then detach and are pulled back up.

The Atlantic doesn't shy away from the fact plenty of reliability and safety questions remain, as do nuts-and-bolts hardware issues such as improving battery life and reducing noise. Google is said to be ""in the very early days of developing a mature, reliable detect-and-avoid system.""
Wing is headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy. Over the last 12 months, Google has bought leading military robot maker Boston Dynamics, solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace (meant to further Google's Web connectivity and imagery efforts), A.I. tech developer DeepMind, and hardware engineering/design firm Gecko Design.

The Information reports Amazon (AMZN +1%) ""has been in late-stage talks"" to acquire popular game-broadcasting platform Twitch, and could announce a deal shortly. Prior reports stated Google (GOOG -0.4%) was close to a deal to buy Twitch for ~$1B, or had fully reached one.
Twitch, whose platform allows users to live-stream their gaming activity (along with running commentary), has 50M+ users and a network of 4K+ content provider partners. The startup claims its average user watches 95 minutes/day of content.
Buying Twitch would represent a major investment by Amazon in free (ad-supported) online video. Thus far, the bulk of the company's Web video investments have been directed towards Prime Instant Video. Amazon has also been fleshing out its own game studio.
The Information's report shortly follows a WSJ report stating Amazon is working on a keyword-based ad platform (called Sponsored Links) that aims to replace ads based on Google's bread-and-butter AdWords keyword platform on Amazon's site and elsewhere. Amazon has already built up a sizable ad business, aided by its volumes of customer data.

At the same time, IDC notes over 80% of iPhone shipments ($561 Q2 ASP) involved a $400+ unsubsidized price, with the remainder in the $200-$400 range. Nearly 60% of Android shipments involved sub-$200 phones, with the remainder split almost evenly between $200-$400 and $400+ devices.

VentureBeat reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reached a deal to buy live game-broadcast/streaming leader Twitch for ~$1B.

Variety and The Verge reported in May Google, via YouTube, was in talks to acquire Twitch for $1B. The site claims 50M+ monthly users, including over 1.1M who broadcast their gaming activity, and has 4K+ content provider partners (inc. major sites such as GameSpot and Joystiq) whom it typically shares ad revenue with.
Twitch has thus far successfully fended off a competitive challenge from YouTube, which reportedly had $1.5B in 2013 net revenue and is now run by former Google ad/commerce product chief Susan Wojcicki. Twitch's heavy reliance on the coveted 18-34 demographic hasn't gone unnoticed.

Apple (AAPL +8.4%), Google (GOOG -0.4%), Intel (INTC - unchanged), and Adobe (ADBE -1.9%) have settled an antitrust suit accusing them of creating illegal no-hire agreements.
Terms are undisclosed for now. 64K employees had been collectively seeking $3B in damages, and antitrust rules could in theory triple that figure in the absence of a settlement.
The settlement comes after PandoDaily unearthed a slew of e-mails from Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, and others pointing to the existence of no-hire deals.
Separately, Google has denied media reports stating Glass is now publicly available. The company says it failed to edit an order page created for Glass' April 15 sale (thus giving the impression it's still available), and will be pulling the page shortly.

513,2014-04-21,-7.48,"WSJ: Square mulling sale, Google discussed an acquisition","


The WSJ reports mobile payments upstart Square, reported two months ago to have indefinitely postponed its IPO, has ""discussed a possible sale to several deeper-pocketed rivals.""
The paper adds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) discussed buying Square this year, though it's not clear if talks are continuing. Apple and PayPal are said to have held informal talks that never progressed.

Re/code and The Information previously reported Google has shown interest in Square, which processed over $20B worth of transactions last year (largely through its mobile card readers and related apps) and could provide Google with valuable data on offline purchase activity and ad effectiveness (previous). Google's own mobile/offline payments efforts haven't lived up to expectations.
The WSJ's sources state Square had 2013 revenue of $550M, but only with a gross margin of 21% (down from 2012's 27%) after backing out processor payments and other fees. That led net loss to total ~$100M.
Square has been hatching plans to up-sell merchants on value-added software and services, but it remains very dependent on transactions for now. The company has been valued at $5B in private share sales, but public investors might now assign a lower valuation.

514,2014-04-11,-10.35,Report: Google looking to use offline data to grow ad sales,"


The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has launched a pilot program that fuses data about a user's AdWords search ad clicks with offline purchase data from the likes of Acxiom (NYSE:ACXM) and DataLogix - those two firms are already partnering with  Facebook and Twitter.
Google's reported goal: To provide advertisers with better data about the extent online activity drives offline purchases, and in doing so motivate them to ramp their AdWords spend.
Benny Arbel, CEO of ad tech startup myThings: ""If Google can demonstrate that people did not just click on an ad but that they actually bought something, that is the Holy Grail.""
Google's effort could prove particularly helpful on mobile, where its ad prices remain relatively soft (moreso for smartphones than tablets) and users are often less likely to follow up on an ad click with an online purchase.
A recent comScore-backed survey found 78% of U.S. mobile searches for local information led to offline purchases. Moreover, comScore states ""nearly half of all service, restaurant and travel searchers were looking for a business they have never made a purchase from before.""
In addition to Google, those figures could have positive implications for YELP.
