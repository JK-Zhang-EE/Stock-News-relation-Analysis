The report says current and former fact-checkers say their collaboration with Facebook has produced minimal results and that they've lost trust in the company.

""Contrary to a claim in the story, we absolutely do not ask fact-checkers to prioritize debunking content about our advertisers,"" the company says, arguing that instead potential fake news is surfaced via machine learning. In response to another claim in the story -- that Facebook has repeatedly refused to release meaningful data about the impact of the fact-checking effort -- the company says it's heard feedback and ""we’re starting to send fact-checkers quarterly reports that include customized statistics that reflect the work and impact of each fact-checker.""

BuzzFeed News reports that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg requested research on company critic George Soros, contrary to Sandberg's prior claim that she was unaware of the work done by opposition research firm Definers.
Facebook acknowledged its ties to Definers after a New York Times report but said Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had little to no knowledge of the firm's work.
A FB spokesperson now admits that Sandberg did request research on Soros but says she did not direct Definers.
Key quote from the statement: ""Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook. That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock. Sheryl never directed research on Freedom from Facebook. But as she said before she takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch.""

The government was reportedly pressing for an encryption break in the summer, around a gang investigation. That attempt failed, Reuters reported.

That's part of a larger report offering new dents to the reputation of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Eight current and former employees from Sandberg's side of the organization blame her for company problems due to missteps including prioritizing her brand over the company's, filtering out bad news, and slow-playing serious problems. Scrutiny over the past couple of years has centered on CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but after a scathing NYT report, ""she is always going to be tainted,"" one employee source told Bloomberg. On the War Room, Facebook says it was never intended to be permanent and suggests its strategic response team is a more permanent solution to addressing crisis problems. (h/t CNBC)

That effectively provides cover for denials about the firm from CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg in the wake of a scathing NYT piece on Facebook leadership. And Sandberg has commented on the memo as well. The Republican-backing opposition research firm (mentioned in the NYT piece) was originally tapped by Facebook to monitor press coverage of the company before expanding its work to include going aggressively after competitors. That included promoting conspiracy theories tying Facebook criticism to Democratic donor George Soros, who had called the company a ""menace to society.""

""Responsibility for these decisions rests with leadership of the Communications team,"" he goes on. ""That’s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy."" He justifies the use of opposition research to tackle Facebook's opponents. But Facebook didn't ask Definers to distribute or create fake news, he says. Sandberg added comment at the bottom: ""I want to be clear that I oversee our Comms team and take full responsibility for their work and the PR firms who work with us.

With Facebook becoming a powerful force in daily life around the globe, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg ""stumbled."" ""Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view,"" says the piece, in which more than 50 people were interviewed. ""At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives."" Facebook responds by acknowledging that it has been slow to address challenges, but has made progress; in the meantime, lawmakers and the Trump administration have been working up proposals for a national privacy law, which would set off a lengthy battle over the future of Facebook's central business model. Troubles in the executive ranks were apparent in late 2015 when then-candidate Donald Trump used the platform for a call to shut down Muslim immigration, and they accelerated with news in 2016 that Russian hackers seemed to be probing Facebook accounts to find people connected to the presidential campaigns.

And 53% said Facebook was making the world better, vs. 72% the prior year. While the workforce has been resilient in past challenges, this time may be different because declines in the stock price may be playing a bigger part in morale due to stock-option compensation.

But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary."" ""I don't know if there's been much hostility; I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated,"" Delrahim says. ""Over the last 30-40 years we've had a pretty strong and bipartisan consensus ... on the right balance for antitrust enforcement ... Are there areas, do we wish it would go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets. We're not picking winners and losers, we are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure the markets are free, for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones."" And as for the president's tweets about antitrust matters, including weighing in on the ACA's pressure on Comcast (CMCSA -0.2%), Delrahim notes the consent decree tied to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal expired but it's his job to make sure markets work nonetheless -- and he reiterated his opposition to behavioral remedies to cure antitrust concerns. ""We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make profit, and then they evaporate after five years, 10 years, seven years,"" he says. ""And it makes no sense because seven years before, we're trying to guess where the market is."" ""I believe in structural solutions,"" he adds, saying that's why DOJ was opposed to parts of the AT&T/Time Warner merger ""and that was the solution we provided.""

 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has pulled its Onavo data security app from Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store after the iPhone maker ruled that the service violated its data collection policies, WSJ reports. The app, which has been available as a free download through Apple’s app store for years, allows users to create a virtual private network that redirects internet traffic to a private server managed by Facebook and alerts users when they visit potentially malicious sites. Apple informed Facebook earlier this month that Onavo violated new rules designed to limit data collection by app developers as well as part of an agreement that prevents apps from using data in ways that go beyond what is directly relevant to the app or to provide advertising, according to the report.

 It should be Snap's (SNAP -0.1%) and CEO Evan Spiegel's moment, Bloomberg BusinessWeek notes today -- but with rivals copying its popular disappearing-stories approach, it's facing continuing usage challenges. ""Investors have come to see Snap as a smaller, unprofitable Facebook (FB +0.7%) rather than a new idea that should be judged on its own merits,"" Sarah Frier writes, though Spiegel blames part of that on miscommunication. Facebook's in the midst of privacy-related flak, and Twitter (TWTR +0.5%) and YouTube (GOOG +0.5%, GOOGL +0.3%) are wrestling with bots and bad users, but Snap is having trouble gaining traction. Spiegel has drawn criticism for a ""dictatorial management style and penchant for secrecy,"" but has worked toward self-improvement in his approach and in breaking down management silos at the company. Aside from his shyness, Spiegel is dinged for an aversion to criticism (""No exec challenges Evan,"" a former employee says) and a tendency to ignore warnings when he's challenged. Some investors hope for another seasoned leader to come aboard a la Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Frier writes, but their opinions might not matter much with Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy holding all the voting power.

 A more detailed look at Facebook (FB +0.3%) ad spending shows that despite slowdowns in core advertising that showed up in disappointing earnings guidance, ad spend is shifting to Instagram. Aside from healthy user growth, Merkle notes ad spend on Instagram is growing at four times the rate of core Facebook, and 4C sees even higher rates among its clients (up 204% Y/Y). The only rival there, 4C says, is LinkedIn (MSFT +0.5%), which saw 212% growth. Instagram's commitment to building its ad platform is paying off, says AdStage's Paul Wicker: ""Facebook recently announced that there are more than one billion Instagram users, and advertisers are drooling over all that inventory. Based on what we’re hearing from our customers and seeing in the data, we expect Instagram inventory to continue to grow through the rest of 2018.""

""Smart-money"" advice for Zuckerberg from the investing world is coalescing around this point: Stick to comments on new privacy tools and apologies, and stay out of the weeds on Facebook's business model -- which many argue is entirely about bundling and selling off the private data of its users. 2:13 p.m.: Shortly before a delayed start to Zuckerberg's testimony, on a day where the S&P 500 is up 1.9%, Facebook shares are up 2.7%.

Shares are now up 3.4%; Nasdaq is up 2% as a whole. 3:07 p.m.: Sen. Nelson takes Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's hint that the company could charge users who don't want to see targeted ads, and presents it to Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg says people can turn off third-party information today. ""I think what Sheryl was saying was, in order to not run ads at all, we'd need some kind of business model."" Does that mean the user information is Facebook's property? ""No, Senator. The first line of our terms of service"" says the user owns the information. 3:12 p.m.: Cambridge Analytica has begun what could be a lengthy tweetstorm as the hearing progresses. 3:23 p.m.: ""There will always be a version of Facebook that is free,"" Zuckerberg tells Sen.

Maria Cantwell asks whether Silicon Valley firm Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica how to use the data for political campaigns, and gets specific about the Trump campaign. ""Senator, I'm not aware of that."" 3:39 p.m.: Sen. Pat Leahy steers it to Special Counsel Robert Mueller and whether that probe has hit Facebook. ""I'm not aware of a subpoena,"" Zuckerberg says after cautioning about revealing confidential info. ""There may be, but I know we're working with them."" He's not been interviewed himself, he says. Shares are now up 4.2%. 3:46 p.m.: Pressed repeatedly by Sen. Lindsey Graham on who the company's biggest competitor is, an evasive Zuckerberg tries to qualify that there's not just one. Is Twitter (TWTR +6%) the same?  ""It overlaps."" Do you think you have a monopoly? ""It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,"" Zuckerberg replies pointedly. 3:58 p.m: Sen. Roy Blunt touches a hot topic: Does Facebook do cross-device tracking and track offline data? ""I want to be sure we get this right,"" Zuckerberg says, saying he wants his team to follow up afterward. Pressed again (""It seems pretty simple""), he says ""I'm not sure of the answer to that question."" ... ""In general, Facebook is not collecting data from the other apps that you use."" 4:21 p.m.: Sen.

 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was made aware that the app at the center of the Cambridge Analytica data leak could sell its data to third parties, in violation of its own platform policies, the Financial Times reports. The company was sent terms and conditions for a second version of the personality-survey app that discussed the potential data transfers, but Facebook was using an automated process to accept updates -- raising the possibility that no employee saw the app's new policies. That second version departed starkly from an earlier version that said “users will be informed that the data will be carefully protected and never used for commercial purposes."" “There were a lot of apps at the time that were pulling lots of data — including from friend networks — and Facebook wasn’t exactly proactive in asking questions or finding out where that data went,” said Christopehr Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower.

 Building on its earlier announcement on an overhaul of privacy settings, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) says it will wind down Partner Categories, meaning it will stop using third-party data providers to offer ad targeting directly on the platform. Facebook has used data from aggregators like Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY) and Acxiom (NYSE:ACXM) to supplement its own data set, meaning advertisers could draw on a rich pool of their own data, Facebook's data and that of third parties to reach targets with extremely high accuracy. But in a new risky environment after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, Facebook is cutting off its relationship with datasets that are difficult to control. The decision wouldn't have had an impact on the outcome of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And Facebook will still use those third parties to help with ad measurement though Recode reports the company is re-evaluating that practice as well.

A jury had ruled that Oculus stole computer code from ZeniMax Media.               ZeniMax requested a court order to block some Oculus Rift models after winning the $500M intellectual property verdict in February.                   Facebook argues the sales ban would prove an unfair burden for Oculus down to the customers and wants to reduce the damage amount from the previous trial.                   Historically, judges tend to settle such matters with money rather than a product pull.                   The $600 Oculus Rift headset belongs to the tethered segment of the VR headset market, which sells fewer models than the untethered models due to the higher cost of entry and VR’s slow adoption rate by the general population.

That's heading into a ""golden era"" for mobile and Facebook in the catbird seat there, according to analyst Ross Sandler. He has a $154 price target, implying 8% upside from today. While Facebook runs the risk of finding out what predecessors have -- the moat around its users isn't as big as investors think -- the newsfeed is going to set up a long runway for growth at core Facebook and Instagram, Sandler says. “Messenger & WhatsApp are the “second act” in mobile monetization for FB, and we see $11B in incremental revenue by 2020.” He's got rival Snap (SNAP -1%) at Equal Weight, where it's facing good long-term prospects but growing pains in the short term (as with all tech IPOs) and little valuation support in a challenging scenario. His $24 price target is about 9% above today's $21.99 price. Meanwhile, Jefferies is still a bullish Buy on Snap, saying that Facebook's playing catch-up with its copycat camera effects. Facebook has added those effects and 24-hour ""disappearing"" stories, long associated with Snapchat, to its central offering in the latest move to cannibalize Snap's differentiators.

As it is, FBX has only functioned on Facebook's PC site - mobile accounted for 82% of Q1 ad revenue - and didn't support video ads. Other PC ad options, such as news feed ads recommending a user like/follow a page or shop at the advertiser's site (they can be purchased directly from Facebook), remain in place.
Facebook has been pruning its ad offerings in order to focus on high-quality formats that deliver a strong ROI. In March, the company ended a test for an automated ad-buying platform after seeing ""many bad ads and fraud."" More recently, it laid off ~40 workers within its LiveRail video ad unit (serves third-party publishers), and stopped doing business with LiveRail publishers that didn't meet Facebook's quality standards.

Gaming site Kotaku reports Microsoft (MSFT +1.5%) plans to launch ""a cheaper, smaller, Xbox One"" this year, and will launch a more powerful model in 2017. The cheaper/smaller Xbox is expected to be shown off at the industry's E3 conference (runs from June 14-16).
The 2017 console, codenamed Scorpio, will have a more powerful GPU, and be capable of handling 4K gaming and directly supporting Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift VR headset. Microsoft already has a partnership with Oculus through which streamed Xbox One games can be played on Rift headsets connected to Windows 10 PCs.
Also reported: 1) Microsoft wants to further its efforts to converge Xbox and Windows, with future hit games released on both platforms. 2) Microsoft is moving towards an ""incremental"" upgrade model for consoles (much as it's doing for Windows), with frequent hardware upgrades replacing massive upgrades that arrive every several years.
Sony has been widely reported to be prepping a revamped PlayStation 4 that supports 4K gaming and ""enhanced"" support for the company's PlayStation VR headset. Both the new console and the PlayStation VR are expected later this year.

Client ad impressions rose 14% Q/Q and 6% Y/Y, after seeing negative annual growth in Q4 (Facebook shows fewer ads on phones than PCs). Clicks rose 19% Q/Q and 54% Y/Y, aided by a 45% Y/Y increase in click-through rate (better ad targeting helps). Prices for ads sold on a CPC (cost per click) basis rose 20% Y/Y, and prices for ads shown on a CPM (cost per 1K impressions) basis 75%.
Notably, Instagram made up 17% of social ad clicks, and app install ads (could soon see competition from Apple) 25%. Kenshoo previously reported client social ad spend was up 87% Y/Y in Q1 through February.
Figures for client search ad spend (dominated by Google) were solid, though not spectacular. Ad spend fell 6% Q/Q (seasonality) and rose 13% Y/Y.

As expected, Facebook (FB +1.7%) has used its F8 conference to launch a developer platform for creating automated Messenger chatbots that (with the help of A.I. and natural-language processing) can conduct transactions and provide information.
Mark Zuckerberg argues the platform eliminates the need to download apps for many activities, as well as call businesses to place orders. ""I’ve never met anyone who likes calling a business,"" he quips. Two examples given: Buying flowers from 1-800 Flowers and having stories delivered by a CNN bot.
Facebook has already partnered with Uber and Lyft to enable ride requests via Messenger. Competition for Facebook's bot platform is provided by Microsoft (via its Bot Framework) and Amazon (via its Alexa voice assistant platform, which has been opened up to developers).
Zuck also announced Facebook is creating an API for its Live streaming platform (received a big revamp last week) that will allow any connected device to record and transmit Live streams. A DJI (DJI) drone streaming live video flew over the stage as Zuck talked.
Also disclosed: Facebook, which just launched the first commercial Oculus Rift VR headset, wants to provide an integrated VR and augmented reality (AR) headset in 10 years that doesn't look much different from a standard pair of glasses. Zuck: ""Augmented reality gives you the ability to see the world, but also deliver overlays on top of the real world."" Echoes of Google Glass.

Citing sources at both companies, The Information reports Yahoo (YHOO +2%) is thinking of letting Facebook (FB +0.4%) sell ads within Tumblr's popular mobile app, with the companies splitting the revenue that's produced.
Though Tumblr reported having 550M monthly visitors as of last year (only some of them have set up Tumblr accounts, the rest are just browsing its content), the blogging platform failed to hit Yahoo's $100M 2015 revenue target, leading Yahoo to take a $230M write-down on its $1.1B 2013 purchase of Tumblr. The Information reports only 10%-15% of Tumblr's ad inventory is being sold.
A Tumblr deal would involve Facebook's Audience Network, one of the top players in the mobile ad network space (others include Google's AdMob and Apple's iAd). Facebook previously disclosed the Audience Network was on a $1B/year revenue run rate (includes publisher payments) as of Q4. Yahoo has its own mobile ad network thanks to the Flurry acquisition, but Facebook's is reportedly ~3x larger, with Facebook getting a $200M cut on 2015 ad spend of $675M. Facebook argues its superior user data acts as a differentiator.

Through February, clients of Facebook (FB +0.5%) ad partner Kenshoo had increased their social media ad spend by 87% Y/Y, up from Q4's 50%, reports Baird's Colin Sebastian (Outperform rating, $120 target). Sebastian adds strong demand for Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads - they allow multiple products from an advertiser's catalog to be promoted - is contributing to the growth,, as is growing Instagram monetization.

Kenshoo estimates Dynamic Product Ads now make up 8%-9% of total social media ad clicks. Video ad clicks account for an estimated ~20% of Facebook's total (the same as Q4), and app install ads - a market for which Google (GOOG, GOOGL) just unveiled new offerings tied to mobile search - 10% of Facebook ad spend. Both search and social ad spend are deemed healthy as online ads continue taking share from offline channels, with search still accounting for ~3x as much spending as social.
Not surprisingly, Sebastian believes Facebook (has a long history of posting sales/earnings beats) can top Q1 estimates. Kenshoo also provided strong numbers in January ahead of Facebook's Q4 report - the company wound up trouncing estimates on the back of 57% Y/Y ad sales growth, up from Q3's 45% and Q2's 43%.

However, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus unit is widely seen as having a hardware technology lead in the nascent market, and has won the support of numerous developers. Oculus announced last week the first consumer Rift VR headset (requires a PC with a powerful GPU) will sell for $599 and begin shipping in late March.
Separately, Google has announced its annual I/O developer's conference (typically features a slew of product announcements) will be held this year from May 18-20 in Mountain View, CA.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is testing the use of multiple, topic-based, news feeds in its core mobile app. The traditional news feed still exists within the test, but it's complemented by secondary feeds with titles such as Style, Travel, and Headlines.
The secondary feeds make it easier for users whose standard feeds are swamped with content from hundreds of ""friends"" and Pages to follow specific types of material. A Facebook spokesperson: ""People have told us they'd like new options to see and have conversations about more stories on Facebook around specific topics they're interested in. So we are testing feeds for people to view different stories from people and Pages based on topic areas.""
Separately, Facebook is testing a more ambitious deployment of its shopping marketplace, which provides a personalized list of products being sold on Facebook pages (possibly with the help of Buy buttons), along with a search option. Though in testing since October, the feature was until recently buried within Facebook's app. Now, users seeing the test have a Marketplace icon placed on the bottom menu bar, to go with News Feed, Requests, and Notifications icons.
The topic-based news feeds could lend themselves well to ads fitting with specific content types (e.g. travel ads within the Travel feed). Meanwhile, e-commerce ads are a natural fit for the marketplace.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has updated Messenger to allow users to hail UBER rides without leaving the app. The service is initially launching in the U.S, and will later arrive elsewhere. Uber will pay for a user's first Messenger-enabled ride, up to $20.
More ride-hailing services (LYFT?) will be added in the coming months. Messenger claims 700M+ monthly active users, and has been rapidly expanding its reach. 3rd-party app support and a P2P money transfer service were launched in March, and a part-human, part-A.I. assistant service called M (built into Messenger) has been in testing since this summer.
Rival messaging platforms such as WeChat, Line, and Kik are already aggressively monetized via value-added services. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested he's uninterested in monetizing Messenger until it hits 1B users. WhatsApp, meanwhile, has topped 900M MAUs while maintaining a no-frills philosophy.

Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently-launched Tesla M40 GPUs have been designed into Big Sur, a computing platform created by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) specifically for A.I./machine learning tasks, and which has been open-source for use/improvement by third parties.
Big Sur contains eight GPU boards, but consumes just ~300W of power. Nvidia says it worked with Facebook to optimize Big Sur for delivering ""maximum performance for machine learning workloads, including the training of large neural networks across multiple Tesla GPUs."" Wired observes Facebook and others have found neural networks, which are modeled after the behavior of human neurons and improve their decision-making by taking in more data, are much more efficient when relying heavily on GPUs.
Facebook, like Google, has been investing heavily in machine learning for some time. Use cases include translating content, detecting faces within Facebook photos/videos, and improving the company's news feed algorithm by analyzing text. Machine learning is also being used by Facebook's M assistant (still in test mode).
The Facebook news comes a month after Nvidia unveiled the Jetson TX1, a module for drones/autonomous cars that runs on a Tegra processor and is declared to be ""the first embedded computer designed to process deep neural networks."" The company's Tesla GPUs are widely used in supercomputer/HPC deployments.

Echoing arguments familiar to many sell-side firms, Bonner cites Facebook's high mobile adoption rates, mobile ad monetization, and the potential of Messenger and Oculus.

Marcus: ""eBay takes a cut of every transaction and listing; Alibaba does all that for free, and makes money from advertising.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is testing (with select users) a feed within its mobile app that shows a list (personalized based on connections, likes, and interests) of products highlighted by businesses on their Facebook pages.
For now, Facebook isn't going out of its way to highlight the feed: To access it, users first need to click on Facebook's navigation menu tab, and then select Shopping from the Favorites category.  The move follows the launch of Buy buttons that allow users to make purchases without leaving Facebook, and the creation of mobile storefronts (via Shop and Services sections) for Pages that let users browse a business' products/services.
E-commerce software/services provider Shopify (SHOP -8.7%) has tumbled following Facebook's announcement. The selloff comes in spite of the fact Shopify has partnered with Facebook to help clients adopt Facebook's Buy button and mobile storefronts.
Facebook has been uninterested in taking a cut on transactions enabled by its various e-commerce tools. Rather, the company aims to give retailers more incentive to buy Facebook ads, and to drive higher ad prices by boosting conversion rates.

Starting in October, Facebook's (FB +0.1%) Like and Share buttons, nearly ubiquitous on the Web, will be used to send browsing data to Facebook that can be used to deliver targeted ads via its core service, Instagram, and mobile app ad network (i.e. the Facebook Audience Network).
Notably, a user doesn't have to click on a like or share button for data to be sent; simply visiting a page containing them is enough. Facebook is looking to address privacy concerns by letting users opt out of seeing ads based on non-Facebook activity.
Facebook already has plenty of experience with cross-site and cross-app ad targeting. E-commerce ads based on browsing activity are a staple on Facebook's news feed and (website) right-hand column, and the Audience Netowrk leverages Facebook activity data to send targeted ads to 3rd-party apps. Meanwhile, the company's Atlas ad-measurement/serving platform uses Facebook profiles (instead of cookies, which don't work as well on mobile) to anonymously track the performance of ads on and off Facebook, and across multiple devices.

M, launched today in test mode with a few hundred Bay Area users, operates within Facebook Messenger (FB +3.5%). Messenger chief David Marcus states M doesn't merely pull up information, but also completes tasks such as purchasing items, booking restaurants, and creating appointments.
Facebook is also looking to differentiate M from the likes of Siri, Google Now, and Cortana by relying on both A.I./machine learning and supervision from a group of Facebook employees called M trainers. A user sends a note to M by tapping a button within the Messenger app, and then receives follow-up questions and status updates on where a task stands.
Marcus, who once ran PayPal: ""We start capturing all of your intent for the things you want to do. Intent often leads to buying something, or to a transaction, and that’s an opportunity for us to [make money] over time ... An engineer went to Paris for a couple days, and his friend asked M to redecorate his desk in a French style. Twenty-four hours later, the desk was decorated with a proper napkin, baguette bread, and a beret."" Handling tedious customer service calls are another use case.
One lingering question, of course, is how well human supervision will scale if M is used by millions of Messenger users rather than just a few hundred, and if Facebook (via collected data and machine learning) can automate many of the tasks currently handled by people. Regardless, Marcus states Facebook plans to eventually employ thousands of M trainers.

comScore's April data indicates Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) core services accounted for 24% of all U.S. smartphone activity (on a minutes basis), reports JPMorgan's Dough Anmuth (Overweight rating, $100 target). That's up from March's 22% and well above the 5% collectively recorded by all other social networking services (Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, etc.).
Anmuth, a long-time Facebook bull, also reports Facebook's combined U.S. PC/mobile minutes share rose to 19% from March's 18%, and that minutes for its various platforms rose a combined 42% Y/Y, an acceleration from March's 35%.
He adds anecdotal checks indicate Facebook's autoplay video ads ""began to ramp more materially in late 1Q and into 2Q,"" and is upbeat about Facebook's efforts to boost engagement with new services such as Messenger video calling and its just-launched Instant Articles (previous).
The note comes amid largely positive early reactions to Instant Articles, which are initially supported by 9 publishers and (in addition to loading content much faster) support features such as autoplay video, interactive maps, audio captions, and high-res photo zooming. Facebook, looking to win over publishers nervous about losing site/app traffic, is letting partners keep 100% of the ad revenue produced by their articles, and giving them a 70% cut on unsold inventory monetized through Facebook's mobile ad network.

A month after launching a platform for integrating 3rd-party apps with Messenger, Facebook (FB +0.8%) is updating its iOS/Android Messenger apps to support video calling over mobile and Wi-Fi connections. The U.S. and 17 other markets are initially covered; more will be added later.Facebook's PC Messenger client (built into Facebook's site) has supported video calls since 2011, following a deal with Skype; Facebook later built its own video call infrastructure. Today's update makes the feature available to the 600M+ monthly active users of Messenger's mobile apps.One current shortcoming: Messenger app users can't place video calls to PC Facebook users. An exec says Facebook will soon fix the issue, and also plans to add group chat and video stabilization support. The long list of mobile apps/platforms currently supporting video calls includes Skype, Apple's FaceTime, Google's Hangouts, Tango, imo, WeChat, Line, and Viber.Both voice and video serve as natural extensions of Messenger's core chat features. Mark Zuckerberg stated in March Messenger now accounts for 10% of global VoIP phone calls. WhatsApp, which recently added VoIP call support to its mobile apps, doesn't yet support video calls.

392,2015-04-22,1.01,Facebook's Q1 ad sales hurt by strong dollar; MAUs up to 1.44B,"

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) ad revenue rose 46% Y/Y in Q1 to $3.54B, a slight slowdown from Q4's 53% growth. However, ad growth would've been at 55% in Q1 (and  58% in Q4) if not for a strong dollar. With  many already expecting heavy forex pressures, the Street hasn't reacted too harshly thus far to Facebook's Q1 sales miss.
Payments/other fees revenue, hurt by the shift from PC to mobile gaming, fell 5% to $226M after rising 7% in Q4. Mobile was 73% of ad revenue vs. 69% in Q4 and 66% in Q3.
Monthly active users (MAUs) rose 4% Q/Q and 13% Y/Y to 1.44B. Mobile MAUs rose 5% Q/Q and 24% Y/Y to 1.25B. Daily active users (936M) equaled 65% of MAUs, up slightly from Q4's 64%. Mobile-only MAUs (581M) are now 40% of total MAUs.
Facebook is making good on its promise to spend aggressively: Costs/expenses (non-GAAP) rose 57% Y/Y to $1.7B, eclipsing revenue growth of 42%. On a GAAP basis, R&D spend was 30% of revenue vs. 18% a year ago, thanks in part to stock compensation spend rising to 16% from 8%; sales/marketing spend was 17% vs. 13%, and G&A 8% vs. 7%. Cost of revenue was flat at 18%. $502M was spent on capex, up from $363M a year ago.
Nonetheless, free cash flow rose 30% to $1.2B, slightly exceeding non-GAAP net income. Facebook ended Q1 with $12.4B in cash/investments, and no debt.
The U.S./Canada (less than 15% of MAUs) accounted for 49% of revenue. U.S./Canada ARPU rose 42% Y/Y to $8.32, and global ARPU 25% to $2.50.

Ahead of Facebook's (FB +1.1%) afternoon Q1 report, Germany's Manager Magazin reports the social networking giant has expressed interest in Nokia's (NOK +1.7%) HERE mapping/navigation services unit. Uber, a consortium of German automakers, and a P-E firm have also reportedly shown interest.
The report comes after Nokia stated it's exploring options for HERE ahead of a planned merger with Alcatel-Lucent. The unit, which has had a tough time competing against Google Maps in Web/mobile mapping but has fared better in the automotive market, has been assigned a book value of €2B ($2.14B) by Nokia; many think it can fetch a higher price.
Facebook's PC site currently relies on Bing Maps, and its mobile apps on Google Maps. Owning a mapping platform could help Facebook deliver a better experience when integrating user/business data and local services with maps.
Separately, Facebook has launched Hello, an Android phone dialer app that relies on publicly-shared Facebook profile info to provide caller ID data and photos. No iOS version will launch due to Apple's app restrictions.
Hello (currently available in the U.S., Brazil, and Nigeria) also adds Facebook profile pictures and info to a user's contact book, integrates with Messenger to support free VoIP calls, and features a search bar that can be used to search for contacts/businesses. Much like the Home Android UI (hasn't lived up to expectations), it aims to strengthen Facebook's mindshare and engagement with Android users.
Shares are higher ahead of earnings. Though generally expecting strong numbers, several analysts have been slightly cautious due to forex concerns and high expectations; ad partner Nanigans recently reported solid Q1 figures.

Update (6:40PM ET): Bloomberg also reports Nokia, German automakers, and P-E firms are looking at HERE. It adds Nokia has reached out to Apple, Alibaba, Baidu, Amazon, Sirius, and Harman. First-round bids are reportedly due at the end of next week.

Though Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are squaring off more than ever following yesterday's Facebook F8 conference product launches, none of it is intentional, insists Mark Zuckerberg in a Wired interview.
Zuck: ""To the extent that we are doing measurement and Google did measurement, that’s just because Google is smart and they also realize that measurement is valuable ... Same on the video front ... we are not thinking about how we are competing with YouTube. We are thinking about how are we going to make it more useful for people to share stuff on Facebook.""
Facebook's launch of a mobile ad exchange (competes against Google's DoubleClick, leverages Facebook data) and embedded video support (YouTube dominates video embeds) has led to more than a few headlines declaring Facebook is out to take Google's lunch. The companies already compete in multiple ad markets.
On the mobile ad exchange front, at least, the competitive overlap might be less than some think. As Foreester's Jim Nail observes, DoubleClick's exchange, much like Google search, focuses on intent-based advertising (i.e. ads for items users have recently expressed interest in), while Facebook's natural strength is targeting based on a user's historical likes.
Other Facebook F8 news: 1) Facebook has provided details about Aquila, a solar-powered drone that will have a wingspan similar to a Boeing 767, and be used lasers to beam Web access to underserved regions. Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace last year. 2) Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash promises big things for virtual reality, once tech challenges are resolved.

Long a huge referral traffic source for the many online media firms that provide excerpts and links for their material on the company's site and apps, Facebook (FB +1%) is now in talks with at least a half-dozen media firms to fully host their content in exchange for a chance to profit from related ad revenue, the NYT reports.
The NYT itself is said to be one of the publishers Facebook is talking to, as are viral content giant BuzzFeed and National Geographic. Tests are expected to begin in ""the next several months."" Some publishers are reportedly wary of Facebook's overtures out of fear of losing site traffic and control over the user experience.
Facebook could pitch publishers on providing a quicker/more seamless content-viewing experience, as well as on countering the rising popularity of video on Facebook - the social networking giant's video views have soared to over 3B/day following the launch of autoplay videos.
Facebook hasn't been shy about wanting to act as a media platform for its 1.39B MAUs, though readers still often engage more with viral content than longer-form material. The NYT's report follows a December video clip deal with the NFL for which Facebook is sharing revenue produced by Verizon ads run against the NFL's content.
Shares have rallied above $85 in early trading, making new highs yet again.

397,2015-03-20,1.05,Facebook tops $84; Messenger reportedly turning into developer platform,"
 Following the lead of Line, WeChat, Snapchat, and other mobile messaging platforms, Facebook (FB +1.9%) will use its March 25-26 F8 developers' conference to ""announce new ways for third parties to offer experiences through its Messenger app,"" multiple sources tell TechCrunch

Facebook will initially ""focus on how third parties can build ways for content and information to flow through Messenger,"" and (depending on how the initial efforts go) might later support more features. No word on whether WhatsApp, which has taken a very minimalist approach to its service, will follow suit.
Line and WeChat have turned into huge revenue generators through their support for gaming, payments/e-commerce, stickers, and other value-added services, as well as ads. Line, owned by Korea's Naver (OTCPK:NHNCF), had Q4 revenue of $198.7M (+62% Y/Y) via just 181M MAUs; 60% of its revenue comes from games. Facebook recently told Bloomberg Messenger's user base has risen to 700M.
TechCrunch adds Facebook, which just added P2P payments support to Messenger (it's not collecting transaction fees for now), is intent on avoiding the spamming that took place for apps on its site (largely via game developers). Mark Zuckerberg has previously suggested he's not a fan of monetizing messaging platforms via ads.
Shares have topped $84 for the first time a day after taking out a December high of $82.17. A broader market rally is helping Facebook's cause today.  ",0.9842,positive,0.777874358974359

After dropping slightly yesterday following news Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is giving Messenger users the ability to send money to each other (though not to merchants), EBAY is seeing steeper losses today. Volume (11M shares) has exceeded a 3-month daily average of 8.5M.
Unlike PayPal, Facebook doesn't plan to charge transaction fees for the time being. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested he isn't interested in monetizing Messenger until it hits 1B users.
Though P2P money transfers are a small portion of PayPal's transaction volume, Facebook's service could substantially grow the number of payment card numbers it has on file. The company is in the midst of testing (with the help of PayPal rival Stripe) a Buy button that lets users pay for advertised items without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using previously-saved card data.
Buried within a Bloomberg column about Facebook's payments launch: Facebook says it now has 700M Messenger users. The company reported having 500M MAUs back in November.

399,2015-03-17,1.295,Facebook adds payments support to Messenger,"

Facebook (FB +1.7%) is updating its PC and mobile Messenger apps to allow users to send cash (via debit cards) to friends. A user sending money simply has to tap a $ icon, enter an amount, and tap a Pay button; a PIN can be created to provide security.
Facebook is less than a year removed from hiring ex-PayPal chief David Marcus to run Messenger. Mark Zuckerberg, for his part, has suggested for a while payments will be a part of Facebook's efforts to monetize Messenger, which has 500M+ MAUs thanks in part to Facebook's decision to remove messaging functionality from its core apps.
Many think WhatsApp, currently monetized in some markets via subscription fees, will eventually join rival messaging platforms in supporting payments. Facebook has promised it won't run ads on WhatsApp, and has more broadly argued ads aren't a good way to monetize messaging apps.
PayPal owner eBay (EBAY -0.1%) has ticked lower following Facebook's announcement. For now, Facebook's platform doesn't support merchant payments, which account for a far larger percentage of PayPal's transaction volume than consumer-to-consumer payments.

""There is no fear in Silicon Valley right now,"" proclaims Benchmark VC Bill Gurley, once more raising alarm bells about a perceived bubble in private tech funding and valuations. He predicts some ""unicorns"" - startups with $1B+ valuations, a club whose ranks have swelled rapidly over the last couple of years - will go belly-up in 2015.
Gurley expects Facebook (FB -0.7%) to be one of the companies hurt by the shakeout, given its dependence on mobile app install ads that are often sold to startups looking to gain exposure for their apps. Though Facebook hasn't given an exact number, install ads are believed to account for a large portion of the company's mobile ad sales, which in turn were 69% of its total Q4 ad revenue.
Gurley's remarks come as The Information reports Facebook will use its March 25-26 f8 conference to unveil tools that let developers track the performance of install ads both on Facebook and 3rd-party apps. Google and Twitter entered the install ad market last year; Google, which currently places install ads within mobile search results, is set to expand its offerings to include ads placed within the Google Play app.
Other Facebook news: 1) BofA/Merrill argues today Instagram is worth up to $37B, and WhatsApp up to $32B. It thinks each platform could eventually deliver ~$4B/year in revenue, and that Instagram's MAU count could top 500M next year. Cowen recently gave Instagram a $33B valuation. 2) Facebook has updated its community standards to clarify its stance on adult content, hate speech, regulated goods, and several other matters.

Blackledge: ""Instagram is a valuable asset for FB given its large, fast-growing and highly engaged user base that's drawing significant advertiser interest per our recent social user and ad buyer surveys."" He sees Instagram's MAU count (recently topped 300M) rising to 680M by 2020, and notes 72% of its users are aged 18-44. With Blackledge valuing Facebook Messenger at $10.5B and taking WhatsApp's $22B acquisition price at face value, he sees 23%-36% upside for Facebook's valuation on a sum-of-the-parts basis. For now, his target remains at $91. The note comes in a week that has seen Bloomberg report Snapchat could be valued at $19B in a new funding round, and the WSJ report Pinterest is seeking an $11B valuation in a new round. Separately, during a recent conference talk, Facebook product chief Chris Cox stated his company is working on virtual reality apps (presumably for Oculus' platform) and that Facebook is talking with publishers about getting them to fully publish (rather than just excerpt/link to) their content on Facebook, in exchange for a revenue cut.

Continuing its efforts to build (in Mark Zuckerberg's words) ""a pipeline of experiences"" on mobile, Facebook (FB +0.3%) has created standalone Android/iOS apps for monitoring and interacting with one's groups.
Group-related notifications are provided through the app, as is a Discover tab that recommends groups based on a user's interests. However, unlike with messaging, Facebook won't be removing Groups functionality from its core apps.
The Groups launch follows the October release of Rooms, an app that allows users to create discussion spaces while logging in with pseudonyms.
Separately, Hilliard Lyons' Stephen Turner has launched coverage on Facebook with a Buy rating and $92 target. Like others, Turner cites Facebook's ability to benefit from a shift in ad spend towards online/mobile channels - mobile still only accounts for 11% of U.S. ad spend vs. 25% of media time.

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) aggressive 2015 spending forecast isn't driven by any particular field, but by large investments in everything from the core service to ad tech to new products, CFO Dave Wehner insisted on the CC. He suggested much of the new spending will be on hiring. (live blogs: I, II)
Price per ad soared 274% Y/Y in Q3, thanks in part to an overhaul of Facebook's right-hand column PC ads (they typically carry lower prices). With total ad revenue up ""only"" 64%, ad impressions fell 56% (fewer ads are shown on mobile).
PC ad sales rose 11% Y/Y, but were flat Q/Q. Though payments/other revenue rose 13% Y/Y, payments volume from games fell 2% due to lower PC gaming activity (a negative for ZNGA, which is down 1% AH).
Sheryl Sandberg notes only 11% of ad budgets are for mobile, and predicts improving inaccurate measurement systems (previous) will boost ROI and spending. She reiterates Facebook will take it slow in ramping Instagram and video ads, and that Facebook is aiming for Instagram to eventually have 1B users of its own (up over 4x from current levels).
Mark Zuckerberg cautions Oculus is unlikely to see 50M-100M unit shipments in the next few years, but reiterates he wants Oculus' VR headsets to be a mass-market product long-term. He also states Facebook plans to make new investments in growing public content viewing/sharing, where its focus on privately connecting friends/family can make for a tricky balancing act.
Facebook discloses WhatsApp (just beginning to monetize) had 2013 revenue of just $10.2M, and a loss of $138M ($98.8M from stock compensation).
Other details: 1) Of the 33M MAUs added in Q3, only 6M came from North America and Europe. 2) ARPU rose to $2.40 from $2.24 in Q2 and $1.72 a year ago. North American ARPU ($7.39) remains an outlier. 3) 456M MAUs (34% of them) are mobile-only.

Rooms, a Facebook (FB +2.6%) app launching today on iOS (Android support should arrive in time), allows users to create discussion spaces (i.e. rooms) on specific topics. The rooms can contain text, photos, and videos, as well as comments from other users.Notably, the app doesn't require users to give their real names (a pseudonym will do), or even have a Facebook account. Invites to an individual room can be obtained by taking a picture or screenshot of a room's QR code.The app, vaguely outlined in an Oct. 7 NYT report, is arguably a response by Facebook to the popularity of pseudonymous discussion platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and legions of Web message boards, and a recognition of the limits on discussion that stem from Facebook's real-identity requirement and focus on connecting with friends/family.Josh Miller, head of the team responsible for Rooms: ""We don’t want this to be a place where you talk to friends ... There are many people out there that you didn’t go to high school with that you want to connect with."" He adds the app is meant to be media-intensive. ""If links are the currency of the web, photos are the currency of mobile.""While Facebook's core services, Instagram, and WhatsApp continue faring quite well, the same doesn't hold for many of the new Facebook apps launched over the last two years.

Thanks to its relatively strong October performance, Facebook's (FB +4.6%) market cap ($188.8B) is bigger than IBM's ($179.4B). The 10-year-old company now has the 5th-highest market cap in the tech universe, behind only Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba.
Meanwhile, Facebook partner Nanigans (provides software for managing Facebook ad campaigns) reports (.pdf) its clients saw their ad click rates rise 56% Q/Q and 195% Y/Y to 0.56%. Y/Y growth improved from 146% in Q2.
The average prices for 1K ads sold on a CPM basis rose 80% Q/Q and 298% Y/Y to $2.98, while the average price for individual ads sold on a CPC basis fell 4% Q/Q and rose 30% Y/Y to $0.53. Mobile made up 62% of spending, up from 56% in Q2.
Nanigans attributes the huge CPM growth to strong demand for news feed ads - their CPM rose 153% Y/Y to $5.62 - declining interest in cheaper right-hand column ads, larger right-hand column ad units, and (perhaps more interestingly) a 38% Q/Q increase in the use Facebook's Optimized CPM platform, which gives advertisers more control over campaigns and delivers better targeting.

Facebook (FB +0.2%) has officially launched an overhauled version of its Atlas ad-measurement/serving platform. As previously reported, the revamped Atlas uses Facebook profile info to allow advertisers to track the performance of Facebook and non-Facebook ads, and (leveraging Facebook data) also allows them to make automated ad buys for inventory on 3rd-party sites/apps.
Instagram and ad giant Omnicom are among the first supporters. Marin Software (MRIN -0.3%) is among the ad tech supporters - its platform will be integrated with Atlas to allow clients to better measure their ROI on search ad campaigns.
Interestingly, Re/code reports hearing Facebook has ""talked to Twitter"" about supporting Atlas. The site adds some think Facebook's main goal with the platform is to leverage the data it obtains about 3rd-party ad sales to improve the effectiveness of its internal ad sales.
Instagram has been blocked in China as protests erupt in Hong Kong. Until now, the photo-sharing platform has been available in China even as Facebook's core services are generally blocked. Many Chinese celebrities claim 100K+ Instagram followers.
Ello, a new social network that pitches itself as the anti-Facebook - it refuses to sell ads, and plans to monetize by charging for value-added features - has been quickly gaining users. According to one estimate, over 35K people have been asking to sign up per hour.
With Facebook claiming 1.32B MAUs at the end of Q2 (204M in North America), its network effect remains a big hurdle for Ello and other would-be rivals.

By anonymously linking ad measurement to Facebook profiles, Facebook aims to once more leverage its user data for ad targeting (previous), and provide better tracking across PCs and mobile than is possible via cookies. Atlas will also feature a programmatic (automated) ad-buying interface for marketers.
As The Information reported last month, Facebook aims to use a revamped Atlas, its mobile ad network, and LiveRail's video ad platform (together with its data) to offer a full ad tech ""stack"" that can challenge Google's (GOOG -1.1%) huge DoubleClick display ad unit for the dollars of marketers buying ad inventory on 3rd-party sites/apps.
Naturally, Google hasn't been standing idly either. The company bought ad measurement platform Adometry last spring, and has been working on tools to better track cross-device and offline activity. The company has also launched an app install ad service (competes against Facebook's very popular offering) for AdWords search ads.

WhatsApp (FB +0.6%) now has over 600M monthly active users (MAUs), CEO Jan Koum declares. The mobile messaging leader had only topped 500M in April, and had 450M at the time the Facebook deal was announced in mid-February.
Mark Zuckerberg has long been confident WhatsApp will eventually have over 1B users, and has even reportedly suggested WhatsApp could eventually have a bigger base than Facebook proper. Facebook claimed 1.32B MAUs at the end of Q2.
Meanwhile, comScore estimates Facebook's core app had 115.4M U.S. unique visitors in June, 32M more than the second-most-popular U.S. app (YouTube) and good for a 72% penetration rate. Globally, Facebook had 1.07B mobile MAUs at the end of June.
comScore estimates Instagram had 46.6M U.S. users (#8 overall), and Facebook Messenger 39.2M (#12). WhatsApp, often used as an SMS replacement abroad, didn't crack the top-25, as U.S. users continue relying heavily on the SMS services often bundled with their mobile plans.
Not surprisingly, comScore's data also suggests core Facebook's U.S. base skews older, and Instagram's base skews younger. Whereas core Facebook accounts for 18.4% of the time spent on apps by U.S. users aged 35-54, it accounts for 14.8% among those aged 18-24. Whereas Instagram accounts for just 1.2% of the time spent by the former group, and 6.6% of the time spent by the latter.

While Facebook does plenty of business with e-commerce advertisers - Nanigans' Q2 numbers drive this home - users have until now had to leave Facebook to finish a transaction (virtual goods purchases excepted).

The app arrives after Facebook reportedly made a failed $3B+ bid to acquire Snapchat, prior to turning its sights on WhatsApp. Facebook's Poke app, its first attempt to take on Snapchat, was shuttered in May.

Though Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) core site and apps largely remain blocked in China, Instagram has been growing rapidly in the Middle Kingdom. The photo-sharing platform's iOS app is now ranked #66 in the Chinese App Store, and a number of Chinese celebrities have 100K+ followers for their Instagram accounts (largely from within China).
The widespread use of Instagram with the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) microblogging platform (129M MAUs) has fueled much of the growth. Instagram has added a Weibo sharing option for its apps, and its pictures are often used by Weibo posters to cover major events.
Bloomberg reported in May Facebook is taking steps to open a Chinese ad sales office, but there aren't any signs its core services will soon be given a green light. WhatsApp isn't blocked, but it faces an uphill battle wresting Chinese share from Tencent's WeChat.

""Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is not one thing. On desktop where we grew up, the mode that made the most sense was to have a website ... In mobile there’s a big premium on creating single-purpose first-class experiences,"" says Mark Zuckerberg in an NYT interview, highlighting his company's focus on unbundling its various services on mobile, where screen real estate is limited and each app represents just one home screen icon.
The remarks follow a TechCrunch report stating Facebook plans to remove messaging from its core app, thereby requiring users who want the feature to download the standalone Messenger app (and potentially triggering a backlash).
Zuck adds Facebook want to ""build a pipeline of experiences"" for users, and that his company's Creative Labs unit is ""[exploring] things that aren’t all tied to Facebook identity."" Those remarks arguably speak to the popularity (particularly among certain demographics) of rival platforms that don't require real names.
He also suggests he's unfazed by the muted early reception for Graph Search, arguing it's a 5-year project more focused on mobile than PCs (where it launched).

The more users you have, the harder it is to innovate, because most will be averse to any change ...

Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe promises the Rift will get much more comfortable and portable over time. ""A decade or two from now, it will be nothing but sunglasses."" If/when that happens, Rift might be squaring off against Google Glass.

Though Facebook agree to pay $45 per WhatsApp MAU, Martin thinks that figure will drop to $23/MAU within a year, given WhatsApp's growth trajectory. She also notes Facebook ($140/MAU) and Twitter ($180/MAU) have much higher per-MAU valuations (ed: unlike WhatsApp, both platforms are also monetized via ads rather than subscriptions), and that WhatsApp averages 14 sessions/user in some markets.
The gains come as Mark Zuckerberg talks shop at the Mobile World Congress. Zuck trumpets Facebook's Internet.org initiative to provide free Web access in emerging markets - Facebook is looking for 3-5 mobile carrier partners, and doesn't expect the effort to be profitable for a while - and suggests WhatsApp will be Facebook's last big acquisition for some time.

Zuck also argues WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger serve different purposes - the former acts as an SMS replacement, the latter as a way to have IM-like chats with friends.
Facebook's presentation slides (.pdf) note WhatsApp's daily traffic includes 19B messages (approaching global SMS levels), 600M+ photos, and 100M+ video messages, and that these figures are all up over 100% Y/Y.

Like Flipboard (the market's leader), LinkedIn's Pulse, and Google Currents, Paper allows users to browse articles (split up into topics) and social media updates via horizontal swiping, and features an image-heavy UI. But it (naturally) places a much bigger emphasis on Facebook browsing, and also offers advanced tools for uploading content.

The Verge: ""[Paper is] much more than just a news-reading app — it's a complete reimagining of Facebook itself. Once you've used it, you may never want to open the standard Facebook app again.""

""As you start changing the way you’re displaying this content, we hope that it will change the way people think about posting content.""
Meanwhile a BloombergBusinessweek cover story about Facebook's 10th anniversary mentions the company will (like Twitter and Instagram) soon allow users of certain apps to log in anonymously.

Teen engagement worries or not, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still the unquestioned colossus of the U.S. social media scene. A Pew survey (.pdf) of 6,010 Americans found 71% claiming to use Facebook, up from 67% in 2012. That compares with 22% for LinkedIn (LNKD - up from 20%), 21% for Pinterest (up from 15%), 18% for Twitter (TWTR - up from 16%), and 17% for Facebook-owned Instagram (up from 13%).
Facebook's success at reeling in older users has helped it continue growing: 45% of respondents age 65 or older said they use Facebook, up from 35% a year ago. 63% of users say they check in daily, and 22% weekly.
Unsurprisingly, Twitter and Instagram's user bases skew young: 31% and 37% of respondents in the age 18-29 demographic respectively use Twitter and Instagram, compared with 9% and 6% in the 50-64 demographic. 46% of Twitter users say they check in daily, a level notably below Facebook's 63% and Instagram's 57%.
A mere 13% of LinkedIn users claim to check in daily, evidence the company's efforts to boost engagement need more work. But the platform is used by 38% of respondents making over $75K, and 27% of all employed respondents. LinkedIn's recruiting and ad clients will be happy to know that.
North America accounted for only 17% of Facebook's Q3 MAUs, but produced 48% of its Q3 revenue. The U.S. accounted for 74% of Twitter's Q3 revenue, and 62% of LinkedIn's.

Cantor's Youssef Squali believes Facebook's (FB +4.5%) ad load (the proportion of news feed content consisting of ads) has doubled in Q4 to 10%. Though Facebook typically sees its ad load rise in Q4 Squali thinks there's an improvement in ad quality this time around, with more sales to major brands and ""a greater mix of higher-priced click-to-play video ads.""
The remarks come only two months after Facebook made investors nervous by stating it won't significantly increase its news feed ad load going forward, and will focus on improving quality.
In addition to Squali's note, shares could also be getting a lift from the fact Facebook's 70M-share, $3.85B stock offering was priced at only a modest discount to where shares traded before the offering was first announced.
Meanwhile, Facebook has struck a deal with T-Mobile USA (TMUS +0.9%) to offer free access to Facebook and Facebook Messenger to users of the #4 U.S. carrier's GoSmart prepaid services, whether or not they have data plans.

Instagram Direct, a new service being launched at the mobile photo-sharing platform's NYC event (previous), allows Instagram (FB +3.9%) users to privately send photos and videos to up to 15 users. The photos can be accessed via Instagram's main feed, and are complemented by a group chat feature.

Om Malik previously reported Instagram was prepping a private messaging service. Though much attention is being given to how Direct compares to Snapchat, which Facebook reportedly tried to buy for $3B+, it's arguably more a response to the rise of mobile messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Kik, Line, and Viber, particularly in international markets.
Those messaging platforms are viewed as a threat to Facebook's mobile engagement rates, particularly as they develop app/services ecosystems around them. WhatsApp alone has 350M+ monthly active users (MAUs); Instagram reached 150M in September, and Facebook proper is at 1.19B.
Direct is also arguably a response to Twitter (TWTR -1.3%), which recently updated its apps to support private photo-sharing, and to place greater emphasis on private messaging in general. Twitter also recently began showing image previews in its Timelines.
Instagram hasn't announced a printing service, as was expected by many.

The update is aimed squarely at contending with the popularity of mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Kik, Line, and Viber. Though centered around basic messaging services, the apps have added support for photo/video-sharing, 3rd-party games, and even payments, and in doing so represent a challenge to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter's engagement rates.
WhatsApp alone had 350M+ monthly active users (MAUs) as of October, and Line has 300M+ registered users. Twitter had 231.7M MAUs at the end of Q3.

Morgan Stanley's Scott Devitt is out with another bullish note on Groupon. Devitt notes an MS survey of 358 SMBs found only 26% of merchants have run Groupon deals in the last 12 months, something he thinks suggests there's ""a long run way of merchants"" that can still be signed up.
He also sees room for Groupon to improve its customer targeting - the company still isn't able to track which deals were shown to customers, or were clicked on, in prior e-mails - and expects its new site (allows deals to be browsed without an e-mail address being given) and a revamped e-mail layout to boost growth.

As part of an Internet sector coverage launch, FBR's William Bird has assigned Outperform ratings to Facebook (FB +1.4%) and Monster (MWW +2%), while respectively giving the companies PTs of $60 and $7.
Taking a big-picture view of things, Bird calls Facebook ""an investment in a large-scale data-rich platform run by a group of highly innovative people who are likely to continually develop more ideas for improving engagement and monetizing it.""
Bird adds that while ""no one really knows how big Facebook can be,"" he thinks it has ""significant greenfield opportunity in front of it,"" and that its ad pricing is ""inflecting.""
Monster, meanwhile, is called a play on job recovery, strategic initiatives, and buybacks. Bird argues Monster's low valuation (caused in large part by share losses to LinkedIn) minimize risk, and notes buybacks have already lowered the jobs site's share count by 11% this year. He thinks a 60% share count reduction is possible over the next three years.
Monster flew higher earlier this month after providing mixed Q3 results and above-consensus Q4 EPS guidance, and announcing the sale of a 49.9% stake in Korean site JobKorea.

Not spooked by ad trends, BMO downgrades Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from Buy to Hold anyway due to the lack of visibility surrounding the opportunity in Social TV advertising. For the stock to move higher, the Social TV story is needed ... the rest is priced in.
Deutsche: ""We think the ad-load issue is going to weigh on the multiple but don’t see it as net risk to estimates ... would add to positions on pullbacks.""
Noting decelerating user growth, steady newsfeed ad load, and several data points suggesting engagement in developed markets isn't growing that much, Bernstein suggests revenue growth must increasingly come from rising price-per-ad. ""We don’t think there is enough visibility into the demand for Facebook ads to make a high conviction call on the stock.""
Calling the big selling amid the CC an ""over-reaction,"" Pivotal Research ups to a Buy with price target lifted to $57 from $48. ""So long as [teens] can be reached on Facebook to a degree and so long as FB has a unique capability to reach more total people than any other media owner, Facebook retains advantage in its ad sales efforts against most advertisers.""
Evercore's Ken Sena boosts his estimates and hikes the price target $5 to $65. Even assuming the absence of ad load growth beyond 2014 (which he's not sure will happen), says Sena, his Street-high estimates can still be met thanks to the remaining three ad growth drivers: users, engagement, and pricing.

As AllThingsD's Peter Kafka observes, the deal is a big one, given FBX's growth and DoubleClick's huge display ad market presence; Bid Manager already supports dozens of online ad exchanges.
Whereas Facebook had granted FBX access to ad tech platforms from AOL, Adobe, and many others, Bid Manager was a notable exception, reportedly due to concerns Google would gain access to valuable pricing/inventory data it could use to better compete against FBX.
Kafka: ""Either Google has made concessions to Facebook to get access to Facebook’s inventory, or Facebook has decided that working with its biggest competitor is better than shutting it out. Or both.""

Engineering and products VP Greg Badros is the latest Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) exec to depart. The WSJ reported of two other departures earlier this week.
A former Google exec, Badros held a number of positions during his 4 years at Facebook; most recently, he was in charge of the company's search product efforts. His departure comes shortly after Facebook launched Graph Search.
A new Facebook research team is using an artificial intelligence technique known as deep learning to better decipher the meaning and importance (or lack thereof) of news feed content, and in doing so predict user actions and determine what content should go to the top of a news feed.
A Facebook researcher suggests deep learning could also be used to help users organize content and making sharing/upload decisions. Google, aided by Ray Kurzweil, is looking to apply deep learning to search.
Facebook's news feed algorithm (depends on human judgment rather than AI) already takes into account nearly 100K factors to decide where content is placed within a news feed.
Facebook's iOS apps have been given an iOS 7-friendly overhaul (video).

 Countering the view that matching Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) huge share of PC usage on mobile will be tough due to the fact it's simply one of many installed apps on user devices, Mark Zuckerberg stated at TechCrunch Disrupt Facebook accounts for 1/5 of user time spent mobile (per comScore), better than its 1/7 share on PCs. Zuck also insisted Facebook isn't giving up on its oft-criticized Home Android UI. Home will soon integrate content from Instagram and 3rd-party social networks (Twitter?), and will also begin to be promoted via Facebook's site/apps. Facebook has been gradually addressing user complaints about Home, but it still only has a rating of 2.5/5 stars on Google Play. A lot of time was spent talking up Facebook's efforts to grow its developer ecosystem, and in doing so become a platform that 3rd-party sites/apps rely on for much more than basic social sharing. The app development/management tools Facebook obtained by acquiring startup Parse are central to those efforts.  Parse, used by 100K+ apps, rolled out a big update last week that included new analytics tools and cloud services modules. Investors are taking Zuck's talk in stride. FB +0.3% AH after rising 3.3% in regular trading.

Facebook's mobile ad sales surged 75% Q/Q in Q2 to $656M. Google doesn't break out its mobile ad sales (or much else), but did note last October its mobile revenue (ads + Google Play) was on an $8B/year run rate.

They also argue Facebook is ""ideally positioned to break historical barriers to entry"" in the payments market (previous) on account of its 1M ad buyers, 1.1B users, and widespread adoption of Facebook Connect by third-party sites/apps.

RJ's Aaron Kessler (Strong Buy) says talks with marketing developers indicate ""the outlook for Facebook advertising demand remains positive"" thanks to the company's mobile positioning, growing direct advertiser support, international sales, and ""increasing traction"" with consumer goods/automotive advertisers. Ad demand is said to be flat Q/Q due to seasonality.

Also: Facebook is replacing two credit facilities worth a combined $6.5B with a new 5-year facility worth the same amount, and sporting an interest rate of LIBOR + 1%.
