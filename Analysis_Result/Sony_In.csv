 A Q3 wrap-up of videogame sales showed consumer spending in the sector rose 24% Y/Y, hitting $9.1B overall. That's the July-September period before the key holiday release season, which kicked off with a bang last month via a record October spurred by new Call of Duty (ATVI -6.1%) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (TTWO -2.5%) releases. Videogame content sales were up 25% to $7.9B, NPD Group says, with broad gains led by mobile games and digital content for consoles/portables. Hardware sales were up 11% for the quarter, to $737M, while accessory sales rose 44% with all-time quarterly records in headsets as well as in game cards. The software releases with the biggest quarterly impact on dollar sales, according to NPD Group?

 As part of today's hearing into FTC oversight, agency Chairman Joe Simons promised he would look into videogame ""loot boxes"" -- a method of recurring revenue that's growing increasingly important for big game releases. Such boxes, which in the game contain virtual items like powerful weapons or equipment, can be bought with real money and are a growing revenue stream for videogame makers faced with huge budgets for their games. Those boxes are ""endemic"" to the industry from console flagships to smartphone apps, Sen. Maggie Hassan said in the hearing. She shares other observer's concerns about such boxes contributing to problem gambling. Sen. Ed Markey expressed concerns about manipulative loot-box marketing, including a character who continues to cry if the child playing the game doesn't make a purchase.

 Sony (NYSE:SNE) is sitting solidly 4.9% higher in NYSE trading after its quarterly results featured a huge boost to operating profit outlook thanks in large part to accelerating trends toward a record year at its videogaming operation.

 Keeping up a push by Chinese firms into Hollywood, China's richest man says he has two billion-dollar deals in the pipeline and an eye beyond that to taking over one of the industry's Big Six. Wang Jianlin, of Dalian Wanda Group, tells Reuters that after acquiring a pair of non-production companies, he'd like to take over one of the major studios: Twentieth Century Fox (FOX, FOXA), Warner Brothers (NYSE:TWX), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Universal Pictures (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Columbia (NYSE:SNE), along with Paramount (VIA, VIAB), for which Wanda was said to be nearing a $4B purchase of 49%. Paramount is certainly in play, with flagging performance and a parent (Viacom) struggling with that and its TV business. But that's not all Wang has his eye on: ""We are interested not only in Paramount, but all of them. If one of the Big Six would be willing to be sold to us, we would be interested."" That's a ""necessary step"" to building a ""real movie empire,"" Wang says. ""Only the six are real global film companies, while the rest are not."" Wanda bought control of production company Legendary Entertainment for $3.5B this year and wants to triple revenue from its cultural division to 150B yuan ($22.6B) by 2020. The conglomerate also controls theater firm AMC Entertainment, and with the completion of acquisitions of Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group and Carmike Cinemas, would control 15% of global box office revenues.

 The question of whether Sony (SNE +0.7%) would create a slimmer, lighter-weight version of its current top-selling PlayStation 4 console or roll out a newer, higher-powered version seems to be settled: It's doing both. When it holds its ""PlayStation Meeting"" in two weeks, the electronics giant will produce two new versions of the PS4 -- a new slimmer and cheaper standard model, along with a high-end version that supports 4K video, The Wall Street Journal says. It would mean a change in strategy, since Sony has tended to stick to one model at a time. Production limits are in place on the current PS4 as the company readies a shift in inventory. It also signals a push to accelerate the PlayStation business, which the company says is its leading growth engine, ahead of the rollout of PlayStation VR.

 Sony (NYSE:SNE) leapt 17.6% today in U.S. trading after dusting analyst expectations with a 33.5% gain in profits, largely on the back of its media business. Videogames sold well and its film unit's operating income jumped 227%, largely on the back of James Bond entry Spectre and Halloween hit Hotel Transylvania 2.
 Revenues at Sony Pictures rose 28% to $2.18B, chiefly from theatrical revenues. Home entertainment declined slightly, as the previous year benefited from home sales of 22 Jump Street and The Equalizer.
 It's seeing lower overhead than before as well, thanks in some part to smaller incentive compensation. Music generated 瞼27.4B ($228M) in operating profit based on hits from Adele and One Direction. Companywide, operating income was up 11% to 瞼202B ($1.69B).

 Walt Disney (DIS -0.8%) launched Disney Infinity 3.0 for the Apple TV today, and unlike many games for the box, it comes with a chunky controller usually seen with higher-end gaming consoles. That could prove a critical test of whether the platform could support more intense gaming, and present real competition to the top two consoles made by Sony (NYSE:SNE) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Most all games on Apple TV are controlled by the device's slender remote. But the Nimbus controller made by SteelSeries (specifically for Apple's device) features analog sticks and D-pads familiar to console gamers, and sells for $50 (but at a $15 discount in the Infinity 3.0 bundle). Disney's entry in the toys-to-life category has underperformed compared to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders -- also now on Apple TV -- but the combination of content brands that Disney can leverage for the free-form game, including Marvel and Star Wars, has kept hopes high for the platform.

Streaming services (including Spotify, Pandora (NYSE:P), and Apple's Beats Music) showed strong growth in 2014, with revenues that grew a combined 39% Y/Y.

 Spotify's close to a deal on a seventh funding round, which would raise $400M and value the service at $8.4B, The Wall Street Journal reports -- launching it into rarefied air. There's still no timeline for an IPO. An $8B valuation means investors place it at more than twice the worth of key competition Pandora Media (NYSE:P). Spotify was valued at $4B-$5B last summer and fall. Like Pandora, Spotify is losing money and needs cash to support heavy royalty payments. Spotify's minority ownership of record companies -- including Universal Music Group (OTCPK:VIVHY), Sony Music Entertainment (NYSE:SNE) and Warner Music Group -- have pressed for higher conversion of free users to paying subscribers. Along with Pandora, Spotify faces intensifying competition with likely new entries from Apple and Google, along with Jay-Z's high-bitrate service Tidal.

It's been testing the service since November and had planned to launch this month in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia for PlayStation 3 and 4 users, though the price and lineup were open (and vital) questions. The service will spread to other cities and to iPads soon. Overall the service features more than 85 channels, though the $50 package has some 50 stations and $60/month and $70/month packages add local sports and music/lifestyle/family channels respectively. The lineup features content from three of the big four (CBS, Fox, NBC) as well as stations from Discovery, Scripps, Turner and Viacom. AMC content will join from April. Disney (NYSE:DIS) -- and its popular content from ABC, ESPN and Disney cable -- is still a glaring omission. Sony VP Eric Lempel says more content deals are in progress. The interface features time-shifting for the last three days of ""popular programming,"" which might give it a leg up on Sling TV's (NASDAQ:DISH) limited capability there.

 The MPAA's report on global box office notes that 2014 sales were up 1% to $36.4B, lifted by China's industry -- the first time that Asian revenues passed those of other regions. China's $4.8B made it the first foreign market to exceed $4B a year. Domestic sales of $10.4B were down 5%. In 2013 the three major regions (North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia Pacific) essentially tied, but 2014 was the year of Asian box office share: 34.1% vs. 29.1% in EMEA and 28.6% in North America. Among worries for the industry, The Hollywood Reporter notes 32% of North America's audience didn't go to a movie at all, and that steep dropoffs in ages 2-11 and 25-39 means the industry needs to look at long-term audience growth. (Frequent moviegoers make up just 11% of the population but buy 51% of the tix.) The U.S. industry might be frontloaded for a rebound with a franchise- and sequel-heavy 2015 ahead, though.

Multiple sources tell VG 24/7 Amazon (AMZN +1.3%) plans to launch ""a dedicated games and entertainment device this year priced below $300."" Not surprisingly, the device reportedly runs on Android and is the work of Amazon's secretive Lab 126 unit (responsible for its Kindle hardware).
Amazon is said to be meeting with game publishing execs to brief them on the hardware, and has used popular Android/iOS titles to demo the device.
The report comes after Amazon sent out an invite for a developer event in which the company claimed it's ""working on a new revolutionary [Version 1] product that will allow us to deliver Digital Media to customers in new ways.""
There were several reports (I, II) last year stating an Amazon set-top is in development, with some claiming the device would also act as a console. The Verge reported in October Amazon's box had been delayed.

Google is also reportedly working on an Android set-top/console, and Apple is reportedly planning to launch a refreshed Apple TV with game support.
Amazon, Google, and Apple's rumored devices are all seen trying to disrupt the traditional console market by offering cheaper casual gaming/video-streaming systems that support the rapid porting of mobile games. If the reports pan out, Sony (SNE +1%), Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) won't be thrilled.

 Movie studios have bucked up for fewer Super Bowl ads this year after the companies have failed to get the bang for the buck in the past amid edgy competition for viewers' attention. Sony (NYSE:SNE), Lions Gate (LGF), Paramount (NASDAQ:VIAB) all have spots lined up, while Disney (NYSE:DIS) is still negotiating to add another two or three commercials for a slate of movies across its studios, but the overall number of movie ads will be lower than in the last few years. What to watch: Media analysts think 2014 will see slight shift in spending by studios across properties as they try to shift away from the tired superhero/sequel model. However, they also concede that the year might be just a blip on the radar before the Star Wars franchise reboots and Superman teams up with Batman in a highly-anticipated Warner Bros.

Initial reviews and first takes for the PS4 have been decent.
