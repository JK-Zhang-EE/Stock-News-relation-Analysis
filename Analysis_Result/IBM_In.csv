98,2016-04-27,1.217,IBM refreshes flash storage lineup with systems featuring Micron flash memory,"

The A9000R targets enterprises and large service providers. It uses a more traditional rack architecture, and can feature up to 1.8PB (1,800TB) of capacity, 12 controllers, and 8 nodes, with each controller able to connect to each node. Also launched: The DS8888, a flash array meant for mainframes.
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is supplying the high-performance flash memory that goes into IBM?�s systems, thanks to a multi-year alliance between the firms. Big Blue touts a low minimum latency of 250 microseconds for its systems even with various data services turned on, the inclusion of cloud-friendly features such as multi-tenancy, and a storage cost as low as $1.50/GB thanks to data-reduction features.
Also: IBM says it plans to launch a flash system in Q3 that?�s aimed at big data/analytics workloads (it?�s being developed in partnership with SanDisk), and that it will offer a version of the A9000R that can scale out to multiple racks.
The products stem from a commitment (announced in 2013) to invest $1B in flash R&D. IBM, a top player in the flash array market along with EMC, HP Enterprise, and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), is clearly taking flash storage seriously, as a growing number of enterprise and cloud app workloads migrate to SSDs. However, rivals are as well. EMC?�s DSSD unit recently unveiled its first flash array, while listing impressive throughput (IOPS), bandwidth, and latency figures. Around the same time, Pure Storage launched a scale-out system called FlashBlade that promises a cost of less than $1 per usable capacity.

IBM's official Q1 tax rate was -95.1%, thanks to a $1.2B benefit related to a $1B refund of previously-paid U.S. taxes. That yielded official tax payments of -$983M, and helped EPS beat estimates in spite of a 170 bps Y/Y drop in gross margin to 46.5% and $1.5B worth of expenses related to ""workforce transformation, real estate actions, and actions in Latin America.""

Segment performance: IBM has revised its segment reporting structure. Cognitive Solutions (solutions software + transaction processing software) revenue fell 1.7% Y/Y to $4B, with op. margin dropping to 21.8% from 32.6%. Global Business Services revenue -4.3% to $4.1B, with op. margin dropping to 4.5% from 13.2%.Tech Services & Cloud Platforms revenue -1.5% to $8.4B; op. margin dropped to 3% from 13%. Systems (hardware) revenue -21.8% to $1.7B (the mainframe upgrade cycle played a role); op. margin dropped to -0.5% from 11.3%. Global Financing revenue -11.2% to $410M; op. margin fell to 43.1% from 49.2%.

Other details:?1) Unlike in prior earnings reports, IBM hasn't broken out its geographic performance or services backlog, or broken out sales growth for various hardware and software businesses. 2) ""Strategic imperatives"" revenue (cloud, analytics, and ""engagement"") rose 14% Y/Y to $7B (compares with a 5% drop in total revenue to $18.7B). 3) The annual ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue run rate (boosted some by M&A) rose 42% Y/Y to $5.4B. 4) Mobile revenue rose 88% Y/Y, security 18%, and analytics 7%. 5) Forex had a 300 bps impact on revenue growth (-5% vs. -2%).

Financials: $900M was spent on buybacks. Thanks partly to the aforementioned expenses, SG&A spend rose 12% Y/Y to $6.01B, and R&D spend 12% to $1.46B.

Believing IBM's (IBM +5.7%) current valuation doesn't reflect the company's efforts to grow its cloud/analytics exposure, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty has upgraded to Overweight and set a $140 target.
Huberty: ""IBM Strategic Imperatives - data, cloud, engagement - now make up 35% of revenue and grew 17% in 2015, or 26% at constant currency, reflecting a faster-than-expected transformation to higher growth / higher value solutions. For comparison, Microsoft Cloud (Azure + Office 365) accounted for 36% of revenue and grew 20% in 2015. Yet IBM's share price reflects a perpetual decline in residual income, and these higher growth categories are undervalued based on our sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis.""
Of note: While IBM's Strategic Imperatives revenue rose 17% in 2015, total revenue fell 9% (1% exc. forex) after adjusting for divestitures. Free cash flow rose by $700M Y/Y to $13.1B, but is forecast to drop to $11B-$12B in 2016.
Regardless, Huberty expects the perceived disconnect between IBM's growth efforts and valuation to correct itself with the help of disclosures at IBM's Feb. 25 analyst day, stabilizing revenue, and improving free cash flow. She goes as far as to argue IBM ""warrants a premium over other hardware companies that haven't invested heavily to transform to new computing paradigms,"" and predicts the company will deliver 2% annual free cash flow growth over the next two years (better than a consensus of -5%).

In a big expansion of the company's healthcare bet, IBM's Watson Health unit is buying Truven Health Analytics, a provider of healthcare data and analytics services for healthcare providers, enterprises, governments, and life sciences firms, for $2.6B from investment firm Veritas Capital. The deal is expected to close later this year.
The deal comes six months after one to buy top medical imaging software firm Merge Healthcare, and ten months after the purchases of patient data analysis software firm Phytel and clinical database provider Explorys. The Phytel/Explorys deals coincided with the launch of Watson Health, which aims to provide software/services that can deliver insights from large volumes of anonymized patient data.
Truven has over 8,500 clients, and will boost the size of Watson Health to over 5,000 employees. IBM: ""Upon completion of the acquisition, IBM's health cloud will house one of the world's largest and most diverse collections of health-related data, representing an aggregate of approximately 300 million patient lives acquired from three companies. IBM plans to integrate Truven's extensive cloud-based data set spanning hundreds of different types of cost, claims, quality and outcomes information with its existing data sets.""

IBM suggests the value of The Weather Co.'s cloud data platform goes well beyond weather, and will bolster both its Watson Cloud platform and a new Watson IoT unit that will provide A.I.-driven analytics services for data produced by Web-connected embedded devices.
IBM: ""The Weather Company's cloud-based data platform will allow IBM to collect an even larger variety and higher velocity of global data sets, store them, analyze them and in turn distribute them and empower richer and deeper insights across the Watson platform ... The Weather Company's mobile and web properties handle seven times the volume of the world's leading search engine, while serving 82 million unique monthly visitors ... [The platform] can ingest a wide range of data at massive speed and scale, supporting an incredible volume of queries at very low latency.""
At the same time, IBM argues weather-related analytics is a major opportunity by itself, given weather's impact on global GDP. It notes The Weather Co.'s models ""analyze data from three billion weather forecast reference points, more than 40 million smartphones, and 50,000 airplane flights per day,"" helping it service ""more than 5,000 clients in the media, aviation, energy, insurance and government industries.""

StrongLoop provides software tools for creating and managing APIs for apps using the open-source and increasingly popular Node.js runtime environment (used to create server-based Web apps written in JavaScript). IBM (IBM +0.7%) is buying the company for an undisclosed sum.
Big Blue plans to integrate StrongLoop's products with its WebSphere middleware/app server line, as well as with its Bluemix cloud app development platform. IBM: ""Combining StrongLoop's tools and services with IBM's WebSphere and Java capabilities, IBM will help clients bridge Java and Node.js development platforms ... Through integration on IBM Bluemix, these Java and Node.js communities will also have access today to many other IBM and third-party services including access to Mobile Services, data analytics and Watson.""
Back in March, IBM bought A.I./deep learning API provider AlchemyAPI. The company's middleware revenue (covers the WebSphere, Rational, and Tivoli lines, among other products) fell 7% Y/Y in Q2.
Separately, IBM's Watson Health unit (launched in April) has announced partnerships with drugmaker Teva and healthcare R&D outsourcing firm ICON. Both tie-ups involve using the Watson Health Cloud analytics platform to derive insights from large volumes of healthcare-related data.

Update:  Some more Watson Health news: IBM has named Deborah DiSanzo, formerly the CEO of Philips Healthcare, Watson Health's general manager. Big Blue also says it's opening a Watson Health HQ in Cambridge, MA that will house 700+ employees.

Argus also expects Big Blue to see margin expansion as its sales mix shifts away from commodity offerings to higher-margin software and services tied to ""strategic imperatives"" in fields such as analytics, security, and cloud services. ""[A]t this stage IBM is still rolling off significant low-margin and slow growth business. This transition will be a negative for revenue in the near term and an upturn is still some time away. However, EPS comparisons could turn positive by the end of this year or early next year, depending on end-market conditions.""
Consensus is for EPS to drop to $15.73 this year from 2014's $16.53, before rising to $16.13 in 2016. Revenue, affected by forex, hardware/services weakness, and the x86 server unit sale, is expected to drop 10.6% in 2015 and 0.6% in 2016.
Separately, IBM has made a few cloud-related product announcements. 1) IBM's Bluemix cloud app platform (PaaS) has been updated to better support Java tools and resources. 2) Cloud management software from Blue Box (acquired earlier this year) can now be used to manage private clouds at IBM data centers. 3) IBM's Spectrum Protect backup software (competes against the likes of Symantec and CommVault) now supports direct cloud backups.

While IBM (IBM +0.1%) has supported Linux on its System z mainframes for 15 years, its new LinuxONE systems are the first mainframes to exclusively run on the open-source OS, and thus eschew IBM's proprietary z/OS.
A high-end mainframe called LinuxONE Emperor (named after the penguin) supports up to 8K virtual machines or hundreds of thousands of lightweight app containers. The less powerful LinuxONE Rockhopper (ditto) is said to be ""designed for clients and emerging markets seeking the speed, security and availability of the mainframe but in a smaller package.""
Like System z mainframes, LinuxONE supports Red Hat (RHT +0.5%) and SUSE's Linux distributions, while also adding support for Canonical's Ubuntu Linux distribution. Big Blue also promises to support a slew of open-source software tools/platforms popular with Linux users, such as MariaDB (database), Apache Spark (in-memory big data engine, an area of interest for IBM), and Docker (container platform).
Notably, IBM will offer subscription-based/pay-as-you-go pricing options for LinuxONE, as it tries to win over businesses worried about the traditional up-front costs of deploying a mainframe.
Thanks to an upgrade cycle, IBM's mainframe revenue rose 9% Y/Y in Q2 and 118% in Q1, after falling sharply in 2014. After adjusting for the highs and lows of cycles, servers based on Intel's Xeon CPUs have been gradually taking share from mainframes for years.

With a Q1 EPS beat in tow, IBM is reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $15.75-$16.50 (compares with a $15.89 consensus). Big Blue also still expects free cash flow to be flat relative to a 2014 level of $12.4B.
Forex had an 8% impact on Y/Y revenue growth, up from Q4's 4.4%. Divestments had a 4% impact.
Helping EPS beat estimates in spite of a revenue miss: 1) Gross margin rose 80 bps Y/Y to 49.3%. 2) Non-GAAP SG&A spend fell 18% Y/Y to $5B, and R&D spend fell 9% to $1.3B (forex and divestments played a role). 3) $1.2B was spent on buybacks.

He takes issue with the image of IBM as a tech dinosaur that has missed out on the cloud services boom, and observes its cloud revenue grew 60% in 2014 to $7B. Worth noting: IBM's definition of ""cloud revenue"" also covers ancillary products/services. Its ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue totaled $3B in 2014, and was on a $3.5B/year run rate at year's end.
Racanelli also highlights IBM's 2.7% dividend yield, low multiples, investments in other growth markets, and passes on upbeat remarks from two fund managers, one of whom sees the company benefiting from a server upgrade cycle - the System z mainframe line was recently refreshed.

""IBM (IBM +1.5%) does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,"" says Big Blue in response to a report it's laying off over 110K workers. ""If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements ... they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.""
IBM adds it currently has ~15K job openings worldwide, and that it ""continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace.""
Workers' union Alliance@IBM suggests taking a cautious view of the report. ""Various members of the media are picking up on Robert Cringley's assertion that 100,000 IBMers will lose their jobs next week in a massive reorg at IBM. The Alliance has no information that this is true ... But as you all know, anything can happen at IBM anymore and this is the time of year that IBM cuts jobs.""
Though IBM has carried out plenty of layoffs in recent years, 110K+ workers would be a far larger restructuring move than anything previously launched. As Hong Kong's The Standard notes, a $600M charge likely covers the layoff of several thousand workers.

The Department of Energy has awarded $325M in contracts to IBM (IBM +0.6%) to create two GPU-accelerated supercomputers declared to be at least 3x more powerful than any existing system.

Qihoo and Baidu's 91 Wireless unit remain the leaders in China's fragmented Android app store market - 91 Wireless averaged 130M downloads/day in Q2. But the near-ubiquitous reach of WeChat/QQ within China, together with Tencent's mobile gaming clout, is helping Tencent gain ground.
Separately, Tencent, which is best known for its consumer offerings, has signed an MOU with IBM to jointly sell cloud apps and related services to Chinese SMBs. Tencent's cloud services unit will host the apps, and IBM will provide consulting and IT services.

IBM's (IBM +0.5%) SoftLayer unit has been added to the list of cloud infrastructure (IaaS) providers supporting SAP's (SAP +0.7%) Hana Enterprise Cloud platform, which delivers SAP cloud apps (including the core SAP Business Suite) running on top of the company's Hana in-memory database.
SAP already offers Hana Enterprise Cloud through its own data centers. The company also supports Hana use by 3rd-party cloud app developers, both through its own Hana Cloud platform and Amazon Web Services.
An SAP exec talks up the geographic reach of IBM's data centers, and its ability to address security concerns. ""A lot of our customers are concerned about data sovereignty and privacy controls. IBM was the obvious choice to help us address that.""

In January, IBM announced plans to build 15 new data centers to expand its cloud reach. Amazon and Microsoft have also been growing their global data center footprints.
Separately, SAP has struck an OEM and managed cloud services deal with Unisys (UIS +1.1%). Unisys will offer Hana-based ""bundled data analytics solutions"" running on its Forward high-end server platform, as well as Hana-based analytics services ""hosted in a Unisys- or partner-managed data center through a pay-for-use subscription.""

The cloud-based Watson Analytics service (recently launched) is aimed not only at IBM's mainstay enterprise clients, but also SMBs worried about the costs of an in-house analytics infrastructure. ""Large companies are further along in adopting analytics, while SMBs are falling behind,"" says IBM exec John Mason.
With an official goal of putting ""powerful analytics in the hands of every business user,"" IBM has furnished Watson Analytics with a number of self-service tools that can be handled by non-technical users, and the ability to quickly integrate with popular business apps from the likes of Salesforce, Oracle, and Google.
Big Blue has also opted for a freemium pricing model: Users can do basic data analysis for free, but have to pay if they want more advanced features. IBM is aiming for its broader Watson business to produce $10B/year in sales in 10 years; it reportedly produced only $100M as of Oct. 2013.
Meanwhile, IBM's SoftLayer cloud infrastructure (IaaS) unit is intent on making further inroads with startups, a demographic that historically hasn't been an avid consumer of IBM's wares.
Though Amazon has an outsized IaaS share among startups, SoftLayer has made some progress with the help of features such as bare metal server support and free private networking between data centers. SoftLayer has especially fared well with gaming startups.

3rd-party servers based on IBM's Power architecture will hit the market in early 2015, says IBM exec Ken King. He adds the first Power systems will be aimed at cloud and high-end applications. They'll run on Big Blue's Power8 CPUs.
3rd-party Power CPUs are also expected in time. IBM first announced plans to license Power to third parties a year ago. The company's own Power server sales have been plunging amid a broader decline in UNIX and non-x86 server demand; they fell 28% Y/Y in Q2.
Early supporters for IBM's effort include Nvidia, Samsung, Micron, and most notably Google, which (like other Web giants) buys huge quantities of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs to power its servers. Power8's proponents claim big performance gains relative to Intel's x86 Xeon CPUs; individual Power8 chips can feature 12 cores and support up to 96 threads.
King says Google, known for its obsession with performance and power efficiency, could be intrigued by the fact Power can support more virtual machines than x86. As with the budding ARM server CPU market, software support will take some time.
Intel, whose server CPU unit towers over the market and is coming off a strong Q2, is trying to counter the Power/ARM threats both by rolling out new low-power Atom server CPUs, and by expanding its custom chip work for Internet clients. Upcoming products will offer more customization by placing an FPGA and a Xeon CPU in the same package.

IBM's (IBM - unchanged) Q2 hardware sales (-11% Y/Y vs. -23% in Q1,) ""delivered meaningful upside"" to Cantor's estimates, says analyst Brian White, while reiterating a Buy. Favorable comps and healthy mainframe/storage demand allowed the hardware unit to grow 39% Q/Q, or more than twice historical seasonal growth.
White also thinks IBM's Chinese revenue (-11%, hurt by NSA issues) has bottomed out. On the CC (transcript), IBM said it saw ""a pretty good sequential improvement"" in China and India, though it added other parts of Asia-Pac remained weak.
Citi's Jim Suva is less enthusiastic than White: He observes a one-time asset gain boosted EPS by $0.10, that Global Business Services outsourcing (-9%) remains weak due to price pressure and contract negotiations, and that services signings are down 33% (partly due to tough comps). He also notes mainframe growth isn't expected to continue.
Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha, meanwhile, has doubts about ""the quality"" of IBM's forecast for $20 in 2015 EPS, given ""results continue to be driven less by revenue growth and more by non-operational items.""
Some bright spots: 1) With the help of SoftLayer, IBM's ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue is now on a $2.8B run rate. That's roughly equal to 3% of total revenue. 2) Ahead of the Apple deal, ""mobile revenue"" (a nebulous term) is up over 100% YTD.

168,2013-11-18,1.0490000000000002,"Nvidia launches K40 GPU, strikes partnerships with IBM and others","

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has unveiled the Tesla K40,  a server/HPC GPU it claims is 40% more powerful than its predecessor  (the Tesla K20X) and the first product of its kind optimized for big  data/analytics and large-scale scientific use cases.
The K40, which competes against AMD's FirePro and Intel's Xeon Phi lines, comes with 12GB of memory and 2,880 GPU cores, as well as Nvidia's GPU Boost tech.
In tandem with the K40 launch, Nvidia has announced a partnership  with IBM to develop ""GPU-accelerated versions"" of IBM apps running on  Big Blue's high-end Power systems (they rely on IBM's Power  CPUs). Nvidia's CUDA programming model (allows apps to be optimized for Nvidia GPUs) will be leveraged, as will IBM's Rational software development tools.
IBM has been getting creative in its efforts to grow Power-related sales in the face of plunging demand for traditional UNIX Power servers. Three months ago, IBM announced it would license the Power architecture and related technologies to spur broader adoption, particularly among Web/cloud companies; Nvidia was one of the launch partners. More recently, the company opened up its Power-based Watson A.I. computing platform to 3rd-party developers.
Nvidia has also announced SGI, Cray, and other server vendors will offer the K40, and that the Tesla GPUs will work with Mellanox's (MLNX +1.9%) InfiniBand adapters (often used in HPC applications).
Nvidia's Tesla GPU sales have been growing quickly, helping offset PC and Tegra weakness. The chipmaker has also been targeting the server GPU space with its Grid GPUs (meant for cloud gaming and PC virtualization apps).

IBM, no stranger to issuing low-yield corporate debt, is offering 瞿750M worth of Dec. 2020 notes sporting an interest rate of just 2.75%.
With the company having just added $15B to its buyback program, there's a good chance some of the funds will be used to fund additional stock repurchases, which have been crucial to keeping EPS growth positive in the face of declining revenue.
IBM ended Q3 with $36.2B in debt, or $10.4B if one backs out its Global Financing division. Cash/equivalents totaled $10.2B.
Meanwhile, IBM has opened up its Watson supercomputer/artificial intelligence platform to 3rd-party developers. A developer toolkit and API is being provided, and Big Blue also plans to work with VCs to compel startups to write cloud-based apps for the platform. Retail, supply chain, and health management apps are already in the pipeline. (PR)
IBM is counting on Watson, which runs on its proprietary Power CPUs, to give a lift to a Power server business that saw a 38% Y/Y sales drop in Q3 thanks to nosediving UNIX server demand.

 Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) FQ1 results earlier this week highlight how major tech firms are feeling the impact of a backlash in China to Edward Snowden's revelations about U.S. spying. ""All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,"" says Jim Lewis, a China and technology expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. Cisco has been the most explicit about attributing the Snowden effect to its falling sales in China; Beijing could be specifically targeting the company due to American hostility to telecom-equipment makers Huawei Technologies and ZTE  (OTCPK:ZTCOY) over fears that their products could be used for espionage. However, Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) experience is that the ""The Snowden effect is not real,"" adding that business in China continues to grow. Other companies to suffer in the country recently include IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the reasons cited including macro-economic factors. IBM might be somewhat inured to the NSA affair, as some of its high-end products face less competition than Cisco's offerings.  ",0.8857,positive,0.8271857923497268

Americas orders -2%, EMEA -4%, Asia-Pac (hurt by emerging markets weakness) -9%. Enterprise orders +2%, commercial (SMBs) +1%, public sector -1%. Switch sales (31% of revenue) rose 3% Y/Y, while routers (17% of revenue) fell 1%. Collaboration rose 1%, and service provider video fell 14% due to set-top weakness.

 IBM's Chinese sales fell 22% Y/Y in Q3 and its hardware sales within the country dove 40%, management disclosed on the CC. The latter accounted for 5% of the 9% revenue drop seen for ""growth markets"" during Q3. A demand rebound isn't expected until after Q1 2014, as local firms wait for economic reform plans to be announced. Talking about growth market weakness in general, IBM admits only half of its challenges stem from business conditions; the rest are execution-related. ""We see a pattern...,"" said Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi in a pointed question. With IBM having seen six straight quarters of revenue declines, Sacconaghi wonders if Big Blue should model for 0% rev. growth going forward. Management gave a list of reasons why a return to growth was possible, including a healthy services backlog (+6% Y/Y in Q3 exc. forex). Power systems (UNIX server) sales plunged 38% Y/Y in Q3, worse than Q2's 25%. System x (x86 servers) fell 18%, storage hardware 11%. System z (mainframes) rose 6%, aided by an upgrade cycle.

Performance-wise, Bay Trail should be competitive with high-end ARM-based CPUs such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 and Nvidia's Tegra 4. However, some worry they'll also be competitive with Intel's more costly/higher-margin Core notebook CPUs.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has announced a slew of Chromebooks sporting Intel Haswell Core CPUs are on tap, courtesy of OEM partners such as Acer, H-P, Asus, and Toshiba. Google recently added local/offline app support to Chrome OS, a move that stands to strengthen the OS' low-end challenge to Windows.
Intel has also launched new 22nm Xeon CPUs meant for dual-CPU servers (officially given the catchy name Xeon E5 2600 v2).? Improvements over Intel's prior-gen, 32nm, Romley Xeons include support for more cores (12 vs. 8) and threads (24 vs. 16).

IBM is using Intel's latest Xeon parts in its new NeXtScale high-density server line. Like H-P with its Moonshot servers, Big Blue hopes NeXtScale will be adopted some of the Web/cloud companies increasingly opting for a do-it-yourself approach. The first NeXtScale system can pool up to 84 dual-CPU servers in a 19"" rack.
IBM is also trying to address the needs of Web/cloud companies, who generally use Intel CPUs, by licensing its Power CPU architecture.
The Xeon launch comes shortly after Intel began shipping its Avoton Atom server CPUs, which aim to head off ARM-based competition in the high-density/microserver market. Intel claims Avoton can deliver up to 6x better performance/watt than its prior-gen Centerton.

CNET observes Apple's development of a 64-bit A-series CPU (meant for iOS hardware for now) could eventually pave the way for it to use A-series parts in Macs instead of Intel CPUs. There have already been reports Apple is thinking of doing this.

Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) $415M purchase of flash storage system vendor Whiptail marks the networking giant's official entry into the storage hardware market.
Though Cisco has become a major player in the server market through its UCS line, and has had a large presence in storage networking for some time, it has been content to leave storage sales to partners such as EMC, IBM, and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), along with server/Ethernet switch rivals such as H-P and Dell.
In a blog post explaining the deal, exec Paul Perez states Cisco concluded ""UCS needed to be best-in-class at accelerating hot data layers"" (i.e. mission-critical data), and that a flash storage offering was needed to achieve this goal.
Perez declares Whiptail to offer ""the highest scalability in performance and capacity of any scale-out flash vendor on the market today,"" (rivals such as Violin Memory might beg to differ), and imagines solutions leveraging Whiptail, UCS, and Nexus switches enabling customers to load ""vast amounts of data in seconds and minutes, not hours or days,"" among other things.
Whiptail relies on a proprietary OS built from the ground up to handle flash storage, something it argues yields superior performance.
The startup's products compete directly against systems from EMC's XtremIO unit, and indirectly against other flash-based EMC products. They also compete against IBM's Texas Memory unit and NetApp's flash offerings.
The Cisco-EMC partnership has already been pressured by the software-defined networking efforts of VMware's Nicira unit, which stand to make it easier for companies to replace Cisco gear with rival/commodity hardware (if adopted). There have been reports EMC has considered further encroaching on Cisco's turf by acquiring a networking hardware firm.
