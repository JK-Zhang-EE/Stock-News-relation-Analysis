 Oilfield service companies are mostly lower after Halliburton (HAL -2.3%) Executive VP and CFO Christopher Weber said the company's Q1 earnings would be reduced by $0.10/share due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking.

 Baker Hughes' (BHGE +1.2%) stock price target is lowered to $50 from $60 by the analyst team at Cowen after sharply underperforming peers in the wake of Q4 results that included negative revisions, lack of free cash flow and continued negative headlines from GE. But the firm says that while moving its estimates ~10% lower it continues to see attractive value that could be unlocked as BHGE begins to demonstrate stronger free cash flow. Meanwhile, Cowen raises its target for Helmerich & Payne (HP +0.1%) to $60 from $50 after the stock outperformed peers following a strong FQ1 beat, as the firm revises its 2018-20 estimates 18%-37% higher on stronger U.S. Land margins.Cowen believes HP's dividend can be sustained and continues to support the stock's rich valuation, but with a lower cash balance than in prior periods, HP could be less defensive in a commodity pullback.

 A third to a half of the 440K energy sector jobs lost in the global oil industry collapse may never come back, as a combination of more efficient drilling rigs and increased automation is reducing the need for field hands, which will hamper Pres. Trump's promises for a flood of new energy sector jobs, according to a Bloomberg report. Rigs have become so much more efficient that the shale industry can use about half as many as it did at the height of the boom in 2014 to amass the same oil output; for example, Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), the world���s largest onshore driller, says it expects to cut the number of workers at each well site eventually��to about five from 20 by deploying more automated drilling rigs. Companies were too busy pumping oil and gas to worry about head count during the boom, the downturn gave them time to rethink the mix of human labor and automated machinery in the oil fields, says Evercore ISI's James West.Relevant tickers include SLB, HAL, BHI, NOV, FTI, RIG, NE, ATW, DO, RDC, ESV, HP, PTEN, SDRL.

Drilling companies will be the last to recover among the oil and gas industry when the recovery eventually arrives, Moody's says.
North American land-based drillers will be stressed through the end of next year as contracts, signed when demand for their services was higher, expire and as prices for their services remain depressed, according to the report.
The ratings agency predicts that Parker Drilling (NYSE:PKD-OLD) and Pioneer Energy Services (NYSE:PES) could breach one of their existing financial covenants by the middle of next year.
Moody's thinks the best-positioned companies through the ongoing rout are Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP) and Precision Drilling (NYSE:PDS), which have ""the most high-quality rigs, which will be the first to re-enter the market when industry conditions improve sometime after 2017.""
