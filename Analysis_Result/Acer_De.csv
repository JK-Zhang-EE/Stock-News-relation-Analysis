Thinly traded nano cap Opexa Therapeutics (OPXA) plummets��68%��premarket on robust volume in response to its announcement that a Phase 2b study, Abili-T, assessing Tcelna (imilecleucel-T) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis failed to meet the primary endpoint of a reduction in brain volume change (atrophy) nor the secondary endpoint of reduction in the rate of sustained disease progression. On the plus side, Tcelna was safe and well-tolerated.The company will continue its analysis of the data and will consider cash preservation options.Tcelna is a personalized T-cell immunotherapy that is specifically tailored to each patient's immune response profile to myelin, a white fatty substance that insulates nerve cells. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by damage to this insulation, called the myelin sheath. ",0.8406,positive,0.47904210526315794
8,2016-09-14,-9.009,Opexa longs head for the exits ahead of Roche data presentation for MS candidate ocrelizumab; shares down 22%,"
Thinly traded nano cap Opexa Therapeutics (OPXA -22.2%) slumps on more than an 8x surge in volume, albeit on turnover of only 406K shares, as investors reportedly hit the sell button over concerns that Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) multiple sclerosis (MS) candidate OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) will hit the U.S. market before Tcelna. If, indeed, this is the reason for the exodus, investors must have been asleep for some time. The FDA's action date (PDUFA) for the BLA is December 28, announced in June. Opexa has not filed its marketing application yet. Top-line data from a Phase 2b study, Abili-T, are expected in Q4.An upcoming data presentation may be the real reason for the bearish activity. On October 10, results from Roche's Phase 3 study, ORATORIO, will be presented at the 31st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis in Barcelona. The study involved patients with primary progressive MS. The study met its primary endpoint, a statistically valid reduction in the progression of clinical disability compared to placebo.The primary endpoint of Opexa's Abili-T is the percent change in brain volume at Month 24 measured by MRI. The indication is secondary progressive MS. If Roche's ocrelizumab is approved for primary progressive MS, it will be used to treat secondary progressive MS so Abili-T's top-line data need to be impressive.

Privately-held French biotech medDay Pharmaceuticals��reports results from a Phase 3 clinical trial (MS-SPI) evaluating MD1003, a pharmaceutical-grade biotin, for the treatment of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The study met its primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat population with 12.6% of patients treated with MD1003 showing an improvement in EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) or TW25 (a timed 25-foot walk) at Month 9 compared to 0% for placebo (p=0.0051).
Secondary analyses showed evidence of a decrease in the risk of disease progression. Mean EDSS scores in the treatment group between the start of treatment and Month 12 decreased (-0.03) compared to progression (+0.13) in the placebo cohort (p=0.015). Four percent of patients in the MD1003 group showed EDSS progression at Month 9 confirmed at Month 12 compared to 13% for placebo (p=0.07).

Biotin is a B-vitamin known as vitamin H or coenzyme R. It plays a key role in cell growth, the production of fatty acids and the metabolism of fats and amino acids.
The data were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Washington, DC. Full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
