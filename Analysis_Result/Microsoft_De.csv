 Videogame sales leapt 73% to an October record, with gains in all categories as a pair of heavily awaited software titles gave the holiday season a jump start. It was the seventh straight month of Y/Y gains for the sales numbers. Overall sales rose 73% to $1.545B, according to NPD Group.

And in accessories, spending on headsets and headphones doubled Y/Y (led by Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR)), while gamepad spending was up 63%, analyst Mat Piscatella notes.

        Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to continue work on U.S. military projects despite employee protests, according to a blog post from President and CLO Brad Smith.                  Key quote: “We believe that the debate about the role of the tech sector and the military in this country has sometimes missed two fundamental points. First, we believe that the people who defend our country need and deserve our support. And second, to withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in a responsible way. We are not going to withdraw from the future. In the most positive way possible, we are going to work to help shape it.”                  Smith acknowledges concerns about government use of AI and says Microsoft wants to engage in public dialog on the subject. He also says workers who feel uncomfortable working on a project can transfer to another one.                Anonymous Microsoft workers protested the company’s bid on the $10B, winner-take-all Pentagon cloud contract.

Arguing a 3% dividend yield and an expected 10% FY15-FY18 EPS CAGR spells a 13% annual return profile, Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss has upgraded Microsoft (MSFT +2.2%) to Overweight, and hiked his target by $9 to $66.
A 7% revenue CAGR is expected from FY16-FY18, fueled by Azure, server/data center products, and Office 365. EPS growth, pressured in recent years by weak PC sales and the cloud transition (has pushed out revenue recognition and led to higher investments), is seen outpacing revenue growth with the help of buybacks, cost controls, and cloud gross margin expansion. Weiss: ""Microsoft has a strong public cloud positioning, datacenter share gains, a durable Office franchise, and less risk in Windows bolsters our confidence.""
The upgrade comes ahead of Microsoft's Jan. 28 FQ2 report. Last month, Goldman upgraded to Neutral after more than two years of staying bearish.

Meanwhile, Cisco has made several security acquisitions in recent years, and appears to be up for more, but has also launched products that compete with FireEye.
Ives also thinks IBM could bid for machine/log data analytics software leader Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and business intelligence/data visualization software firm QLIK. With a $7.6B market cap and high multiples, Splunk would be a costlier acquisition than IBM's traditional fare.
HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), meanwhile, is seen as a potential suitor for both Qlik and enterprise cloud storage/file-sharing leader BOX.

""We were wrong,"" writes Goldman's Heather Bellini while upgrading Microsoft (MSFT -0.5%) to Neutral after keeping shares at Sell amid a major 2-year rally. Her target has been hiked by $12 to $57.

Bellini: ""We are increasing our out year non-GAAP EPS estimates, driven primarily by faster gross margin expansion in Office 365 and Azure. While we still believe EPS consensus for FY17 and FY18 are too high, given the ongoing successful transition to the cloud we do not see the multiple coming under pressure.""
She adds several 2016 catalysts exist: A continued successful cloud transition, gross profit dollar growth (in spite of cloud-related margin pressure), EPS growth, the diminishing of headwinds related to weak business PC sales and the Office 365 transition (pushes out Office revenue recognition), and accelerating dividend growth.

NPD estimates U.S. physical retail video game sales fell 7% Y/Y in November to $993.9M, after having dropped 3% in seasonally weaker October to $349.4M.

Hardware sales rose 11% to $1.12B after being roughly flat in October, and peripheral/interactive toy sales rose 6% to $357.7M after rising 18% in October.
Not surprisingly, Activision's (ATVI -3.2%) Call of Duty: Black Ops III  was the month's top-selling game, followed by Bethseda's Fallout 4. However, Activision's Destiny: The Taken King fell out of the top-10, after coming in at #7 last month.
Electronic Arts' (EA +1.2%) Star Wars: Battlefront, which recently saw a $20 GameStop price cut amid mixed critic and user reviews, was #3. EA also took the #4, #6, and #7 spots via Madden NFL 16, FIFA 16, and Need for Speed. Madden and FIFA were also #4 and #6 last month.
Take-Two's (TTWO -1%) NBA 2K16 dropped three spots to #5, while WWE 2K16 fell out of the top-10. Ubisoft's (OTCPK:UBSFY) Assassin's Creed: Syndicate and Just Dance 2016 were #9 and #10; neither was in the top-10 last month.

During yesterday afternoon's FQ4 earnings call (transcript), HP Enterprise (HPE +3.1%) CEO Meg Whitman disclosed Microsoft Azure (MSFT -0.5%) ""will become a preferred public cloud partner"" for HPE, through a partnership that will be detailed next week. In return, HPE will ""serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings.""
The deal comes a month after HP announced it's shutting down its public cloud services ops, rather than compete head-on with well-established players such as Amazon (the market leader), Microsoft (#2), IBM, and Google. The company, whose on-premise IT service ops have been pressured by cloud adoption - enterprise services division revenue fell 9% Y/Y in FQ4 to $5B - added it's still committed to offering private and managed cloud services.
For Microsoft, the deal gives Azure the backing of HP's still-massive enterprise sales and IT services workforces. It follows a multifaceted Azure partnership with server OS rival Red Hat. Microsoft reported Azure revenue rose over 100% Y/Y in calendar Q3, but didn't give a figure.
HPE continues trading higher after beating depressed FQ4 sales estimates with the help of positive x86 server and networking hardware growth, and reiterating its FY16 EPS guidance (while guiding FQ1 below consensus). Analyst reactions have been mixed - bulls are trumpeting a low valuation and the potential for improved execution following HP's breakup, while bears argue sales and cash flow pressures remain substantial.

Much like many other enterprise IT firms, Microsoft is looking to pair security software with human and cloud-based services (security appliance vendors also bundle hardware). ECG's offerings include security assessment, monitoring, threat-detection, and incident-response services. Meanwhile, a new Cyber Defense Operations Center will feature dedicated teams 24x7 to respond to security incidents, and is said to provide ""direct access"" to thousands of professionals within Microsoft for dealing with security threats.
The software giant has also announced it's testing Azure Security Center, a Web-based console that works with third-party hardware and software to give IT admins an overview of their company's Azure security profile, and uses analytics to detect and respond to threats. Satya Nadella states such features could also be used for on-premise security, and to protect services running on third-party clouds.
Microsoft exec Bret Arsenault: ""Microsoft’s unique insights into the threat landscape, informed by trillions of signals from billions of sources, create an intelligent security graph that we use to inform how we protect all endpoints, better detect attacks and accelerate our response.""

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) engineers have been working for about two years to fuse Android and Chrome OS, the WSJ reports. The Web giant plans to preview a unified operating system in 2016, and launch it in 2017.
A unified OS appears to mesh with new Google CEO Sundar Pichai's worldview. Pichai, who once directly oversaw Android and Chrome OS, predicted on Google's Q3 call ""mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.""
It would also be similar to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OS strategy: Windows 10 serves as a common OS for PCs and mobile devices, with the platform's Continuum technology enabling universal apps whose UIs change based on whether keyboard/mouse or touch input is being used. Apple, by contrast, continues to reiterate it has no plans to merge iOS and Mac OS; Tim Cook famously referred to such integration as being akin to combining a refrigerator and a toaster.
Possibly contributing to Google's decision: Android is far more popular than Chrome OS, claiming 1.4B active users as of September and an 82.8% Q2 smartphone unit share (per IDC), not to mention a giant developer base. By contrast, IDC estimates Chrome OS has less than 3% of the global PC market (the education market is a strong point). Thus, officially expanding Android's focus to the PC market through an OS supporting universal apps and Google Play could provide a shot in the arm for Google's PC ambitions.

232,2015-07-31,-0.165,LinkedIn sees 10.5% post-earnings drop; two firms downgrade,"

For the second quarter in a row, LinkedIn (LNKD) fell hard post-earnings. Evercore and Avondale Partners downgraded to neutral ratings, while various other firms defended the company.
Evercore's Ken Sena notes LinkedIn's 2H15 sales (officially guided above consensus) were guided down if one excluded an accounting benefit related to the Lynda.com acquisition. ""The reasons for the company’s more conservative outlook have mostly to do with limited visibility on its Marketing Solutions line, where it continues to make a transition away from higher-priced premium display to feed-based and more performance-based ads.""
Though Sena thinks the ad transition can be managed, he declares ""the combination of another FY effective guide down, a steep deceleration in the company’s 2Q sequential user growth (measured on unique visitors), and margins showing compression (with and without Lynda) leads [Evercore] to move to the sidelines on shares."" He also compared LinkedIn's ad challenges to Twitter's.
BGC's Colin Gillis, on the other hand, considers ad concerns overblown in light of the strong performance of LinkedIn's Sponsored Updates ads. ""[D]isplay advertising is approximately 3% of overall revenue, and in our view its low quality revenue ... The irony is that the marketing solutions business that contains display advertising is the only business segment that accelerated its growth in the June quarter, growing at 32% YoY compared to 24% growth in the June 2014 quarter.""
Jefferies' Brian Pitz also sees reasons to stay bullish. ""The company is still early in large market opportunities, including Sales Navigator, Lead Accelerator, Bizo and Lynda ... The company saw dramatic improvements in Sales Navigator customer satisfaction as well as higher than expected customer renewal at the higher Sales Navigator prices implemented this year.”

234,2015-07-31,-0.165,Microsoft states Windows 10 downloads top 14M; reviews largely positive,"

Over 14M copies of Windows 10 were downloaded in the first 24 hours following its July 29 launch, Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%) exec Yusuf Mehdi discloses.
As announced months ago, the OS is a free upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 users ... including those with pirated copies. Microsoft has said pirated copies will continue to be labeled non-genuine/unsupported, but some have apparently been converted to genuine copies.
Reviewers generally declare Windows 10 a major improvement over the oft-criticized Windows 8, though some recommend users wait to upgrade until lingering bugs are fixed. The Verge's Tom Warren (8.8/10) likes the revamped Start menu, Cortana/search integration, and the Xbox app (allows Xbox One games to be streamed). ""Everything about Windows 10 feels like a new approach for Microsoft ... I rarely touch my MacBook Air anymore...""
Ars Technica's Peter Bright is a fan of Windows 10's notification center, Continuum feature (allows apps to have both touch and keyboard/mouse UIs), and support for touch-friendly Metro apps on the traditional Windows desktop. He calls the new Edge browser ""tremendously promising"" on account of its speed, stability, and streamlined UI, but adds it's ""severely feature-deficient"" for the time being.
Slate's Will Oremus: ""[Windows 10] is, as of today, the most versatile and forward-looking operating system in the world. That’s because it is the first to recognize and embrace the future of computing: a world in which all your devices are just different-sized screens running the same software ... Microsoft has embraced the convergence while respecting key differences between the mobile and desktop use cases""
In tandem with the Windows 10 launch, Microsoft has rolled out touch-friendly Office Mobile apps for the OS.

A dozen publicly traded companies - AA, AAPL, MSFT, BAC, BRK.B, KO, GM, GS, GOOG, PEP, UPS and WMT - committed to support a “strong"" outcome in  Paris, and made new pledges to take a variety of steps to tackle climate  change. For example, Alcoa says it will reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 50% by 2025, and BRK plans to retire 75% of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. In addition to company-specific goals, the White House says today's announcements total at least $140B in new low-carbon investment and more than 1,600 MW of new renewable energy.

Hindlian, who launched coverage at Sell 6 weeks before LinkedIn plunged due to the guidance provided with its Q1 beat, also notes a 3% Q2 beat would still represent a 14% deceleration in growth from 2014 levels.
Cantor's Youssef Squali is out with a more positive note today, forecasting  LinkedIn's Talent Solutions ops (62% of Q1 revenue) will post 30% Y/Y growth as the business continues taking share from online job rivals.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hasn't seen any upgrades/downgrades after beating FQ4 estimates, reporting strong cloud growth and major Windows/traditional Office declines, and once more providing conservative guidance. A handful of firms have tweaked their targets.
Bernstein's Mark Moerdler (Outperform), among Microsoft's defenders, notes the commercial cloud annual run rate ($8B) rose 27% Q/Q, and that cloud margins also improved. ""We estimate that the Gross Margin for each incremental dollar of revenue, given the current mix of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS is at a minimum~70%, if not greater, with long term SaaS margins of 86%+ and Azure margins equivalent to Amazon’s at similar scale.""
Credit Suisse's Philip Winslow (Outperform): ""We believe Microsoft can return to double-digit EPS growth by (1) continued rationalization of its cost structure, (2) further divestitures/exits of non-core businesses, (3) optimization of its capital structure, (4) stabilization in Windows pricing, and (5) an accelerated shift to Office 365 ...  Furthermore, we believe that Microsoft Azure will emerge as the clear #2 market share player in public IaaS [behind Amazon] and will arise as the leader in public PaaS.”
Cowen's Tim Arcuri notes Microsoft's Devices & Consumer licensing guidance (covers Windows OEM and traditional consumer Office licensing, as well as Android royalties) implies ~9.4% Q/Q growth, which in turn points to a healthy (Windows 10-driven) rebound in PC demand. D&C licensing was down 34% Y/Y in FQ4 to $1.7B, thanks to Windows/Office declines and the end of Nokia payments.
Raymond James' Michael Turtis (Market Perform) is worried about slumping commercial on-premise software sales. ""Commercial license $10,451 million (-7%) missed consensus $10,550 million (-6%), guidance $10.5-10.6 billion on both Office and Server weakness, with Server decelerating to 5% CC from F3Q’s +13% ... Commercial license billings declined 12% y/y, below revenue decline of -7%, though some of this could be transition to cloud ... We reduced our [FY16] estimates across product categories given the broader slow down and took down our Server product estimates given persistent forex impact and, possibly, the first signs of broader cannibalization of Server by Azure cloud.""

 Videogame sales grew in June, with new physical games and hardware up 18% in the U.S. Y/Y, to $869.4M, according to NPD. That's a rebound from May's 13% decline. The industry showed growth in all three major areas: Hardware sales were $313.1M (up 8%); accessories were $210.7M (up 34%); and game software sales were very strong at $345.5M (up 21%, though against a weaker 2014 comp) by calling on the Batman. The settling-in of next-gen consoles continues, as it was the fourth month of Y/Y software increases. 
Batman: Arkham Knight (TWX -1.4%) led the software charts and became the year's second-best seller out of the gate, behind another Warner Bros. release, Mortal Kombat X.

June was Warner's month: Its other titles Lego Jurassic World, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Mortal Kombat X joined Batman in the top 10 at Nos. 3, 4 and 8 respectively. Warner's dollar sales are up 217% vs. the first half of 2014, making it the top corporate publisher this year, says NPD's Liam Callahan. In longer-term holdouts, Minecraft (NASDAQ:MSFT) came in at No. 6, Grand Theft Auto V (TTWO +4%) was No. 7, Take-Two's NBA 2K15 was No. 9 and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (NASDAQ:ATVI) No. 10. Next-gen consoles like PS4 and Xbox One led the way in hardware growth, up 15%. The PS4 (SNE +0.5%) led console sales again, the company said, as it has for every month this year except for April.

 Video game spending was up slightly Y/Y in April, gaining 3% to $595.7M, paced by a 13% increase in physical software sales, according to industry trackers NPD Group. That's apart from mixed results in hardware sales -- which were up 12% in unit terms, but declined 4% on a dollar basis to $183.9M, after a round of console price cuts. Physical software rose to $256.7M. This month, violent games took the spotlight, with ""Fatality""-friendly Mortal Kombat X (NYSE:TWX) the new game topping the chart. It was followed by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Battlefield: Hardline (NASDAQ:EA). MLB 15: The Show (NYSE:SNE), another new game, came in at the fourth spot, just ahead of Minecraft.

Following an afternoon Bloomberg report stating Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been approached by a potential acquirer, many have speculated archrival Oracle is the suitor. However, BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski (formerly with Re/code) reports Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) hasn't made such a move.
Outside of Oracle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the name that has popped up most often. The software giant (closed today with a $399B market cap) is large enough to swallow Salesforce, has relatively limited product overlap - its Dynamics CRM apps compete against Salesforce's apps, but generally with SMBs than enterprises - and has been hungry to grow its cloud exposure. It just set a target of nearly tripling its business cloud service revenue run rate by mid-2018.
Also: Microsoft and Salesforce struck an Office 365-centered partnership last year. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff showed up today at Microsoft's BUILD developer conference to trumpet the integration of additional Microsoft and Salesforce apps/services, and made a few tweets about the partnership along the way.
Salesforce closed up 11.6% today thanks to Bloomberg's report, and then rose 1% in AH trading to $75.41. Many cloud software peers also got a lift.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is aiming for a $20B/year run rate for its Commercial Cloud reporting segment by FY18 (ends June '18), says Satya Nadella at an analyst meeting (webcast) held amid the company's BUILD conference. Microsoft announced last week Commercial Cloud, a term that covers Azure cloud infrastructure/app platform services, commercial Office 365 sales, and Dynamics Online business app sales, was on a $6.3B/year run rate.
Assuming the target is hit, some of that growth will come from the migration of traditional Office and Dynamics licensees to cloud subscriptions. But Nadella promises there will be plenty of other growth as well. ""This is not a one-for-one shift. There is actually a pretty significant expansion of the value we can deliver.”
M&A, of course, could also expand the division. Bloomberg reported earlier today cloud CRM software giant Salesforce (current market cap of $47B) was approached by a potential acquirer. Much of the speculation about the rumored suitor revolves around Microsoft and Oracle.
Also: With Windows users now getting free upgrades and Microsoft increasingly looking to monetize the OS via services, the company says it will recognize Windows 10 license revenue over a 3-year period. Windows license revenue has traditionally been recognized up-front.

Furthering its efforts to win over iOS/Android developers (many of whom have been historically wary of the company), Microsoft (MSFT -0.4%) has used the first day of its 2015 BUILD developer conference to launch Islandwood and Astoria, projects that respectively allow iOS apps to be ported to Windows 10 and Android apps to run within Windows unmodified.
The efforts follow the December acquisition of HockeyApp (a provider of iOS/Android app crash analytics tools), and a promise that the next version of its core Visual Studio developer suite (Visual Studio 2015) would be ""built from the ground up with support for iOS, Android and Windows.""
Also launching: 1) Visual Studio Code, a free cross-platform code editor for writing Web/cloud apps. Microsoft has already made Visual Studio 2013 free to non-enterprise users in an attempt to win new developers. 2) Tools for presenting sites as apps, and for quickly modifying Windows apps so that they can be offered through the Windows Store.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has continued its barrage of Azure cloud service launches; its newest services are aimed at big data/analytics projects. One new service in preview mode (Azure SQL Data Warehouse) covers the building of structured data repositories, and the other (Azure Data Lake) unstructured repositories (prior analytics launches).
Microsoft states it's selling over 90K new Azure subscriptions per month, and that over 40% of its Azure revenue comes from startups and independent software firms. Synergy Research estimates Azure's revenue rose 96% Y/Y in Q1, and that its IaaS/PaaS share is around 10% (#2 behind Amazon's 29%).

According to a new filing, Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have amended the terms of their 10-year search pact to allow either party terminate their agreement at any point in time on or after Oct. 1.
Under the original deal, which began in February 2010, Yahoo could only terminate the pact if the revenue from each search failed to meet certain financial-performance benchmarks.
The two also restructured the agreement's search terms last week, stating the partnership is non-exclusive for both desktop and mobile.

Following months of talks, Yahoo (YHOO +0.2%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.4%) have restructured their search alliance (struck in 2009, lasts until 2020). Notably, Yahoo will ""now have increased flexibility to enhance the search experience on any platform, since the partnership is non-exclusive for both desktop and mobile.""
The companies previously disclosed the alliance was non-exclusive on mobile, but hadn't announced anything similar for PCs. They now only state Yahoo ""will continue to serve Bing ads and search results for a majority of its desktop search traffic.""
At the same time, Microsoft will now ""become the exclusive salesforce for ads delivered by Microsoft's Bing Ads platform."" Yahoo will continue exclusively providing the salesforce for its Gemini mobile search/native ad platform.
""Satya [Nadella] and I have worked closely together to establish a revised search agreement that allows us to enhance our user experience and innovate more in our search business,"" says Marissa Mayer, who has previously voiced disappointment about the performance of the Microsoft deal.
The deal has required Microsoft to make revenue per search (RPS) guarantees equal to a % of Google's estimated RPS. Thanks to RPS payment changes, Yahoo's search revenue (ex-TAC) was flat Y/Y in Q4, even though its search click-based revenue (excludes RPS payments) was up 18%.
The restructuring follows a deal by Yahoo to displace Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider, and comes amid reports Yahoo/Microsoft are trying to sell Apple on replacing Google as Safari's default provider (including on iOS). comScore estimates Bing had a 20.1% March U.S. PC search share, and Yahoo a 12.7% share; international shares are lower.

Microsoft has bought the startup for an undisclosed sum; the company declares the deal furthers its efforts to offer ""easy-to-use, accessible tools to extract maximum value from data – from anywhere, on any device."" Datazen's offerings complement Microsoft's cloud-based Power BI business intelligence tools.
Notably, Microsoft will be bundling Datazen's server software for free with its SQL Server database; Datazen's client apps have already been free to download.

Its display is smaller (10.8"" vs. 12""), and resolution slightly lower (1920x1280 vs. 2160x1440). In what might be the final nail in the coffin for Windows RT, the tablet runs on Windows 8.1 (free upgrade to Windows 10 later this year).
The Surface 3 weighs just 1.37 lbs. and is only 0.34"" thick (the Pro 3 is at 1.76 lbs. and 0.37""), and goes without its costlier sibling's fan. The rear and front cameras respectively have 8MP and 3.5MP resolutions vs. 5MP apiece for the Pro 3. Other features - a kickstand, optional type cover accessories, a business-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio, stereo speakers with Dolby (DLB -0.2%) audio support - are similar.
Microsoft claims 10 hours of battery life when playing video. The Surface 3 begins shipping on May 5 (pre-orders start today); Verizon and T-Mobile will sell 4G-capable models later this year. To win over consumers, Microsoft is throwing in a free year of Office 365 Personal (normally $70/year).
Following a rough start in 2012/2013, the Surface line has gained a following among businesses and consumers wanting a tablet that can double as a PC/productivity device. Microsoft's Surface revenue rose 24% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $1.1B. IDC estimates Windows devices had a 5.1% 2014 tablet unit share via 11.6M shipments.

Down AH yesterday due to the light sales guidance provided with its mixed Q4 results, Rackspace (RAX +1.4%) is now back above $50. Helping its cause: Pac Crest has upgraded to Outperform, and at least four firms have hiked their targets.
Pac Crest cites enterprise and OpenStack momentum as reasons for upgrading: ""In the second half of 2014, Rackspace won more large enterprise contracts worth at least $100,000 per month than it had in the prior five quarters combined ... management indicated that OpenStack now makes up more than 50% of its public cloud revenue, which implies OpenStack revenue is at least 15.6% of its total revenue.""
Cowen (target hiked to $75) now considers it likely Rackspace ""will announce support for a mega cloud provider in 1H15,"" thereby boosting its long-term addressable market and lowering future capex needs (in exchange for sharing revenue). It adds sales guidance was in-line after adjusting for forex, and that EBITDA margin guidance was better than expected.
Meanwhile, new CEO Taylor Rhodes argues the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market's price war is calming down. ""Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) in November, for the first time, didn’t make a price cut move ... AWS is feeling like they are the reference brand leader, that they are strong versus Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), so they don’t need to do it as much. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is cutting price, but who knows how much share they are actually taking.""
He also reiterates Rackspace's assertion that its OpenStack/hybrid cloud offerings are differentiated in the battle for enterprise accounts. ""The mainstream market has two problems: They have legacy apps that won’t go [to multi-tenant public clouds] automatically ... the second problem they have is this skills set gap ...

Full-year operating expense guidance has been cut by $1B to $33.2B-$33.6B. Another $200M worth of restructuring charges are expected over the rest of FY15 (ends June '15), yielding total charges of $1.4B. FY15 tax rate guidance is at 22%-24%; the FQ2 tax rate was 25%.
In its earnings slides (.ppt), Microsoft states its unearned revenue balance was $21.2B at the end of FQ2, +9% Y/Y but slightly below historical seasonality due to forex and the recognition of $300M worth of prior period deferrals. The contracted but not billed balance was above $24B.

Microsoft (MSFT -1.6%) has followed up on its Windows 10 reveal by unveiling new hardware. Getting the most attention is HoloLens, a headset declared to be ""the most advanced holographic computer the world has ever seen.""
The device contains a see-through display that allows users to see holograms in their real-world environments, and doesn't require a connection to a PC or phone. Microsoft has christened the augmented reality platform underpinning it Windows Holographic.
HoloLens is expected to launch around the same time as Windows 10. LCoS microdisplay vendor Himax (HIMX +5.4%), previously rumored to be working with Microsoft, has spiked higher.
Also unveiled: Surface Hub, an 84"" 4K touch display sporting dual cameras and sensors, running Windows 10, and providing quick access to Skype video calls and a digital whiteboard. The product, which presumably won't be cheap, appears to be aimed at conference rooms.
As rumored,  Microsoft's Spartan browser sports a streamlined  UI, Cortana integration, a note-taking/annotating stylus mode, and a new rendering engine that delivers improved performance. It also has a Reading Mode that formats Web pages to resemble e-books.
A slew of new universal apps (they feature similar PC and phone/tablet UIs) have been shown off. OneDrive, a photos app, and a People app are among the covered products. New Office apps for phones and small tablets have been previewed, and so has the ability to run universal Windows apps on the Xbox One.

""We think of Windows as a service,"" says Microsoft (MSFT -0.9%) OS chief Terry Myerson as he reveals Windows 10 in detail at a Redmond event. Microsoft has already suggested it will rely more on services to monetize Windows as it cuts or eliminates licensing fees for touch devices and cheaper PCs. (live blogs: The Verge, Engadget)
To drive home his claim, Myerson states Windows 10 will be provided as a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8.1 users during its first year of availability. As one would expect, Windows Phone users will also get a free upgrade for the OS, which aims to provide an integrated developer environment for PCs, phones, and tablets (albeit with different UIs).
More details have been given about Windows 10's revamped Start Menu: It can work in full-screen mode, and its tiles support live animations. Other new features shown off include an Action Center providing quick access to settings and notifications, new touch gestures, and Cortana integration.
After most businesses passed on deploying Windows 8, Microsoft reiterates Windows 10 will be very enterprise-friendly. The company showed off a variety of business and productivity-focused features at last September's Windows 10 preview event.
COO Kevin Turner has said Windows 10 will see a commercial launch in late summer or early fall. A new browser will reportedly accompany it.

While Facebook rolls out an enterprise social networking platform to test partners, LinkedIn (LNKD) says it's prepping its own tools for connecting and sharing with co-workers.
The products include a solution allowing users to send private messages (InMails) to co-workers even if they aren't connected, a product for sharing employee contact info, and an app for joining employee groups receiving specific content from an employer. However, unlike many existing business social networking solutions (as well as Facebook's), there won't be a chat service.
Though widely used for professional networking and job hunting, LinkedIn isn't relied on nearly as much for communicating with co-workers - a use case that's more likely to involve active daily/weekly engagement. Boosting low engagement rates has been a LinkedIn priority for some time.

Facebook at Work, first reported on by the FT in November, has been made available via app stores to select enterprise test partners. The platform looks a lot like standard Facebook (FB +0.4%) - it contains a news feed, messaging tools, and groups - and lets users log in with their regular Facebook accounts. But a user's professional data is completely split off from his/her personal data, and Facebook won't collect any of it.
Moreover, unlike LinkedIn (LNKD +0.1%), Facebook at Work is only focused (for now) on connecting with co-workers, thus arguably making it more of a rival to Jive Software (JIVE -0.3%), Salesforce's Chatter platform, and Microsoft's Yammer. LinkedIn and Jive both sold off following the November FT report.
With no ads being sold, corporate subscriptions are a potential revenue stream. Facebook can count on its giant, highly engaged user base to drive interest in Work. At the same time, it has to contend with corporate wariness towards Facebook, historically viewed by many of them as a productivity-killer.
Separately, Oppenheimer and Credit Suisse have respectively hiked their Facebook targets to $100 and $102. Oppenheimer expects a strong Q4 report on Jan. 28. ""Checks suggest 4Q pricing +14% q/q and +21% y/y, with same-client spending +32% q/q and 33% y/y ... Organic reach is becoming more difficult, due to competition for newsfeed impressions ...

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 2.4% Y/Y in Q4 to 80.8M - a bigger decline than Q3 and Q2's 1.7%, but better than expectations for a 4.8% drop. Gartner is more positive, estimating shipments rose 1% to 83.7M.
Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win. XP support) has slowed, and that ""market progress has been fueled by low-priced systems, including growth of Chromebooks and [Microsoft's] promotion of Windows 8 + Bing.""
On the bright side, both IDC and Gartner report Asia-Pac returned to positive growth, and that broader consumer demand is gradually improving. The U.S. consumer market is expected to return to positive growth in 2015, aided by slowing tablet demand and the Windows 10 launch.
IDC believes all top-5 vendors gained share from rivals with less scale. A quarter after cracking the top-5 for the first time with a 6.3% share, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) unit share is believed to have risen to 7.1% (+130 bps Y/Y) on the back of 4.9M shipments (+18.9%). Given higher ASPs, revenue share might be around 15%.

Apple, which naturally views Google as a major rival, already dropped Google as iOS and Mac OS' Spotlight search provider this year in favor of Bing. Yahoo, meanwhile, is less than a week removed from announcing it has displaced Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider; Google is still the default provider in Europe.
The Firefox deal suggests Google is willing to walk away from default search agreements if Yahoo/Microsoft (hungry to grow their scale) significantly undercut its revenue-sharing terms, betting much of its base will keep using Google regardless. Macquarie has estimated Google provides Apple with a 75% cut on Safari-driven iOS search ad revenue.
On iOS, users could keep relying on Google search in the event of a Yahoo deal by manually selecting Google as their Safari search option (should Yahoo become the default), or by using Google's popular search and Chrome apps. StatCounter estimates Google had a 92.2% October mobile/tablet search share to Yahoo and Bing's combined 6.5%.

Among those positing a more aggressive move was Citi's Walter Pritchard, who saw a boost of maybe 25% along with targeting a payout ratio of around 70% for the fiscal year ending next June.

Following the release of Windows 9 (codenamed Threshold, expected in spring 2015), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to do away with its traditional approach of launching major Windows releases every few years in favor of ""regular, incremental updates,"" ZDNet's Mary-Jo Foley reports.
A similar update schedule will exist for Windows Phone, set to merge with the flatlining Windows RT and act as a joint phone/tablet platform. Among other things, Satya Nadella's July memo promised Microsoft plans to ""streamline [its] engineering process and reduce the amount of time and energy it takes to get things done.""
Foley doesn't know if Microsoft will keep charging upgrade fees (perhaps through a subscription), or follow Apple's lead in making its PC OS updates free. Microsoft recently removed license fees for sub-9"" Windows hardware.
The technical preview for Windows 9/Threshold is expected in late September or early October. All signs suggest the OS will feature the return of the Start menu, along with the ability to show Metro-style live tiles in desktop mode.
Foley's latest scoop comes as Bloomberg reports Apple is working on a 12.9"" iPad, a device that could be positioned as more of a laptop replacement than the 9.7"" and 7.9"" models.

Four months after Nokia launched 3 low-end Android phones (the Nokia X, X+, and XL), Microsoft (MSFT -0.5%) has launched the €99 ($135) X2. The device sports a 4.3"" display (bigger than the X's 4"" display) to go with 1GB of RAM and a dual-core, 1.2GHz., CPU.
Like the prior models, the X2 doesn't run on Google's version of Android, and thus lack the apps/services normally bundled with it (Play, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Now). Microsoft and Nokia's apps/services take their place.
Nonetheless, the phones allow Microsoft to sell devices that can leverage much of Android's app ecosystem (still far larger than Windows Phone's) as it battles with Google and its OEM partners for prepaid/emerging markets buyers.
PC Magazine's Sascha Segan isn't convinced Microsoft is committed to Android long-term, especially since the price delta between the X line and low-end Windows Phones is about to dissipate. ""Phone development cycles are still well over a year ... there were plenty of sunk costs, and the really low-cost Windows phones aren't ready yet.

 Nokia (NOK -0.4%) says it is considering its options after India's Supreme Court rejected its appeal against a demand for a multimillion-dollar payment before it transfers a mobile phone plant and other assets in the country to Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%). The ruling upholds a lower court verdict ordering NOK to pay a 35B rupee ($572.5M) guarantee after local authorities blocked the factory's transfer in a tax dispute; as a result, the factory - a critical part of the smartphone business MSFT is purchasing - remains shut. If the Indian manufacturing plant is not transferred to MSFT, it could mean less money for NOK from the deal; NOK could run it as a contractor to MSFT but not for long, the company has said in court hearings.

Intel's (INTC -3.6%) partial blaming of weaker-than-expected Q4 server CPU division sales (revenue +8% Y/Y, but volumes only +1% Y/Y and -3% Q/Q) on a government shutdown comes across as a ""bad excuse,"" thinks FBR.
Though reiterating an Outperform, FBR is skeptical about Intel's long-term 15% revenue CAGR target for its server CPU division. Bernstein questioned the division's growth outlook yesterday afternoon.

Goldman, reiterating a Sell (previous), says Intel's numbers ""confirm our view that there is downside, not upside, to Intel's 2014 EPS."" It's worried about both server CPU sales and a softening corporate PC upgrade cycle (driven by the Windows 7 transition) following Q1.

JPMorgan, which upgraded Intel going into earnings, is defending the company. It's pleased with stabilizing PC demand and dismisses server concerns, given sales have historically been volatile.
A major headwind faced by Intel's server CPU unit: Server industry revenues have been steadily declining, as demand shifts towards Web/cloud service providers with bigger economies of scale and a penchant for using cheap white-label hardware. IDC estimates total server sales fell 3.7% Y/Y in Q3, and that x86 server sales rose just 2.8%.
Microsoft (MSFT -1.6%) and AMD (AMD -1.1%) are ticking lower following Intel's report. So are server virtualization kingpin VMware (VMW -1.9%), parent EMC (EMC -0.9%), and rival Citrix (CTXS -0.8%). Intel suggested on its CC virtualization growth is softening.

348,2013-12-11,-0.44,Microsoft reportedly thinking of offering Windows Phone/RT for free,"

Fresh off writing about a Nokia Android phone project, The Verge reports Microsoft (MSFT -1.6%) is thinking of eliminating licensing fees for Windows Phone and RT, and focusing on monetizing the platforms via ads and services subscriptions.
In practice, such a move would make it cheaper to license Windows Phone than Android (NASDAQ:GOOG), given Microsoft collects significant Android royalties from top OEMs.
Though Windows Phone has achieved a double-digit smartphone unit share in certain European and emerging markets, IDC estimates the OS only had a 3.6% global share in Q3, thanks in large part to small U.S. and Chinese shares. With regards to the latter, it's worth noting Microsoft doesn't collect royalties on a large portion of Chinese Android shipments, particularly those form white-label OEMs.
RT, meanwhile, has fallen flat since its 2012 launch. PC OEMs have largely abandoned the ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) OS, which may be merged with Windows Phone down the line, to focus on building Windows 8 and Android tablets.

Eight days after Sony (NYSE:SNE) announced it had sold 2.1M+ PlayStation 4 units since its Nov. 15 launch, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) says it has sold 2M+ Xbox One units since its Nov. 22 launch.
A spokesman says the One, whose $499 price tag had worried some observers, is selling at a faster clip than the Xbox 360 did following its launch, and is sold out at most retail locations.

Nomura had previously suggested 3M-4M 2013 One sales were likely; Microsoft's latest figure suggests it's on its way to hitting that range. The firm had also cautioned the Xbox unit could lose over $1B in 2013 after accounting for all expenses.
CPU/GPU supplier AMD has been estimated to receive $110 per One shipment.
Separately, AllThingsD has followed up on The Verge's report about a Nokia low-end/custom Android phone by stating ""there is a sense"" within Nokia that Microsoft ""may be willing to pursue the project.""
A Nokia source states the phone's software ""has a look more similar to Windows Phone than to the 'squircle' icons used on the Asha,"" and would deliver Microsoft services (Bing, Skype, etc.). The latter may be a necessity, given Google won't allow its own services to be provided with a ""forked"" version of Android.

Multiple sources tell The Verge Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) phone unit has been working on a low-end Android phone even as the business gets set to be sold to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). A 2014 launch is said to be planned.
The phone, codenamed Normandy, reportedly features (like Amazon's Kindle Fire line) a non-Google-approved version of Android. That means it can't feature Google Play, or commonly pre-installed Google apps/services such as YouTube, Maps, Gmail, and Now. Sources compare the product to Nokia's Asha feature phones.
The NYT previously reported Nokia worked on Android phones before the Microsoft deal was announced. However, the deal prohibits Nokia from selling phones under the Nokia brand until 2016. Moreover, maintaining a phone business, and the patent cross-licenses needed for it, could undercut Nokia's efforts to better monetize its IP.
Thus, Microsoft will probably have the final call on whether to sell the phone. Thanks in large part to the Lumia 520 and variants, Windows Phone has made decent gains in the low-end smartphone market. But it hasn't yet reached the unsubsidized price points (well below $100) delivered by the cheapest Android phones. In the meantime, those Android phones are eating into Nokia's feature phone business.

The report comes a few days after Microsoft announced it sold 1M One units in the console's first 24 hours of availability, and a day after Nomura predicted the Xbox division will likely lose over $1B in 2013, after factoring expenses such as marketing and R&D. Today, Janney estimates One shipments could hit 6M by March 31.

Former Microsoft workers have criticized the system for creating a work environment in which good employees occasionally received bad reviews, and in which workers felt as if they were competing with each other.
In an internal memo discussing the change, HR chief Lisa Brummel says Microsoft will now place a greater emphasis on ""teamwork and collaboration"" when reviewing employee performance, and will no longer have a ""a pre-determined targeted distribution"" for determining employee rewards.

Though Nomura's Rick Sherlund (Buy, $40 PT) is willing to give Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ""the benefit of the doubt"" for its targets of 50M Windows Phone sales and $600M/year in cost savings for Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) phone unit in FY15 (ends June '15), he nonetheless sees the division diluting Microsoft's FY14 EPS by $0.08, and its FY15 EPS by $0.06.
The reason? Sherlund expects the Nokia unit's feature phone sales, already nosediving, to drop 32% in FY14 to $6.8B, and 29% in FY15 to $4.9B. That more than offsets an expected 43% increase in smartphone sales (now entirely Windows Phone) from FY13 to FY15, to $8.4B. Thus, in spite of cost cuts, Sherlund sees the business posting a $630M FY15 op. loss, and a -5% op. margin.
The Nokia unit is coming off a quarter where it posted a $47M op. loss, a -1.6% op. margin, and a 19% Y/Y drop in revenue to €2.9B ($3.9B). Windows Phone (Lumia) volumes jumped to 8.8M units from 7.4M and 2.9M a year earlier, but their were sold at an ASP of just €143 ($194, -8% Q/Q), thanks to a mix shift towards sales of Lumia 520 and other cheaper models.

Sena believes total U.S. minutes spent on LinkedIn rose 51% Y/Y in July, soundly outpacing user growth of 39%. Moreover, in spite of the mobile shift, global PC minutes/user rose 18% and 16% Y/Y in Aug. and July, respectively.
Mobile engagement is believed to have risen 5% Y/Y in July, with U.S. unique visitors doubling to 18M.
LinkedIn has rolled out a slew of new features over the last 18 months in an effort to boost engagement rates that remain well below Facebook and Twitter's. The company has also bought popular mobile reader app Pulse.
In August, Sena praised the strong engagement/traffic numbers released in tandem with LinkedIn's Q2 report. His 2014 revenue estimate now stands at $2.39B, well above a $2.13B consensus.
Shares are only 3% below their all-time high of $257.56.

The new RT tablet, simply known as Surface 2 (MSFT +0.1%), offers a better display than the Surface RT (1080p vs. 1366x768) to go with a revamped kickstand, improved battery life (Microsoft promises a 25% gain), and Nvidia (NVDA -1.4%) Tegra 4 CPU (the RT used a Tegra 3). (live blog) (details)
Revamped Touch Cover and Type Cover accessories are also being shown off. The new Touch Cover has 1,092 sensors, whereas the original only had 80.
The Surface 2 will start at a high-end price point of $449; though demand for ~$200 Android tablets has taken off, companies other than Apple have largely had a rough time competing in the high-end. The Surface Pro 2, which is more of a PC/tablet convertible than a standard tablet, starts at $899.
PC OEMs have been abandoning the RT tablet market, as the ARM-based platform struggles with weak demand and a dearth of developer support relative to iOS/Android.
Microsoft announced today there are now 100K apps in the Windows Store, up from 10K a year ago. The Windows Store covers both Window 8 and RT apps.

After meeting with Google Glass (GOOG) LCOS microdisplay supplier Himax (HIMX +5.3%), Chardan's Jay Srivatsa reports Google has prompted Himax to ramp production, and thinks Glass will see a full commercial launch in Q1 2014. He adds Google might launch more than one Glass model, to cater to those needing prescription glasses.
Srivasta believes Himax has already raised microdisplay production to 500K units/month from a prior 200K/month, and is set to produce 850K/month by the end of Q1.
Pricing for a commercial version of Glass remains a mystery. The developer edition was sold earlier this year for $1,500. Google has said it doesn't plan to run ads on Glass, and wants to profit from hardware sales.
Himax also told Srivasta it's in the ""early stages of ramping [microdisplay] production for another company,"" which the analyst believes is Microsoft (MSFT -2.5%). Himax thinks the company's product could launch in mid-2014.
Meanwhile, TechCrunch reports Microsoft might spend up to $200M to buy wearable computing patents and assets from military contractor Osterhout Design. Osterhout has worked on head-mounted displays in the past, among many other products.

Yesterday, Oppenheimer reported Himax is seeing ""significant"" interest in its microdisplays from other firms in the wake of the Google deal. Himax shares are making new highs again today.

Microsoft attributes the spending ramp to cloud services (Azure, Xbox Live, Office 365) needs. The firm is, however, pleased with the rapid FY13 growth reported for Office 365 seats (+350%), Azure (+200%), and cloud CRM software (+80%).

Leaked builds of Windows Phone 8.1 (Blue) indicate Microsoft (MSFT -0.2%) is working on a Siri-like voice assistant service codenamed Cortana (the name of an AI character in Halo).
ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley reports Cortana won't just be a voice-command feature for Windows Phones, but will be ""core to the makeover of the entire ""shell"" -- the core services and experience -- of the future versions of Windows Phone, Windows and the Xbox One operating systems.""
She adds Steve Ballmer has hinted at such a service, talking of a personalized UI that ""learns more and more over time about people and the world ... and will be great at responding seamlessly to what people ask for, and even anticipating what they need.""
Though Microsoft has some catching up to do against both Siri and Google Now, the company can leverage the huge R&D investments it has made over the years in voice-recognition and AI tech. Of course, Google is also investing heavily in those areas.
Cortana could end up being a negative for Nuance (NUAN -2.4%), whose own R&D efforts have shifted towards natural-language processing and assistant services relative to basic voice recognition. But much depends on how widely it's deployed/adopted.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are moving to sue the U.S. government for the right to release more information on the companies' involvement in NSA surveillance programs. Microsoft's outspoken General Counsel Brad Smith wrote today that, with negotiations with the NSA having broken down, Microsoft will move forward ""in the hope that the courts will uphold our right to speak more freely."" A Google spokesperson: ""there is still too much secrecy around these requests.""

The Guardian reported last week that the NSA had ""paid millions of dollars to cover the [PRISM compliance] costs of major internet companies."" The tempest of public attention escalated yesterday, after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government will pay $278M during the fiscal year to telecommunications firms for clandestine access to their networks.
At stake is consumer perception (and business) of what degree of privacy can be expected from the services provided by tech companies. Microsoft, Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), AOL, Twitter, and Reddit have all moved to distance themselves from the NSA scandal.

Bloomberg's projection of a $0.03 hike to $0.26 takes into account data such as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) ability to pay and the payout implied in the options market. The current consensus forecast is for the quarterly dividend to be hiked $0.02 to $0.25.
The company needs to balance the need to keep payouts somewhat inline with increases in operating income (so as not to incur tax on cash held overseas), but not so low as to draw the ire of activist investors like ValueAct.
""Microsoft has a target on its back,"" says analyst Kim Caughey-Forest, adding that any cash-heavy tech company is paying close attention and considering bigger dividends ... no matter where their cash is domiciled. ""The activist investor has really come into play in the last 18 months, and not just at Microsoft.""
A $0.26 quarterly dividend at Microsoft would work out to an annualized yield of 3.1% based on last night's close. The company typically announces its new dividend policy in September.

Remarks in Ballmer's departure memo about originally wanting to leave in the middle of Microsoft's ""transformation to a devices and services company"" had already spurred internal chatter about a forced exit, as did the fact Ballmer never thanked Gates.

Ballmer mentioned in a Friday ZDNet interview he began talking to potential replacements 3-4 years ago. But he has also previously suggested he wouldn't step down until the 2017-2018 timeframe.
This is the second time in a year Swisher has reported Gates backed the departure of a senior Microsoft exec. Last November, she reported Gates (and Ballmer) supported removing long-time Windows chief Steven Sinofsky.

In tandem with the launch, LinkedIn is lowering its minimum U.S. registration age to 14 from 18. Some other countries already have minimum ages as low as 13.
