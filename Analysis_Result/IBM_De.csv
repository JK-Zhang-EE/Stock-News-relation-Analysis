Cantor Fitzgerald stuck with a Neutral rating and $152 target, saying margins are still an open question and it sees ""a return to consistent organic growth and margin expansion as necessary for sustainable multiple expansion from present levels."" Without a big tax benefit, IBM might have missed estimates, BMO's Keith Bachman says. The company has ""some work to do"" and BMO's staying on the sideline (price target $175) until there's better confidence of margin improvement.

With the help of ""security experts, cryptographers, hardware experts and researchers,"" IBM (IBM -0.8%) says it has created a slew of cloud services meant to enable secure blockchain networks, along with cloud apps leveraging them. Financial services, healthcare, and government clients are among the firms being targeted.
BNY Mellon is an initial user of the service - the bank plans to create ""a unique application for securities lending, using a blockchain network to trade and transfer assets."" IBM promises its cloud platform will ""allow production blockchain networks to be deployed in minutes,"" while supporting Docker containers (alternatives to server virtual machines that run on Linux and feature little overhead), data dashboards, and analytics tools.
While the hype surrounding Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) has cooled some, corporate interest in the blockchain - the distributed/encrypted ledger technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - for enabling cheap and secure transactions remains high. JPMorgan, Goldman, and other i-banks unveiled plans last year to create standards for using blockchain in the financial industry. In March 2015, Reuters reported IBM has held informal talks with central banks about creating a system for enabling blockchain-based transactions that don't require a bank or payment processor.
IBM exec Jerry Cuomo: ""We love blockchain technology because it holds the promise of supporting a very wide variety of industries ... But if you are building a blockhchain that deals with health records or shipping logistics, financial data, or any reference data about products, there are rules regulatory rules and security you have to address."" He asserts IBM's solution was designed with those security/compliance issues in mind.
Online retailer Overstock (OSTK -2.1%) has also been making big blockchain investments; it's eight months removed from buying financial order-routing firm SpeedRoute to provide an infrastructure for its t0 blockchain software.

At its GCP Next 2016 cloud user conference, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has unveiled a Cloud Speech API that provides voice recognition services for third-party apps.
The API supports 80+ languages, and can work in either real-time streaming and batch mode. Notably, Google (has made huge A.I./machine learning investments) says the API will rely on the same neural network powering voice search used by Google's search and keyboard apps. It will initially be free to use; Google plans to eventually charge, while offering low-cost pricing tiers.

Citing higher deal risk and weakening NAND fundamentals, CLSA's Mark Heller has downgraded SanDisk (SNDK -1.6%) to Underperform, and cut his target by $16 to $70.
Heller doesn't think weakening fundamentals will unravel Western Digital's (WDC -2.2%) pending cash/stock acquisition of SanDisk, but is worried about the potential for Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary Unispendour to walk away from its deal to buy a 15% stake in Western for $92.50/share (107% above Western's Friday close).
If Unisplendour was to walk away, Heller sees Western shareholders deciding on the SanDisk deal. The deal calls for Western to pay $85.10 in cash and issue 0.0176 shares for each SanDisk share provided the Unisplendour investment has closed prior to the acquisition. If it hasn't, the cash payout drops to $67.50, and the stock payout rises to 0.2387 shares. SanDisk currently trades below $67; deal closing has been forecast to occur in calendar Q3.
Separately, Western has announced the purchase of over 100 IBM ""patent assets"" related to distributed storage, object storage, and non-volatile memory, as well as a cross-licensing deal with the IT giant; terms are undisclosed.

IBM is nearing a ""big move to improve its ties"" with machine/log data analytics software leader Splunk (SPLK +2.6%), reports Northland Securities' Tim Klassell. He sees such a deal providing a ""nice tailwind"" for Splunk's efforts to win larger deals.

Regardless, Big Blue's ""business analytics"" revenue (covered a variety of analytics-related hardware, software, and services sales) totaled $17.9B in 2015 (up 7% Y/Y), and the company could provide Splunk with a massive army of sales, consulting, and IT personnel to sell and deploy the company's offerings.

Three months ago, IBM (IBM -4.6%) fell towards $140 after providing a 2015 EPS guidance cut to go with mixed Q3 results. Today, shares are almost $20 lower as markets react to the light 2016 guidance - EPS of ""at least"" $13.50, free cash flow of ~$11B-$12B vs. 2015's $13.1B - issued with Big Blue's slight Q4 beat. The S&P is down 0.5%, and the Nasdaq up 0.5%.
Plenty of analyst have (unsurprisingly) cut their targets, but none have downgraded. Aside from forex pressures (expected to hurt 2016 EPS by over $1 as hedges roll off), plenty of concerns have been voiced about IBM's software ops, which were responsible for 46% of the company's 2015 segment op. profit ($9.1B out of $19.7B) and have been hurt by weak deal activity among top-250 clients.
Jefferies' James Kisner (Underperform, $110 target) argues IBM still faces a tough transition as on-premise software and IT services demand continues to be pressured by SaaS/cloud adoption. He also estimates Q4 EPS would've been $4.54 (below a $4.81 consensus) if not for a lower tax rate, and states services signings of $16.7B fell short of a $19.1B consensus.
RBC's Amit Daryanani (Neutral, $135 target): ""Based on tepid EPS/[free cash flow] guide and continued software declines, and System-Z entering the end of the mainframe cycle, we continue to stand on the sidelines."" Drexel Hamilton's Brian White (Buy, $160 target) remains bullish, calling EPS guidance conservative and talking up IBM's 4.1% dividend yield.
Separately, Fortune reports IBM is in advanced talks to buy Ustream, a provider of live video streaming, transcoding, and delivery services for businesses, for $130M in cash + possible earn-out/retention payments.

IBM (IBM -5.8%) is at its lowest levels since 2010 after providing a 2015 EPS guidance cut to go with mixed Q3 results, and reporting continued top-line pressures in many key businesses. A slew of firms have cut their targets, but none have downgraded.
On the earnings call (transcript), CFO Martin Schroeter stated Q3 sales were pressured by a longer-than-expected ""transformation"" timeframe for Global Business Services (GBS) ""as the market shifts away from some of the more traditional application areas"" (due to cloud adoption?), as well as weak storage demand amid growing industry adoption of flash arrays - that's potentially a positive for newly-public flash array vendor/IBM rival Pure Storage (PSTG +2.4%).
Schroeter also mentioned transactional software revenue weakened towards the end of Q3, and that both GBS and transactional challenges will weigh on Q4. GBS revenue fell 13% Y/Y in Q3, storage revenue 19%, and software revenue 10%. Excluding forex, the declines were 5%, 14%, and 3% (suggestive of moderate share loss). Software accounted for 43% of IBM's Q3 op. profit.
Stifel's David Grossman (Buy, target cut by $20 to $160): ""We wonder whether the significant downward revision to guidance reflects an attempt to reset the bar for next year ... We have lowered our 2015 EPS from $15.71 to $14.75 (consensus was $15.67) and 2016 from $16.36 to $15.30 (consensus $16.04), which assumes flattish revenue growth in 2016 (versus down ~1% in 2015) and pretax margin expansion of 60bp (versus down 100bp in 2015). It will be difficult to grow [free cash flow] in 2016 on this EPS base, which suggests the stock could remain in a trading range of high $135-$145, pending the 4Q report.""
Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi (Market Perform, target cut by $10 to $140) thinks 2016 could be even tougher than 2015, given a declining services backlog, the rolloff of currency hedges, a lack of a mainframe/Power system upgrade cycle, lower ""non-operating gains,"" and ongoing strategic investments. He sees EPS dropping to $14.30 in 2016 - revised 2015 guidance is at $14.75-$15.75 - with cash flow ""potentially declining more moderately than EPS.""

""The planned acquisition of Meteorix can make IBM one of the leading, most qualified and experienced Workday service providers in the world,"" says an IBM exec. Workday, which has been taking share from on-premise software alternatives, has an FY16 (ends in January) revenue consensus of $1.16B, and an FY17 consensus of $1.59B.

With IBM's Q2 EPS benefiting from a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.2% (down 280 bps Q/Q and 330 bps Y/Y), many firms are cutting their full-year EPS estimates on account of Big Blue's top-line pressures. However, no downgrades have arrived.
Janney's Joseph Foresi (Neutral): ""Strategic-Imperative revenue growing more than 30% y/y was impressive, but implies a worse than expected performance in the legacy business. Most segments were close to flat in either direction, and we see little prospect of overall y/y growth until 2016."" Likewise, Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold) continues to forecast ""secular challenges related to the shift to the cloud to be a negative headwind for IBM and [expects] near-term growth to be difficult.??
JPMorgan's Tien-tsin Huang (Neutral) is worried about services margins. ""[Services] signings were up nicely; backlog was up 1% (first increase since end of 2013), as IBM encouragingly won 22 large deals. However, services pretax margins deteriorated 390 basis points year/year ... Given forex is essentially neutral to margin % on pretax basis, we attribute much of this margin deterioration to need for investments in Strategic Imperatives which should continue and hurt near term Services margins.""
Stifel's David Grossman (Buy) makes a bull case centered around low multiples, services backlog conversion, and a software business believed to be faring better than generally believed. ""IBM is trading at 13 times 2015 free cash flow, which includes $0.80/share of forex-related headwinds and represents a 25% discount to the S&P earnings multiple. In our view, this stock offers attractive risk/reward given the various headwinds.""
On the CC (transcript), CFO Martin Schroeter stated IBM's mobile-related sales (benefiting from the Apple partnership?) quadrupled in 1H15, and that demand for scale-out systems is giving a lift to Power server sales (weak in recent years, but down only 1% in Q2). 25% and 16% Y/Y drops in Chinese and Brazilian revenue hurt BRIC revenue in Q2, and a fresh $200M ""workforce rebalancing"" charge was taken.

Nearly 5 months after announcing an enterprise analytics alliance with Twitter (TWTR +1.4%), IBM (IBM -0.1%) has launched a slew of cloud-based services for enterprises and developers looking to mine Twitter data for insights and/or fuse it with other data sources.
Among other things, IBM has rolled out a service on its Bluemix cloud app platform that lets developers/businesses ""search, quickly explore and then mine enriched Twitter content and aggregated insights,"" and a service for its Watson Analytics platform that can ""give business professionals the ability to immediately pull Twitter data into any project in order to help identify and explain hidden patterns and relationships.""
Also: The cloud-based version of IBM's BigInsights software for the popular Hadoop big data framework can now be obtained with ""pre-configured access to Twitter content."" IBM claims 4K+ professionals have been trained to work with Twitter data and combine it with other sources.
Sample use cases include correlating angry Tweets with weather events and customer defections for telecom companies, drawing a link between retail employee turnover and lost customers, and using Tweet sentiment to better gauge fashion demand. IDC's David Schubmehl argues IBM's industry-specific expertise (also a reason why Apple partnered with IBM) gives it an edge in such use cases, as it battles against Oracle, Salesforce, and other software vendors providing social media analytics tools.
For Twitter, IBM's tools burnish the company's credentials as a source for valuable business data, and could provide a boost to its data licensing sales. Twitter's data licensing/other revenue rose 105% Y/Y in Q4 to $47M (10% of total revenue).

To help achieve the goal, Big Blue plans to shift another $4B in spending in 2015 towards the businesses in question; the company is just a week removed from committing $1B over the next 5 years to storage software investments. Nonetheless, the size of the 2018 target suggests major new acquisitions are a possibility.
Of note: IBM often has very broad definitions of what it considers to be revenue attached to a growth business. For example, ""cloud"" revenue might not just cover cloud software and infrastructure services, but also sales of servers, databases, IT services, etc. that went towards a cloud deployment. Thus, while IBM's 2014 ""cloud revenue"" totaled $7B, its ""cloud delivered as a service revenue"" was only $3B.
IBM is also reiterating guidance (provided with its Jan. 20 Q4 report) for 2015 EPS of $15.75-$16.50, and for free cash flow to be ""consistent"" with a 2014 level of $12.37B.

With customers waiting for a new model, System z sales fell 35%. Hardware sales, of course, drive a sizable amount of software/services revenue.
Though IBM's mainframe line still claims a large enterprise/government base that swears by its scalability, reliability, and partitioning features, x86 servers have been steadily gaining ground against proprietary platforms. HP recently launched x86 hardware for its rival Superdome and NonStop server lines, and age-old mainframe competitor Unisys (NYSE:UIS) is embracing x86 as well.

Jefferies, Deutsche, and Stifel have slashed their 2015 IBM (IBM -1.9%) estimates. Shares are underperforming on a down day for equities.
Jefferies' James Kisner (Underperform) has cut his 2015 revenue and EPS estimates to $87B and $15.85 from $89.75B and $16.30, while citing a strong dollar. His Q4 estimates have been cut to $24.6B and $5.27, below a consensus of $24.93B and $5.48.
""We believe revenue growth will be significantly challenged for IBM over the next few years,"" says Deutsche's Sherri Scribner, cutting her 2015 EPS estimate by $0.40 to $15.90. She notes cloud revenue (on a $3B/year run rate) is only ~3% of total sales, and that? free cash flow has trailed GAAP EPS during the last three years (previous).
Stifel's David Grossman has cut his 2015 EPS estimate all the way to $15.17, but maintains a Buy. ""Headwinds from the hardware business should abate as 2015 progresses and product issues are being addressed; the cyclical issues are harder to predict, but comparisons get much easier in 2015, particularly in the second half.""
The estimate cuts follow a report from The Register stating CEO Ginny Rometty is planning a major reorg ""that will see IBM try to shed the dusty hardware, software and services silo structure."" Microsoft did something similar in 2013.
IBM's main post-reorg units will reportedly ""include Research, Sales & Delivery, Systems, Global Technology Services, Cloud, Watson, Security, Commerce, [and] Analytics."" Such an approach would allow Big Blue to more easily break out the performance of faster-growing businesses (cloud, Watson, security, etc.) from slower-growing ones.

After badly missing Q3 EPS estimates (in spite of backing out the losses of its soon-to-be-sold chip unit), IBM (IBM -6.7%) guided on its Q3 CC for 2014 EPS from continuing ops. to be down 2%-4% Y/Y. That implies a range of $15.97-$16.30, soundly below a $17.87 consensus.
Big Blue also says it took a $3.3B Q3 post-tax charge related to the chip business; the figure includes the $1.5B payment to Globalfoundries.
During a CNBC interview, CEO Ginny Rometty suggested fresh layoffs are on tap. The company recorded a $1B workforce rebalancing charge back in Q1; its headcount was at 431K at the end of 2013.
IBM's closely-watched services backlog fell 7% Y/Y in Q3 to $128B, a much sharper drop than Q2's 1%; the company declares it saw ""insufficient"" services productivity. Also worrying investors: Gross margin fell 90 bps to 49.2%, ending a long string of Y/Y gains.
Other pressures on EPS: 1) The non-GAAP tax rate rose 80 bps Q/Q and 320 bps Y/Y to 20.8%. 2) Buybacks fell to $1.7B from Q2's $3.7B. 3) Opex for continuing ops rose 2% Y/Y, while revenue from continuing ops fell 4% (helps explain the job cut talk).
Hardware revenue (excludes chips) -15% Y/Y; software -2%; global tech services -3%; global business services -2%; financing -3%. Within hardware: Mainframes -35%; Power systems -12%; x86 servers (just sold to Lenovo) -10%; storage -6%.

IBM is reiterating full-year guidance for EPS of at least $18 (consensus is at $17.84).
Big Blue spent an eye-popping $8.2B on buybacks in Q1, up from $5.8B in Q4. That allowed EPS to nearly meet estimates in spite of a $450M revenue miss. On the other hand, IBM's tax rate (the subject of recent scrutiny) rose to 20% from Q4's 11% and Q3's 16%. A 90 bps Y/Y increase in gross margin to 47.6% also boosted EPS.
Hardware/chip sales remain bleak: They fell 23% Y/Y vs. 26% in Q4.? Software +2% vs. +3%, global technology services -3% vs. -4%, global business services flat vs. +1%, global financing +3% vs. flat. The services backlog stood at $138B at quarter's end, down $5B Q/Q and $3B Y/Y.
Asia-Pac remains a weak spot: Sales fell 12% Y/Y. Americas were down 4%, and EMEA up 4%. ""Growth markets"" and BRIC sales each fell 11%.

IBM (IBM -0.6%) is licensing four ARM (ARMH +2.1%) Cortex CPU cores to offer to clients of its custom ASIC business, as well as ARM's Mali GPU cores. (PR)

The deal is notable both due to the size of IBM's custom ASIC ops - clients include Cisco and Juniper - and the fact the business has thus far relied on Big Blue's proprietary Power CPU cores.
The deal comes shortly after Broadcom (BRCM +0.7%), which has traditionally relied on cores from Imagination's (OTCPK:IGNMF) MIPS unit, announced it would build 64-bit network processors (NPUs) based on ARM cores using a next-gen 16nm process. Broadcom has taken out a costly ARM architectural license to build custom cores, and promises unmatched performance.
ARM-based cores have historically had a small presence in the NPU space, which has been dominated by Power, MIPS, and (largely Intel-based) x86 offerings. But the tide is turning: In addition to IBM and Broadcom, NPU vendors Cavium, Freescale, and LSI have embraced ARM.
NPUs are bound to be a lower-volume business for ARM than mobile processors. But they also carry higher ASPs, and potentially (if 64-bit cores are widely used) higher royalty rates.

The soft revenue and bookings guidance provided with Accenture's (ACN -3.8%) FQ4 results are oveshadowing the company's dividend hike and $5B buyback expansion. Consulting/outsourcing rival IBM (IBM -1.7%) is trading lower in sympathy. Wipro (WIT -3.2%) is also selling off, but outsourcing peers Infosys (INFY -0.3%) and Cognizant (CTSH -0.6%) have pared their morning losses.
Accenture's CC remarks (transcript) likely aren't helping. CFO David Rowland mentioned that while outsourcing bookings were healthy (book-to-bill of 1.4), all 3 consulting bookings segments - management consulting, tech consulting, and systems integration - were at the low end of its B2B guidance ranges. Total consulting B2B was 1.0
Rowland adds Accenture thinks the ""cycle of lower growth"" it has seen in recent quarters ""won't change much"" near-term.
Echoing comments from Cisco's John Chambers, CEO Pierre Nanterme mentioned Accenture is seeing more emerging markets ""volatility,"" even as the U.S. performs well and Europe stabilizes.
Janney's Joseph Foresi is staying bullish, arguing Accenture is ""well positioned given its high end capabilities to gain market share as outsourcing becomes more commoditized.""

A number of big cap tech companies have fooled this generation of analysts, says Jim Chanos (about minute 11 of the video), by acquiring their way into growth as organic expansion grinds to a halt. He won't name names (HPQ is already trodden ground), but Cory Johnson's mentioning of IBM and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) as fitting the bill has Chanos nodding his head, ""Acquisitions are a way of capitalizing R&D.""
""I'm very leery of tech companies that become value stocks,"" he says, partly explaining the reason for exiting another long - his stake in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? He considers it more a consumer products stock than tech stock, and believes the company is still innovating.

197,2013-09-17,-0.807,IBM promises to invest $1B in Linux,"

IBM (IBM -0.4%) says it will invest $1B over the next 4-5 years in Linux and related open-source tech for use with Power server line. Among other things, the company will create Linux app development programs for Power (System p) servers, and help enable software development for its 12-core Power8 CPUs (due next year).
The announcement follows a quarter in which sales of IBM's Power servers, which use proprietary Power CPUs and tend to have higher ASPs than Big Blue's x86 servers, fell 25% Y/Y.
Plunging demand for UNIX servers had much to do with the drop; IDC estimates industry-wide UNIX server sales fell 21% Y/Y in Q2. That compares with a 5.1% drop for Windows servers, and 1.5% growth for Linux servers. The firm believes Linux now accounts for 23.2% of industry server revenue, and UNIX just 15.1%.
Enterprise Linux leader and IBM partner Red Hat (RHT -0.8%) has to be pleased with the show of support.
IBM is also promising to invest heavily in R&D for is System x x86 server unit, which saw an 11% Y/Y sales drop in Q2 (IDC thinks industry x86 sales only fell 1.3%) and was reportedly on the block earlier this year.
In addition to helping System p server sales, IBM's Linux spending could bolster its new efforts to sell its Power CPUs to 3rd-party OEMs. Many of the Internet companies targeted by the effort are big Linux fans, but they depend almost entirely on x86 servers for now.

The decline is a little better than Q1's 5% drop, but still points to a bleak demand environment, as enterprise attempts to improve server efficiency (via consolidation and virtualization) and a mix shift towards cheaper, white-label servers preferred by Internet/cloud companies hurt sales. (PR)
IDC is even more pessimistic, estimating revenue fell 6.2% and units 1.2% (lower ASPs). (PR)
x86 servers (largely INTC-based) continue gaining share: Gartner thinks sales rose 2.1% Y/Y and units 4.5%. The opposite holds for Unix servers: sales -25.3% and units 27.4%. ""Other"" server sales (inc. IBM mainframes) rose 6.9%.
IBM and H-P (NYSE:HPQ), whose enterprise hardware units have fallen on hard times, remain the industry's top vendors, but continue to bleed share. IBM's share fell 160 bps Y/Y to 25.6%, and H-P's 420 bps to 25%.

DELL-OLD and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), as demonstrated by recent earnings numbers (I, II), remain share gainers. Dell +210 bps to 17.7%, Cisco +150 bps to 4.4%. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which is seeing rising (Intel-based) engineered system sales and plunging Unix/SPARC CPU server sales, is assigned a 5.8% share (-20 bps).
""Other"" vendors, including white-label firms, had a 21.5% share (+230 bps). IDC estimates sales of density-optimized servers (beloved by Internet companies) rose 26.6% to $735M, and now make up 6.2% of server revenue.

The prospective inquiry comes after Edward Snowden's revelations of the National Security Agency's surveillance of user data at major tech companies, and that it hacked into critical networks at Chinese and Hong Kong universities. It also follows U.S. accusations of widespread Chinese hacking and amid American hostility to telecom infrastructure companies Huawei and ZTE because of security concerns.

202,2013-08-15,-1.4180000000000001,IBM scores $1B cloud services deal; Trusteer price reportedly $800M-$1B,"

The Department of the Interior has awarded IBM (IBM -0.6%) a 10-year, $1B contract to provide a slew of cloud infrastructure services.
IBM's SmartCloud government and enterprise offerings are part of the package, as are SAP app hosting and cloud services tied to IBM's AIX (UNIX) OS.
The contract is IBM's biggest government cloud win to date, and comes as Big Blue continues to protest a $600M contract granted to Amazon Web Services by the CIA. IBM significantly grew its cloud infrastructure/Web hosting reach in June by acquiring private SoftLayer for a reported ~$2B.
Meanwhile, Israel's Ynet reports IBM paid $800M-$1B to acquire threat-protection software vendor Trusteer. IBM notes 7 of the top-10 U.S. banks, and 9 of the top-10 U.K. banks, use Trusteer to protect against ""financial fraud and cyber attacks.""
Like many security software upstarts, Trusteer relies on a cloud-based architecture to monitor Web activity and protect client hardware (inc. mobile devices). As Cisco's purchase of Sourcefire and FireEye's IPO filing indicate, enterprise interest in cybersecurity is picking up.

No details are provided about the nature of the SEC's concerns. However, it's worth noting companies tend to receive payment for cloud software/services subscriptions up-front, and recognize this revenue over the life of the contract. The timing of such revenue recognition can present some accounting issues.
