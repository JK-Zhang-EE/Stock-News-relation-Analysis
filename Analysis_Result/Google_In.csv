        Google?�s (GOOG, GOOGL) app suite could cost phone manufacturers as much as $40 per phone under its revised Android plans in the wake of the $5B EU antitrust fine.               The figure comes from documents seen by The Verge. The price applies to the Google Mobile Services suite of apps, which includes the Play store.??        But Google is offering separate agreements to cover some/all of the licensing costs for those that also choose to install Chrome and Google search, which were moved to separate licenses. The setup essentially puts all of the products back in one bundle unless a company wants to pay a higher price.?               Fees will vary depending on location and device type and would only apply to devices activated after February 1 next year. ?? ???Previously: Google changes EU app bundling after $5B fine (Oct. 16) ",0.9604,positive,0.7771034671532846

The EU didn?�t like that tactic, saying it shoved consumers towards its own products and search and away from the competition.?               Google will now offer licenses for Chrome and Search and a separate bundle containing Gmail, Maps, Docs, and more.

 It should be Snap's (SNAP -0.1%) and CEO Evan Spiegel's moment, Bloomberg BusinessWeek notes today -- but with rivals copying its popular disappearing-stories approach, it's facing continuing usage challenges. ""Investors have come to see Snap as a smaller, unprofitable Facebook (FB +0.7%) rather than a new idea that should be judged on its own merits,"" Sarah Frier writes, though Spiegel blames part of that on miscommunication. Facebook's in the midst of privacy-related flak, and Twitter (TWTR +0.5%) and YouTube (GOOG +0.5%, GOOGL +0.3%) are wrestling with bots and bad users, but Snap is having trouble gaining traction. Spiegel has drawn criticism for a ""dictatorial management style and penchant for secrecy,"" but has worked toward self-improvement in his approach and in breaking down management silos at the company. Aside from his shyness, Spiegel is dinged for an aversion to criticism (""No exec challenges Evan,"" a former employee says) and a tendency to ignore warnings when he's challenged. Some investors hope for another seasoned leader to come aboard a la Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Frier writes, but their opinions might not matter much with Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy holding all the voting power.

It will start a limited number of spots in pro football games (starting with the regular season opener Sept.10) as well as MLB, college football and Major League Soccer. Fox had tested the format during the Teen Choice Awards. It promises to reduce ad clutter in broadcasts, but costs a premium to maintain revenues under smaller loads -- and it's an open question whether marketers will find the increased expense worthwhile. But the Teen Choice ads did see paid premiums, with some paying $75,000 for the six seconds, Advertising Age reports. The minimal ad length is an import from the digital world, where YouTube (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +1%) has been using it for a year, and Facebook (FB +0.7%) is developing its own six-second spots as it leans on its new ""Watch"" video programming tab.

 At its advertiser conference today, Google (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) is unveiling a new store-sales measurement tool to extend what it already knows about online spending into the brick-and-mortar world. The new initiative will make connections between users who click on an ad online but later swipe a credit card to buy the goods at the advertiser's physical store -- currently a low-visibility area for advertisers. With its data partnerships, Google says it has access to about 70% of U.S. credit and debit-card transactions. So the tool won't work for the other 30%, or for cash payments. The company says it's aggregating that data and shoppers won't be identified by name. Pitching to advertisers (many of whom pulled back spending with Google over concerns about brand safety at YouTube), Google will also offer new ways to help merchants drive traffic to physical stores and find out how cross-platform ads are affecting sales.

That's because AT&T is said to be concerned that the publicity could allow other interested suitors like Apple (AAPL -0.4%) or Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) to jump in -- and indeed Apple is said to be monitoring the deal talks, after it made its own approach to Time Warner a few months ago, The Wall Street Journal reports. Those talks involved execs under Apple chief Tim Cook and didn't get beyond a preliminary stage. A source tells the WSJ that Google doesn't look interested in an offer for Time Warner. But the story of the deal points out just how much behind-the-scenes strategic talk is going on in the media/telecom spaces, as companies vie to be among the new leaders in an upended, converged digital media climate. Sumner Redstone was said to be considering not only the merger of CBS (CBS +2.1%) and Viacom (VIA +2.7%, VIAB +2.8%) that he's already pushing for, but also to combine that entity with Time Warner. Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA -0.5%) could join another company to get involved, the WSJ says, though that makes more sense if Time Warner's open to being parted out. Unlikely to join in this time: Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX +2.2%, FOXA +2.2%), whose own pursuit of Time Warner failed in 2014 at $85/share, and Walt Disney (DIS +1.1%).Previously: Time Warner at 15-year highs on merger talk; media companies rise (Oct. 21 2016)  ",0.9782,positive,0.7771034671532846

 Like it or not the huge success of Pok矇mon Go is likely to unleash a huge pop in mobile games designed around augmented reality. There is already an online petition asking for a similar Harry Potter Go game to be designed and many more mainstream characters are sure to start showing up in games linked to the cameras on smartphones and tablets. Companies stocked with an arsenal of appealing characters that could be brought into augmented reality games include Disney (NYSE:DIS), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS). Movie studios (LGF, SNE, VIA, VIAB) could also benefit as AR games tied around plot lines from old movies are developed (The Godfather, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, etc.) and used to promote new features. Many retailers and restaurant chains have already been active in trying to latch on to the Pok矇mon Go buzz (see?What's McDonald's doing inside the Pok矇mon code?), while GameStop (NYSE:GME) thinks it has an angle on the collectibles and accessories side. As the retail sector works out the science of in-game marketing opportunities, even more opportunities could arise.

Meanwhile, in a fresh attempt to get more of the local ad dollars moving to online channels, Google is launching local search ad options for Google Search and Maps that let advertisers prominently show their business locations. It's also testing Promoted Pins, which allow a business' logo to appear within Google Maps, and giving local businesses the ability to showcase special offers and inventory on their pages.

423,2016-04-15,5.8,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut.

After initially refusing to join T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) Binge On program (allows for ""DVD or better"" quality streaming that doesn't count against a user's mobile data bucket) on the grounds the service degraded video quality and didn't explain to users what was going on, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has done an about-face, stating YouTube and Google Play's video content will support the service.

Google suggests its decision stems from several changes made by T-Mobile to Binge On. Among them: 1) Clarifying for users what Binge On's video ""optimization"" does, and making it easier for users to opt out. 2) Allowing any video service meeting traffic-ID requirements to opt out. 3) Allowing video services to work with T-Mobile to optimize their streams.

Having concluded the business ""isn?�t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years,"" Alphabet/Google (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%) plans to sell its Boston Dynamics robot unit, Bloomberg reports. Toyota and Amazon are viewed as potential buyers.

Google acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 as part of a broader push to commercialize advanced robots that could be deployed in the home, in factories, and elsewhere. Boston has partnered with various military agencies, and YouTube videos of its robots moving at high speeds, displaying humanoid traits, and/or staying on their feet while navigating rugged terrain have been quite popular.
Bloomberg states Google's decision follows tensions between Boston and others taking part of Google's robot initiative, known as Replicant. Boston execs were reportedly reluctant to work with Google robot engineers in California and Tokyo, and the unit was unable to come up with a product that could be released in the short-term.
Three months ago, Google folded Replicant into its Google X long-term R&D unit, but didn't include Boston in the restructuring. The move occurred a little over a year after robotics chief (and former Android chief) Andy Rubin left the company.

Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. ""It?�s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud.""

As part of its latest push to grab share from market leader Facebook in the lucrative mobile app install ad market, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) will start allowing mobile users to demo a game for up to 10 minutes from within its mobile search results, via cloud-based streaming. After the 10 minutes are up, the game demo, which doubles as an ad, will give users the option to download the full game.
Also launched by Google for app developers: New tools for managing virtual goods and currencies, an API that lets game-players stream and share gaming sessions via YouTube, and the ability to deliver targeted ads to users who spent 30+ minutes playing games in the last 30 days.
Google has already integrated app install ads within its search results, Google Play, and its AdMob mobile ad network. Aside from landing more ad dollars from app developers, Google is looking to give mobile users another reason to rely on mobile search results (and the mobile web in general), rather than solely relying on mobile apps. Other efforts along these lines include Now on Tap, the deep linking of app content within search results, and Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative, which allows optimized articles pulled up via Google search to load almost instantaneously.

Through February, clients of Facebook (FB +0.5%) ad partner Kenshoo had increased their social media ad spend by 87% Y/Y, up from Q4's 50%, reports Baird's Colin Sebastian (Outperform rating, $120 target). Sebastian adds strong demand for Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads - they allow multiple products from an advertiser's catalog to be promoted - is contributing to the growth,, as is growing Instagram monetization.

Kenshoo estimates Dynamic Product Ads now make up 8%-9% of total social media ad clicks. Video ad clicks account for an estimated ~20% of Facebook's total (the same as Q4), and app install ads - a market for which Google (GOOG, GOOGL) just unveiled new offerings tied to mobile search - 10% of Facebook ad spend. Both search and social ad spend are deemed healthy as online ads continue taking share from offline channels, with search still accounting for ~3x as much spending as social.
Not surprisingly, Sebastian believes Facebook (has a long history of posting sales/earnings beats) can top Q1 estimates. Kenshoo also provided strong numbers in January ahead of Facebook's Q4 report - the company wound up trouncing estimates on the back of 57% Y/Y ad sales growth, up from Q3's 45% and Q2's 43%.

The remarks come after Finance Minister Michel Sapin ruled out a tax settlement similar to the $185M deal Google/Alphabet (GOOG -1.6%) has struck with British authorities, stating France is seeking ""far greater"" sums.
Google had just a 5% effective tax rate in Q4, down from 18% a year ago.

The JV, which limits Ford's legal liability, is said to be non-exclusive. Google has also been talking with other automakers, as it pushes forward with a goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) engineers have been working for about two years to fuse Android and Chrome OS, the WSJ reports. The Web giant plans to preview a unified operating system in 2016, and launch it in 2017.
A unified OS appears to mesh with new Google CEO Sundar Pichai's worldview. Pichai, who once directly oversaw Android and Chrome OS, predicted on Google's Q3 call ""mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.""
It would also be similar to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OS strategy: Windows 10 serves as a common OS for PCs and mobile devices, with the platform's Continuum technology enabling universal apps whose UIs change based on whether keyboard/mouse or touch input is being used. Apple, by contrast, continues to reiterate it has no plans to merge iOS and Mac OS; Tim Cook famously referred to such integration as being akin to combining a refrigerator and a toaster.
Possibly contributing to Google's decision: Android is far more popular than Chrome OS, claiming 1.4B active users as of September and an 82.8% Q2 smartphone unit share (per IDC), not to mention a giant developer base. By contrast, IDC estimates Chrome OS has less than 3% of the global PC market (the education market is a strong point).

In other news, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is making a fresh attempt to get Microsoft Office subs to defect to Google Apps. The Web giant promises not to charge subscription fees to business clients until their existing enterprise agreement for Office or another rival solution runs out, and to pay up to $25 per user to help cover deployment costs.
Microsoft, aided by its support for on-premise apps to go with cloud and mobile apps, has thus far done a decent job of keeping Google Apps at bay in spite of Apps' aggressive pricing ($50-$120 per user per year). Office 365 consumer subs totaled 15.2M at the end of the June quarter; commercial subs haven't been broken out.

 Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGY) is said to be close to filing a formal complaint against Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in Europe's antitrust investigation into the Android OS, The New York Times reports. The German telecom had filed a complaint more than a year ago when the EC was looking into Google's Web search; now, a formal complaint in this second probe could bring a wealth of data covering which services tens of millions of users access on their smartphones, and steer an EC decision on formal charges. Deutsche Telekom's complaint could be filed by early November, sources said, and it focuses on whether Google is unfairly promoting its own service, like Maps or Search, via Android. Separately, Russia has given Google until Nov. 18 to stop what it calls unfair bundling of its mobile service with Android or face fines. The European probe into Google's Web search is also likely to move forward this week.  ",-0.1796,negative,0.7771034671532846

They stand to gain about 55% of overall subscription revenue for their agreement, apportioned by time spent on the videos. YouTube is hoping to launch the service soon at around $10/month. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had confirmed in the spring that it was bringing an ad-free YouTube out, likely before year-end. Some of the companies kicked at first, arguing for disproportionate share compared to smaller YouTube creators, but YouTube is managing to keep the revenue split terms intact so far.

Looking to halt ongoing share losses to Gmail (or at least slow them), Yahoo (YHOO) has overhauled its iOS/Android Mail apps. New features include a smarter search engine that makes suggestions based on queries and message content, the ability to fully manage Hotmail, Outlook.com, and AOL.com e-mail accounts, and social media content integration for contact profiles.
Getting the most attention is Yahoo Account Key, a feature that lets users login without a password by linking their Yahoo account to a mobile device, and approving/denying logins via push notifications sent to the device. Yahoo argues Account Key is more secure than passwords, and eliminates the possibility of a user being unable to logic due to forgetting his/her password.

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ended a long-running patent spat involving about 20 suits in the U.S. and Germany. Financial terms are confidential.
Microsoft, which collects royalties from Samsung, HTC, and many other Android OEMs, had alleged Google's former Motorola Mobility unit (sold to Lenovo) infringed its IP. Google, which held onto most of Motorola's patents following the Lenovo deal, alleged Xbox consoles infringed its patents.
Much like Google/Motorola's settlement with Apple last year, the Microsoft deal comes with an agreement to cooperate on various patent issues. The tech giants plan to work on a royalty-free video codec meant to improve download/streaming speeds - Amazon and Netflix also back the effort - and lobby for a unified European patent system.
Separately, in a move that could partly be a response to ad-blockers, Google states its display ad network will now only charge advertisers for ads that are 100% viewable by by users. The company estimates 56% of display ads ""never had a chance to be viewed because they were below the fold, scrolled out of view, or in a background tab.""
Concerns about ad-blockers have grown following the recent launch of iOS 9, which supports blockers for Mobile Safari. JPMorgan has downplayed those concerns, arguing most ad-blocking takes place on desktops, that far more time is spent on mobile apps (largely immune to ad-blocking for now) than browsers, that publishers are starting to withhold content from those using ad-blockers, and that ad spend is shifting towards formats more immune to ad-blocking (e.g. native ads). The firm is concerned, however, about the fact ad-blockers prevent valuable tracking data from being collected.

As expected, Google (GOOG +0.5%) has refreshed its Nexus phone lineup with two models - a smaller device from LG known as the Nexus 5X, and a phablet from Huawei known as the Nexus 6P. (live blog)
The 6P sports a 5.7"" 2K OLED display - a moderate positive for Universal Display (OLED -0.7%), which still depends heavily on Samsung phone sales - and the 5X a 5.2"" display. Both devices support 4K and slow-motion video recording, come with fingerprint sensors and reversible USB Type-C ports (said to charge twice as fast as the iPhone 6+), sport 12MP rear cameras with large 1.55-micron pixels (good for low-light photography), and run on stock Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).
Traditionally, Google hasn't aimed for Nexus devices to become mass-market hits, but rather to serve as proof-of-concepts for its vision of what Android hardware and software should be. The company unveiled its Project Fi mobile phone service (only works with the Nexus 6 phablet for now) in April.
Google has also announced Android now has over 1.4B active users, and Google Play over 1B active users. The company stated in June 2014 Android's user base had topped 1B.

Update: Google states the Nexus 6P and 5X will join the Nexus 6 in working with Project Fi when they go on sale in October. Pricing has also been disclosed: The 6P will start at $499, and the 5X at $379.

Update 2: Some more hardware launches: The Pixel C, a 10.2"" Android tablet that starts at $499 and has a $149 detachable keyboard accessory; a new Chromecast HDMI dongle with an improved Wi-Fi radio; and Chromecast Audio, a $35 Wi-Fi streaming device that plugs into existing speakers.

Android Pay, first announced in May at Google I/O, has launched across the U.S. today. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) states the service works on any NFC-capable Android device running version 4.4 or higher, supports American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards issued by a slew of major banks/credit unions.
Android Pay works at 1M+ locales supporting tap-and-pay NFC readers. Retail partners include Walgreens, BJ's, Whole Foods, Macy's, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Panera.
With Google not collecting transaction fees for Pay - judging by the small fees collected by Apple for Apple Pay, it wouldn't be receiving much regardless - Android Pay's potential value lies in keeping Android users happy, and perhaps providing Google with purchase data that can be used for ad targeting. In addition to Apple Pay, the service competes with Samsung Pay, which supports both NFC and magnetic stripe readers, and launches in the U.S. on Sep. 28.
Separately, Google states it has added San Diego, Irvine, and Louisville to its list of cities where it's thinking of rolling out Fiber's pay-TV and gigabit broadband services.

Google also contends that the EU lacks the legal justification to demand it include rivals in its comparison shopping ads, arguing the EU would need to show that such ads are as essential as utility services.

Susquehanna launched coverage at Positive shortly before the announcement broke.
BMO's Daniel Salmon (Outperform, $770 target) joins many others in praising the improved transparency expected to result from the shakeup: ""The only complaint we heard from investors regarding last quarter?�s earnings call was the lack of increased transparency into the business. Breaking out YouTube was a popular request and while Alphabet won?�t do that, the move has certainly addressed the broader interest in better understanding the different components of Google...""
RBC's Mark Mahaney (Outperform, $750 target): ""We have long assumed that Google?�s Core Advertising segment is very highly profitable ??perhaps well north of 60% EBITDA margins. The new disclosure should confirm this ...? the re-organization will likely lead to some efficiencies from a more focused management team. Finally, we believe Mr. Pichai is a logical, and strong, choice to lead the core Google platform.""
Deutsche's Ross Sandler (Buy, target hiked to $840): ""We estimate Core Businesses (Search, YouTube and Apps) at $59B in revenue in 2015, growing 14% (+21% ex-FX). This would put the Emerging Businesses segment at $763m (Figure 1). If we were to assign a 55% EBITDA margin to Core (assuming near 70% for search, the remaining below the average), that business would generate $38B in 2016 EBITDA and likely fetch at 15x multiple once investors see the stronger financial profile. Emerging contains many loss making businesses and we believe EBITDA loss could be $3B in 2016.""

The WSJ states the product is being pitched ""exclusively to businesses,"" and that a new consumer version of Glass is still ""at least a year away."" The paper suggests this decision was made by Nest CEO/former iPod chief Tony Fadell, who began overseeing Glass several months ago and (perhaps owing to his Apple pedigree) ""prefers to keep products under wraps until they are ready for consumer use.""
As previously indicated by 9to5 Google, the enterprise Glass model is foldable, contain a larger display, and have a more rugged/industrial design than the Explorer Edition.

Google: ""People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier.

Google's Class A shares (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are now up 11.5% AH, and its Class C shares (NASDAQ:GOOG) up 10.7%, following the Web giant's Q2 beat. Both share classes are making new 52-week highs.
In the wake of a recent WSJ report about spending/hiring curbs, CFO Ruth Porat confirmed on the earnings call Google is now taking a more disciplined approached to spending, while adding she plans to work with Google business leaders to get more data. Google plans to direct roughly 70% of its spending towards its core business, 20% on adjacent areas, and 10% on big new ideas. (live blog)
When asked about dividends/buybacks, Porat didn't make any promises, but didn't shut the door on them either, stating her review process is still at an early stage and that capital returns have to work for the medium/long-term.
Porat and chief business officer Omid Kordestani provided plenty of positive remarks about mobile and YouTube growth. Among them: 1) YouTube ""watch time"" rose over 60% Y/Y in Q2 - its fastest growth rate in two years - with mobile viewing more than doubling. 2) The average YouTube mobile session lasts about 40 minutes, and the number of advertisers on YouTube is up 40% Y/Y.? 3) Mobile searches now exceed PC searches in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. 4) Google has indexed 50B search links within mobile apps.
As was the case on the Q1 CC, Google argues ad prices (CPCs) are being pressured more by YouTube ad growth than mobile. Without giving specific numbers, Porat noted mobile ad prices continue rising, and that PC prices aren't declining.

While Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Q2 revenue slightly missed estimates when factoring traffic acquisitions costs (TAC), its ex-TAC revenue of $14.35B was slightly above a $14.3B consensus. The reason: TAC fell to 21% of ad revenue from Q1's 22% and Q2 2014's 23%. That also, of course, helped EPS beat estimates.

Paid clicks: With the help of mobile, YouTube, and product listing ads, paid clicks rose 7% Q/Q and 18% Y/Y; annual growth accelerated from Q1's 13%. Clicks on Google sites +30% Y/Y; clicks on other sites -9% (hurt by quality-control efforts and perhaps also Facebook).

Ad prices: YouTube/smartphone ad growth and forex continue affecting cost per click (CPC): It fell 4% Q/Q and 11% Y/Y, after dropping 7% Y/Y in Q1. Google sites CPC -16% Y/Y; CPC on other sites -3%.

BMO's Daniel Salmon has upgraded Google (GOOG +1.5%, GOOGL +1.1%) to Outperform ahead of this afternoon's Q2 report, while setting a $670 target.
Salmon insists his upgrade isn't a call on earnings, but about ""increased confidence in upward estimate revisions in the coming quarters, anchored by stiffening margins."" He forecasts stabilizing margins and steady revenue growth will drive multiple expansion. ""That steady revenue view is underpinned by consistent (and lately underappreciated in our opinion) search growth and YouTube?�s continued push for TV ad dollars, where we believe it still has a considerable lead over emerging competitors, in large part due to the Google Preferred program.""
Dividends/buybacks (though not expected) are seen driving potential upside, as are efforts to use Google's search data to deliver targeted ads on YouTube and other ad platforms. Regulatory probes and the potential margin impact of moonshot projects (self-driving cars, Glass, etc.) are viewed as risks.
The upgrade comes a day after Google announced (confirming recent reports) it's rolling out a mobile buy button and on-site checkout option (referred to as Purchases on Google), along with other mobile search features meant to improve e-commerce ad conversions (and by doing so, increase mobile ad prices).

New Google (GOOG +3.3%, GOOGL +2.9%) CFO Ruth Porat is ""involved in an internal audit examining costs, revenue and accounting systems,"" the WSJ reports ahead of the Web giant's Thursday Q2 report.
The WSJ also states Google execs are now selecting which teams are allowed to hire new workers - in prior years, teams assumed they could add new staff each year. Moreover, travel, supplies, and events ""all require more justification or approvals than in the past,"" according to two sources.
Google's Q1 numbers already suggested the company is slowing down its oft-criticized spending pace: Operating expenses fell to 35% of revenue from 37% in Q4 and Q1 2014. Capex still rose 25% Y/Y to $2.93B.
Also: Cowen's John Blackledge is out with a bullish note. He reports U.S. search marketing firm EliteSEM saw its clients' Google ad spend rise 15%-20% Y/Y in Q2, as strong mobile ad growth offset ""flattish"" PC spending. Blackledge: ""Despite declining Desktop search volumes, paid clicks are still doing very well as Google continues to innovate and improve overall conversion."" He predicts mobile ad prices will reach parity with PC prices ""at some point in 2016.""

Believing YouTube and Google Play will make up 15% of the company's 2015 gross revenue (up from just 4% in 2010) and grow to 24% by 2020, Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju has hiked his Google (GOOG, GOOGL) target by $10 to $700, while reiterating an Outperform.
Ju respectively forecasts 2015 YouTube and Play gross revenue of $6B and $5.1B in 2015, and ~$16B and ~$14B in 2020, with margins/profitability improving as sales grow. Of note: Net revenue is much lower than gross, given YouTube provides a 55% cut to content partners and Google Play a 70% cut to developers.
He adds ""extensive checks with industry sources"" lead him to ""assume a steeper gross profit dollar growth trajectory for YouTube"" thanks to adoption of its recently-launched TrueView ad format, which lets users learn about/buy products shown in video ads. An ad-free subscription service is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, Facebook has been taking a number of steps to encroach on YouTube's turf.
Separately, The Information reports Google is working with Huawei on a next-gen Nexus phone due this fall, as well as on a Chinese app store. Local Web giants Baidu, Qihoo, and Tencent currently dominate the Chinese Android app store market.

 Nearly 18 months after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced it's buying leading smart thermostat/smoke detector maker Nest Labs for $3.2B, and 12 months after Nest struck a $555M deal to buy home camera maker Dropcam, Nest has refreshed its hardware and software lineup.
Among the new products: A second-gen Nest Protect smoke detector featuring a sensor that can recognize shorter wavelengths, and thus detect smoke more quickly. The Protect, which goes for $99, is also now 11% smaller and easier to install.
The Nest Cam home camera - Nest appears to be phasing out the Dropcam brand - is priced at $199 and supports Wi-Fi streams that can be remotely viewed on a PC or iOS/Android phone, and also (through a subscription service) stored in the cloud, much like the older Dropcam Pro. However, streaming resolution has been upped to 1080p from 720p, the stand has been overhauled to support more surfaces, night vision and motion detection are improved, and the product integrates with the Protect to send alerts (and let users start watching) when the Protect detects smoke.
Meanwhile, the Nest Learning Thermostat is getting a software update that adds safety/emergency alerts and an emergency shutoff feature for a home's heating/cooling systems. The Nest iOS/Android app has been updated to let users control all Nest/Dropcam devices.

Proactive will reportedly replace Apple's Spotlight search feature - a dedicated search bar will be included - and be placed to the left of a user's Home screen. Like Now, it will rely on data from various apps to push timely info to a user. The service will also integrate with Apple Maps to ""display personally relevant points of interest using an augmented reality interface,"" and have a UI that ""automatically populates with content based around three key parts of iOS: Apps, Contacts, and Maps.""
Also: 1) In addition to an augmented reality view, Maps will be given a ""Browse Around Me"" button that shows points of interest on an overhead map. 2) A Siri API codenamed Breadcrumbs will be provided to 3rd-party developers; its features will be limited due to privacy concerns.
The report comes less than a year after Apple replaced Google with Bing as Spotlight's default search provider via iOS 8; Google remains the Safari browser's default provider.? Sources tell 9to5 Google's iOS traffic has dropped since the iOS 8 launch.

3 months after the companies reached a deal to include tweets within Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search results, Google is adding Twitter's (TWTR +0.3%) content to its U.S. English mobile results, both via the company's mobile site and its widely-used Android/iOS search apps.

At least 6 firms have hiked their targets. Deutsche's Ross Sandler (Buy) notes net profit margin was flat in Q1 ""after imploding for three years,"" something he attributes to both cost discipline and management changes.
Looking at the top-line, Morgan Stanley (Equal-Weight) is worried U.S. revenue growth slowed to 11% Y/Y (the slowest pace since Q4 2009). With YouTube having likely grown over 40% Y/Y, MS thinks U.S. search revenue (higher-margin) was only up 9%-10%.
On the CC (transcript), CFO Patrick Pichette stated a mix shift towards YouTube ads - any un-skipped video ad is counted as a click - was pressuring Google's ad prices (CPCs), and not mobile. ""Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year."" Sales chief Omid Kordestani noted YouTube's TruView advertiser count rose 45% in 2014.

Ad prices (CPCs), affected by both forex and an ongoing mix shift towards smartphone ads, fell 5% Q/Q and 7% Y/Y, after dropping 3% Y/Y in Q4. Paid clicks fell 1% Q/Q (seasonality) but rose 13% Y/Y; they were up 14% Y/Y in Q4.
Google sites revenue (69% of total revenue) +14% Y/Y to $11.9B. Revenue from ad network sites (hurt by policy changes, and perhaps also the mobile shift) +1% to $3.58B. Other revenue (Nexus hardware, Google Play, etc.) +23% to $1.75B. Paid clicks on Google sites rose 25%, while clicks on ad network sites fell 12%.

Op. margin was 33% vs. 32% a year ago. Free cash flow was $3.69B, trailing net income of $4.53B thanks in part to a 25% Y/Y increase in capex to $2.93B. Google ended Q1 with $65.4B in cash/marketable securities (much of it offshore), and $5.2B in debt.

 Google's Project Fi wireless MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) service will piggyback on the networks of Sprint (S +2%) and T-Mobile (TMUS +2.2%) when it's not using Wi-Fi to route calls and data -- and while traffic is better than ""no traffic,"" analysts at Cowen and Evercore say it won't mean much benefit for the two wireless firms. Colby Synesael of Cowen says that financial gains will be limited for the two (and for Google): It's all about Google trying to shape the market in ways that might eventually pay off. The offer is ""compelling"" on price and technology and could make a monetary difference if device support grows, but it's more likely about carriers making Fi's practices mainstream, he says. On price, the data giveback and international aspects of Fi could pressure AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to follow suit, Synesael writes. Evercore's Jonathan Schildkraut found the announcement in line with expectations, though ""we also would not rule out a potential relationship between GOOG and the MSOs' Wi-Fi networks as another way to dis-intermediate the traditional carrier,"" he writes.

As rumored, Google's (GOOG +1.1%) anticipated U.S. mobile service has launched today with the help of network partners Sprint (S +1.7%) and T-Mobile (TMUS +2.2%). Also as rumored, Google is pricing aggressively and providing free roaming for the service, which is known as Project Fi.
Google is charging just $20/month for voice, SMS, Wi-Fi tethering, and international roaming in 120+ countries. Each GB of data (also comes with roaming) costs an extra $10/month; notably, any unused data is refunded. Users automatically connect to more than 1M Wi-Fi hotspots when they're available, and rely on Sprint/T-Mobile's 4G networks when they're not.
The big catch (also as expected): The service is only available for now via Motorola Mobility's huge Nexus 6 phablet (6"" 2K display). iPhone owners and those preferring smaller Android phones are out of luck. That limits the near-term threat posed to U.S. carriers by Fi, which (as the Nexus line does for hardware) aims to showcase Google's vision of what mobile services should be like.
Also: Much like many Google Web services launching in beta, Fi is launching as an invite-only service. U.S. consumers can request an invite on Google's Fi site.

What could have been: With Tesla (TSLA -0.5%) in dire straits in March 2013 as the company struggled to fix Model S bugs and convert pre-orders into actual sales, Elon Musk reached out to Larry Page and ""proposed that Google (GOOG +1.6%) buy Tesla outright,"" Bloomberg's Ashlee Vance reports through an excerpt from a Musk book due out on May 19.
Vance adds Tesla would've cost Google $6B at the time after factoring ""a healthy premium"" - Tesla's market cap is currently $25.9B. As part of the deal, Musk wanted Google to promise to invest $5B in factory expansions and let Musk run Tesla for 8 years, until it was ready to launch a mass-market car.
While ""Musk, Page, and Google?�s lawyers negotiated the specific terms of the deal"" in the following weeks, Tesla's Model S sales began to take off, and the company posted its first profit and repaid its DOE loan. No longer needing a white knight, Musk broke off talks.
A $6B Tesla acquisition would've been one of Google's largest, surpassed in size only by Motorola Mobility. Google, of course, has kept pushing ahead with its self-driving car efforts since 2013; the company has said it's talking with GM, Ford, Toyota, and others about bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020.

Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4.

Automobile experts think some functions such as self-parking, car retrieval features, and collision prevention technology will be approved federally and locally - while the full Muskonian dream may be a reach. BMW (BAMXY), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Audi (VLKAY), Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF), and Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) are the other companies/brands out in front with self-driving car development.

Citing two sources, the WSJ reports YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) had 2014 revenue of $4B, up from $3B in 2013 and good for 6% of Google's total revenue. However, thanks to revenue-sharing payments with content providers and infrastructure costs, the business was run at ""roughly break-even.""
Google is a year removed from putting former ad product chief Susan Wojcicki in charge of YouTube, with an eye towards improving monetization. YouTube, which is facing growing indirect competition from Facebook and Twitter, has been aggressively courting TV/brand advertisers and hatching plans to offer an ad-free subscription service. A music subscription service (Music Key) remains in trial mode.
Ars Technica reports Google will reveal Android Pay, an API for 3rd-party mobile developers that allows them to add both online and in-store payments support, at its May I/O conference. Android Pay is said to integrate with the consumer-facing Google Wallet, which just received the support of AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.
Consumers would be able to link Wallet accounts with apps supporting Android Pay. Ars: ""[T]he advantage [to Android Pay] would be that customers don?�t need to go through Google Wallet if they prefer not to, and third-party merchants will have an open platform API to drop into their apps.""
Android for Work, an enterprise platform that separates personal and work apps/data, has officially launched 8 months after being unveiled at I/O. Among other things, the platform includes data encryption, app security, device/app management, and file-collaboration tools.
A slew of enterprise software firms, including BlackBerry (previous), Salesforce, VMware, SAP, Box, and Citrix, are backing Android for Work. Google is hoping the platform will help address lingering enterprise fears about Android's security, and by doing so put a dent into iOS' outsized share of enterprise activations.

Though it had previously struck a deal to use TubeMogul's (NASDAQ:TUBE) video ad-buying platform, snack food giant Mondelez partly opted to use Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) rival DoubleClick Bid Manager platform to run YouTube campaigns following ""contentious behind-the-scenes negotiations,"" TheStreetSweeper reports. Google is believed to have used YouTube's TrueView ad system as leverage.
An analyst talking with TheStreetSweeper: ""It?�s clear Tube?�s technology is nothing special, since Google did this. And besides Google, there?�s a lot of other companies that could do the same.""
TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson has argued the Google/Mondelez deal is a positive for the online video ad industry at-large, and stated TubeMogul still thinks it ""will continue to be used as Mondelez's software for brand advertising and will be the pipes, if you will, to facilitate any of their publisher buys Google or otherwise.""
In addition to the Mondelez deal, TheStreetSweeper cites strong insider selling from CTO Adam Rose (through an automatic trading plan) and steep multiples relative to peers Rocket Fuel and YuMe as reasons to be bearish on TubeMogul.

VMware (NYSE:VMW) has struck a deal with public cloud rival Google to offer a slew of Google services through its vCloud Air platform. Specifically, Google's Cloud Storage service, BigQuery business intelligence query service, Cloud Datastore NoSQL (unstructured) database service, and Cloud DNS domain name service.
VMware: ""Existing vCloud Air customers will have access to the new services under their existing contracts and existing network interconnect with vCloud Air ...

VMware and Google are also setting up a private connection between their cloud infrastructures, and working to make the Google services manageable through VMware's vRealize cloud management suite.
The deal provides a shot in the arm for vCloud Air (initially known as vCloud Hybrid), which appears to have only a modest share of a public cloud market in which Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM loom large. Several new features were rolled out for the platform last week, partly through the use of VMware's NSX SDN/network virtualization platform.

With the Senate weighing a bipartisan effort to let companies repatriate offshore cash for five years at a 6.5% rate, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CFO Patrick Pichette states on the Q4 CC the passage of such a bill would change how his company spends. He adds ~60% of Google's cash is offshore, and ~40% domestic. (CC live blogs: WSJ, BI)
Google ended Q4 with $64.4B in cash/marketable securities, and $5.2B in debt. Speculation that dividends and/or buybacks might finally happen has grown a bit lately. Pichette says Google has nothing to announce regarding capital returns, but also insists Google does care about its stock price and reviews the matter with its board.
Chief business officer Omid Kordestani states YouTube's mobile revenue more than doubled Y/Y. YouTube, which is trying hard to grab brand ad dollars from TV advertisers, has already disclosed mobile now accounts for ~40% of its global viewing time.

If not for them, forex's revenue impact would've been above $600M. 2) Pichette suggests Google would be hiring even more employees if it could find enough qualified personnel. 3) Over $900M of Google's capex went into real estate purchases.

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) paid clicks rose 14% Y/Y in Q4, a slowdown from Q3's 17% growth and Q2's 2015. Google site paid clicks rose a healthy 25%, but ad network paid clicks fell 11%. Ad quality efforts appear to have hurt the latter, and indirect competition from Facebook might have as well.
Cost per click (CPCs - ad prices) remained under pressure due to low smartphone ad prices, falling 3% Q/Q and Y/Y; Q3's Y/Y drop was 2%. Google site CPCs fell 8%; network CPCs rose 6%.
Google sites revenue (69% of total revenue) +18% Y/Y to $12.43B; Network revenue +6% to $3.72B; other revenue (Nexus devices, Google Play, etc.) +19% to $1.95B. Traffic acquisition costs fell to 22% of revenue from 24%; the ending of the Firefox deal likely helped.
Spending remains aggressive: Operating expenses rose to 37% of revenue from 32% a year earlier; R&D spend rose 45% to $2.8B, sales/marketing 25% to $2.4B; and G&A 35% to $1.6B.
Capex totaled $3.55B (equal to nearly 25% of revenue), and headcount rose by over 2K Q/Q to 53.6K. Free cash flow was $2.81B, down from $2.98B a year ago and below net income of $4.74B.

Two day after reporting on Google's (GOOG +2.2%) SpaceX investment (confirmed a day later), The Information reports Google (GOOG +2.2%) is getting ready to ""sell mobile phone plans directly to customers and manage their calls and mobile data over a cellular network.""
Google won't be building its own network, but will instead operate as an MVNO leveraging Sprint (S +5.8%) and T-Mobile's (TMUS +1.9%) networks. Deals for wholesale network access are reportedly on the way. Sprint and (to a lesser extent) T-Mobile have caught a bid on the report.
Becoming a U.S. mobile carrier with Sprint/T-Mobile's help risks upsetting AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), who still tower over the local telecom landscape. However, it also gives Google a chance to experiment with novel/low-cost service plans, perhaps with the hope that other carriers (in the U.S. and elsewhere) will follow suit.

The paper adds Google plans to stop selling the $1,500 Explorer Edition of Glass to individuals (but not companies/developers) on Jan. 19, as it preps for a 2015 full commercial launch involving a second-gen model (and presumably a much lower price point).

Apple, which naturally views Google as a major rival, already dropped Google as iOS and Mac OS' Spotlight search provider this year in favor of Bing. Yahoo, meanwhile, is less than a week removed from announcing it has displaced Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider; Google is still the default provider in Europe.

Inbox, a new Gmail (GOOG +1.8%) app that has been launched in invite-only mode, forgoes the traditional inbox view in favor of Google Now-like cards that display (along with an e-mail's title/author) content such as photos, flight times, and appointments.
Google's app also tries to intelligently place e-mails into bundles that can be quickly viewed/deleted, and to parse out data such as phone numbers and addresses. Other features include the ability to ""snooze"" e-mails so that a user is alerted to them at a different time or location, and the ability to add reminders that appear on the app's main page.
""The world has changed a lot since [e-mail] was invented,"" says Gmail/Inbox product director Alex Gawley. He admits the app, which (among other things) attempts to help users contend with e-mail overload, is consumer-focused for now, but suggests features that will make it more business-friendly are on the way.
The Verge's Dieter Bohn: ""My first impression of Inbox is that it's really great, but a little weird ... Inbox is basically your e-mail, but mediated by Google. It's the Google Now version of your regular Inbox.""

Google (GOOG +0.2%) has led a $542M funding round in Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality startup promising to deliver 3D imagery that's far more lifelike than that provided by current virtual reality solutions, such as Facebook's Oculus Rift. Other investors include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), film studio Legendary Entertainment, and VC firms Kleiner Perkins and Andreessen Horowitz.

It adds the company ""intends to use an infrared camera similar to the Microsoft Kinect to create a 3-D understanding of the world around the wearer ??so the virtual objects can appear to go both in front of and behind things."" By contrast, Oculus relies on standard displays to project a flat, panoramic image.
Google reportedly doesn't have any current plans to integrate Magic Leap's tech with Google Glass. In February, the company launched Tango, an augmented reality solution for Android phones that can track motion and create visual maps of a user's surroundings.

The Google Shopping Express same-day/next-day delivery service has been renamed to Google Express. It has also added Chicago, Boston, and D.C. to its list of supported cities; existing markets include the Bay Area, West L.A., and Manhattan. Altogether, Google (GOOG +1%) says it now provides same-day to 7M+ people, and next-day to nearly 12M Northern California residents.
The service (free on a trial basis until now) has been priced at $95/year. While that's only slightly less than Amazon Prime's (AMZN +1.2%) $99/year fee, Google charges no additional fee for same day/overnight delivery on most $15+ orders.
Amazon charges Prime subs a $5.99 flat fee for same-day orders of up to 150 pounds. Its AmazonFresh service doesn't charge a per-order fee and covers the delivery of fresh/refrigerated items, but also costs $299/year and has a $35 minimum.
Express has added 16 new merchant partners in recent months, including Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, and PetSmart. Existing partners include Whole Foods, Walgreens, and Staples.
Google's announcement comes a day after Eric Schmidt called Amazon Google's biggest search rival. Express could provide the Web giant with valuable shopping data that could help Amazon's rivals deliver better targeted ads on Google properties.

Google (GOOG +0.5%) has been increasing the number of Google apps OEMs must pre-install on phones running the company's version of Android to ""as many as 20,"" The Information reports, citing confidential docs.
Google is also said to be requiring more apps be placed on the home screen or ""in a prominent folder,"" and that Google search be given more prominence. Affected OEMs reportedly include Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Huawei, and HTC.
The bundling of Google apps/services (especially Google search) is pivotal to Google's Android monetization strategy. Moreover, Google's ability to mandate bundling, together with Android's ~80% smartphone unit share, helps keep the company's mobile traffic acquisition costs down - the Web giant reportedly makes huge traffic acquisition payments to Apple for Mobile Safari search integration.
Regulators and OEMs haven't always been thrilled with Google's requirements. The WSJ reported in July EU regulators are likely to launch a formal probe of Google's Android licensing policies.
In January, Re/code reported Samsung had agreed (in tandem with a new patent cross-license) to tone down support for its own apps/services (often less popular than Google's) on Android phones. More recently, Samsung has been reported to be moving engineers out of its mobile software ops to other units.

Apple is just a month removed from announcing a huge partnership with IBM; The Information says Apple talked with H-P about a Siri deal before reaching an agreement with Big Blue.
Eric Schmidt mentioned last year Now could be used in the future to handle enterprise analytics applications, and thus address a burgeoning market for analytics tools that can be used by non-IT workers. The Web giant has long offered enterprise search appliances that can handle a variety of file types.

Following intense criticism of the deal, the EU will likely revisit parts of its search antitrust settlement with Google (GOOG +1.3%), the WSJ reports. A decision on the matter is expected in September, ahead of antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia's November departure.
In addition, the EU plans to investigate Google's practices in other areas, including (most notably) its Android licensing terms for mobile OEMs. A formal Android investigation is considered likely.
The EU has already been studying the licensing terms, which require a variety of Google apps/services to be bundled with its version of Android. The bundling is pivotal to Google's Android monetization strategy.
An EU ruling freeing OEMs from having to bundle Google apps/services might not have a big impact on installation rates (given their popularity with consumers), but it could give OEMs more leverage negotiate higher traffic acquisition payments.

The Information reported of Google's interest in Skybox in April. Aside from providing high-res imagery that could bolster Google Maps/Earth, Skybox provides related analytics services aimed at enterprises/institutions.
TechCrunch observes Skybox currently relies on just one satellite, and needs more funding as it gets set to launch a second one in June. The company recently placed an order for 13 small satellites.
DigitalGlobe (DGI +0.3%), which sold off when The Information's report came out, is taking the TechCrunch report in stride. The company is a major imagery supplier for Maps/Earth.
Separately, the WSJ reports Google's Project Tango, launched as an effort to create Android phones able to track motion and provide 3D visual maps of one's surroundings, now extends to tablets.
A 7"" prototype tablet sporting ""two back cameras, infrared depth sensors and advanced software that can capture precise [3D] images of objects"" is said to be on tap. There's a good chance OmniVision (OVTI +1.1%), already a Tango partner, is the image sensor supplier.

537,2014-05-22,6.12,"Google algorithm change dings eBay traffic, could force it to buy more ads","
 An analysis done by SearchEngine Journal estimates eBay.com (EBAY -1.1%) has seen a 33% drop in search traffic thanks to Google's (GOOG +1.3%) new Panda 4.0 algorithm update, and InterActiveCorp's (IACI -1.1%) Ask.com a 50% drop. Moreover, David Kim, the CEO of SEO firm Wordstream, has done an analysis that suggests eBay has ""lost around 75%"" of its keyword terms from Page 1 of Google's results, and 80% of its more specific (i.e. long-tail) keyword results. Kim blames the falloff on the fact eBay's search traffic tends to involve doorway pages with ""very little content,"" rather than actual product pages. ""I?�m surprised that Google has allowed these shenanigans to go on for so long."" He thinks Google's move has the effect of forcing eBay to buy Google's increasingly popular product listing ads (PLAs) to reach search users. eBay is already a PLA client, but (like Amazon) is less dependent on Google ads (and Google traffic in general) than many smaller e-commerce firms. The algorithm tweak follows changes to the display of Google's AdWords text search ads that lead them to blend in more with organic results, and thus potentially make them more likely to be clicked. eBay and IAC are underperforming amid Panda-related worries, but they're faring much better than RetailMeNot.

The Information reports Google (GOOG +1.7%), in a fresh attempt to boost usage of the its services, plans to offer small/mid-sized retail businesses ""heavily subsidized"" Wi-Fi hardware/software; the businesses would have to pay for the actual Web access. Automatic login would be provided via the HotSpot 2.0 standard.
No word on whether Google plans to use home-grown hardware, or a third party's. Aruba (ARUN +0.8%) is supplying access points for Google's Starbucks Wi-Fi deal (involves Web access, rather than subsidized hardware). Ubiquiti (UBNT -1.3%) is targeting the SMB Wi-Fi market with aggressively-priced products.
Newly-acquired Nest Labs is recalling 440K Nest Protect smoke alarms/carbon monoxide detectors due to a glitch that can lead users to accidentally turn them off with a hand gesture. Nest halted sales of Protect due to the issue in April, and began work on a software update.
In addition to declaring it needs $20B-$30B in foreign cash for M&A (possibly to appease regulators who want the funds repatriated/taxed), Google's December letter to the SEC (just published) raised eyebrows by stating the company might one day serve ads on ""refrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, and watches, to name just a few possibilities.""
However, Google has responded to the uproar by stating the remarks don't reflect its current product roadmap, and that's ""in contact with the SEC to clarify the language"" in the filing.

 Google (GOOG, GOOGL) needs $20-30B of its foreign earnings to finance acquisitions, which is why it had parked $35B abroad as at the end of March. The search giant also plans to use $2-4B for capex and $12-14B for an R&D cost-sharing agreement. Google made the disclosures in a December letter to regulators that it published yesterday. The letter comes amid controversy about how U.S. corporations keep large funds overseas in order to avoid U.S. taxes. In addition, Google revealed that it passed on a $4-5B acquisition deal for a foreign company in late 2013, although it didn't provide the name of the target.  ",0.918,positive,0.7771034671532846

Google (GOOG +0.1%) has bought Quest Visual, maker of an iOS app (Word Lens) that analyzes/translates text picked up by a device's camera, and places the translated text within a revised image.
Google, which has shown a keen interest in applying A.I./machine learning to a variety of applications, plans to integrate Word Lens' technology with Google Translate. The acquisition follows the launch of Project Tango, an effort to enable Android phones that can create visual maps of a user's surroundings.
Separately, Google has hired Ivy Ross, formerly a marketing exec for several retailers, to head its Glass unit.
Ross, who has also worked at eyewear firms Bausch & Lomb and Outlook, arrives as Glass deals with some well-known image issues ahead of its commercial launch. The $1,500 Explorer Edition of Glass just became available to the general public.

543,2014-05-12,11.19,IHS: Google Glass costs just $152 to make,"

Though Google (GOOG +1.7%) has been selling the Explorer Edition of Glass for $1,500 (to those able to get hold of one), IHS estimates the display glasses cost just $152 to make ($132 bill-of-materials cost, $20 assembly cost) after doing a teardown.
Himax's (HIMX +5.4%) LCOS microdisplay is believed to cost $20, and Glass' titanium frame $22. A Texas Instruments OMAP4 CPU costs an estimated $8.85; with TI winding down its mobile processor sales, Google will likely go with another CPU supplier for future Glass models.
IHS' teardown doesn't account for non-manufacturing costs such as R&D, shipping, and marketing - a Google spokesman asserts Glass ""costs significantly more"" than $152 to produce.
Nonetheless, if IHS' component cost estimate is reasonably accurate, its teardown suggests Google might be able to profitably sell Glass at a sub-$300 price point following a full launch. While mass consumer adoption is still a question mark, plenty of businesses/institutions are showing interest.
Last week, Chardan Capital (citing Himax's LCOS production forecast) raised the possibility Glass' commercial launch could be a 2015 event. Himax is rebounding some from last week's post-earnings drubbing, thanks in part to a tech rally.

Going forward, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will break out its paid click and cost per click data in more detail, CFO Patrick Pichette states on the CC. Numbers for Google's reporting segments (sites, ad network, etc.) will be given in addition to a company-wide figure. (CC live blog)
The remarks come after Google reported disappointing Q1 paid click growth (-1% Q/Q and +26% Y/Y). The numbers might fuel questions about the impact mobile apps (they account for 86% of U.S. smartphone activity, per Flurry) are having on search activity. When indirectly asked about the issue, sales chief Nikesh Arora only said Google is trying to succeed in both realms.
Pichette states EPS was hurt by one-time legal and M&A expenses, and that Google's expenses would've been in-line with its targets otherwise.
Separately, re/code reports Marissa Mayer is intent on convincing Apple to abandon Google as its default iOS search provider in favor of Yahoo (YHOO). Google's dominant mindshare, together with Apple's Maps experience, might make Cupertino think twice.

Titan Aerospace, once rumored to be in Facebook's crosshairs, has been acquired by Google (GOOG +0.8%).

The Information previously reported of Google's interest in Titan. The Web giant plans to have Titan's drones (the Solara 50 and Solara 60) complement Project Loon, which aims to provide 3G-or-faster Web access via hot-air balloons to areas lacking connectivity. Google might also have Titan support its Makani unit, which is working on airborne wind turbines.
Facebook, for its part, is looking to connect offline regions with the help of its Connectivity Lab and recently-acquired U.K. drone startup Ascenta.
Titan's 20-employee team will remain at its New Mexico HQ. In addition to providing voice/data services, Titan asserts its drones will be able to collect high-res imagery and sport atmospheric sensors (possibly of value for Google Maps). It expects individual drones to support up to 1Gbps of bandwidth.
