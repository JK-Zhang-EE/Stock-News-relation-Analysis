 Disney (DIS +1.2%) is increasingly likely to sell off the 22 regional sports networks it's getting from Fox (FOX +0.4%, FOXA +0.2%) in pieces rather than to a single buyer, the New York Post reports.

On the same day that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that Long Island City, NY, would be half of its HQ2, Goldman Sachs (GS +2.7%) inked a deal to provide $83M for a major new apartment complex less than a mile away in Hunter's Point South, Bloomberg reports.
The timing was an ""absolute coincidence,"" says Margaret Anadu, the head of Goldman Sachs's Urban Investment Group, the unit that executed the deal.
The project, being built by the Gotham Organization, will have more than 1,000 units, with about 80% designated for affordable housing.
For Goldman, advantages include tax breaks intended to attract investment into low-income areas labeled ""opportunity zones."" Investors that build in these zones can defer taxes on past capital gains and avoid them on future profits from their projects.
Much of Long Island City is located in such a zone.
Also Amazon's move closeby reduces some of the risk in investing in the area and helps to mitigate the possibility that the overall economy will sag by the time the complex gets built.

 In its look at Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) visual-shopping partnership with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Los Angeles Times digs into the appeal of the deal and floats the prospect of a buyout down the line. The new feature allows Snapchat users to focus the app's camera on an object or a barcode and get a pop-up card with the item's information on Amazon, with a clickthrough to buy -- though Snapchat didn't get into details of the arrangement. But the Times notes Amazon currently pays out commissions of 1-10% to referrers depending on product category. And while the feature is nearly identical to that in Amazon's own app, Pew research shows 78% of Internet users 18-24 use Snapchat, and Snap says its users are 20% more likely to make mobile purchases and 60% more likely to make impulse buys. Meanwhile, NYU marketing prof Scott Galloway notes Amazon's record of putting partners out of business once it figures out their model but notes Snap hired Amazon vet Tim Stone as its CFO (with $20M in stock), which could point to a bigger relationship in time. Snap is ""probably going to be below $5 a share"" within six months, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) sucking out the room's oxygen -- and Snap's Evan Spiegel “can’t sell to Facebook, since that would be admitting defeat.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking a conservative approach with its push into streaming entertainment, seeking high-quality shows with big names and wide appeal but without gratuitous sex, profanity or violence, WSJ reports. Tim Cook reportedly spiked a show about hip hop artist Dr. Dre's life because it featured drug use, sex and violence, sending a clear message to Hollywood that AAPL does not want shows that could taint is brand image. The result is an approach out of step with other video streaming platforms including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which have made their mark in original content with edgier programming that often wins critical acclaim. As a consumer product company, AAPL is especially exposed if content strikes a sour note, former NBC and Fox programming exec Preston Beckman tells WSJ.

 Disney's (DIS +1.5%) streaming ambitions play a big part in the company's three goals to strive in a heavily shifting industry, CEO Bob Iger says: Make great content, innovate in how you deliver the content, and seek a truly global nature. In an interview tied to his topping The Hollywood Reporter 100 list as entertainment's most powerful figure, Iger says of industry upheaval: ""I believe we have to look at this as opportunity vs. threat."" He's ""impressed"" with premium content gains at Netflix (NFLX -0.5%) and Amazon.com (AMZN +0.9%), but ""none of them is either Disney or Marvel. Or Pixar. Or Star Wars or National Geographic or FX or Searchlight or Avatar — I could go on."" That quote calls out the Fox media assets that Disney is about to add, but Iger says he doesn't anticipate a Netflix-type increase in spending. Responding to the recent analysis noting a couple billion dollars in revenue at risk, he says ""We're weaning ourselves off licensing revenue from third parties ... So there's more spend in production and there's less licensing revenue."" They're playing the ""long game and not the short."" He's got ""nothing but praise"" for the job Jimmy Pitaro has done since taking over ESPN, adding that in terms of society/politics ""Jimmy felt that the pendulum may have swung a little bit too far away from the field. And I happen to believe he was right."" (Today, ESPN Plus noted it hit 1M paying subs since its April launch.) It ""only makes sense"" for Marvel's Kevin Feige to oversee the X-Men franchise when the Fox deal is done, he says.

The state passed its own law in 2016 that requires online retailers to collect taxes if total sales cross $100K or 200 separate transactions.                President Donald Trump recently went on several Twitter rants about Amazon’s (AMZN +2.7%) failure to collect state sales taxes and not paying fair rates to the postal service.  Previously: Trump economic adviser comments on Amazon and ""level playing field"" (April 4) ",0.9542,positive,0.8167534523809524

 Loup Ventures thinks that Amazon (AMZN +0.5%) could be sitting on the ""operating system of automated retail"" with the Amazon Go concept, along with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) at the ready. In one of the more riveting pieces on Amazon's future disruption on retail, analyst Andrew Murphy explains why the Seattle e-commerce giant is in the pole position in the $50B (market potential) automated retail industry. Murphy on AMZN: ""Just as Amazon did with FBA and, to a lesser extent, AWS, Amazon is initially building a backend infrastructure for its own use with Amazon Go. And just like FBA and AWS, that infrastructure gets more valuable as it scales. The Amazon Go backend gives the company a trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space, clearly an area of interest given the Whole Foods acquisition. Perhaps the more critical question is why a retailer would work with Amazon? Our answer is the same as it is with all of Amazon’s best offerings: convenience. Retailers would have a turnkey solution for automated retail. While larger stores like Walmart and Target may not want to use the technology for competitive reasons, branded retail stores (like a Nike store) may be a fit if Amazon can create a product that helps save the retailer labor and processing costs.""Related stocks: WMT, TGT, NKE, GPS, LB, SPLS, FL, FINL, ANF, EXPR, URBN, ULTA, FIVE.

It was followed up by Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (FOX, FOXA), with nine nominations, and Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk (NYSE:TWX), with seven nominations. Three Billboards and The Shape of Water add up to a nomination haul for the Fox Searchlight label, which distributed both.

Greta Gerwig became just the fifth woman nominated for Best Director, for Lady Bird, and Jordan Peele just the fifth black man nominated, for Get Out; Steven Spielberg was left out despite directing best picture nominee The Post.

        A leak from AFTVNews claims that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has two new Fire TV products in the works, per Engadget.          The first combines the traditional Fire TV with Echo Dot functionality to bring more Alexa control features including far-field microphones and speaker that will let users control the TV from across the room without it being turned on first. The Fire TV can handle 4K HDR video at 60 frames per second.               The other “mid-tier” Fire TV lacks the full Alexa experience but could pack the same video potential and would give Amazon an entrant on the level of Google’s Chromecast Ultra. Amazon’s winning device strategy has remained developing products across a wider price range than the competition.                   Apple is expected to announce its own 4K-capable Apple TV at tomorrow’s launch event in an attempt to close the huge market share gap with Amazon. According to a Parks Associates report, Apple’s Q1 streaming market share dropped to 15%, down 4% on the year, while the Amazon Fire TV grew from 16% to 24%.   Previously: New iPhones might release September 22; Apple TV lost Q1 market share (Aug. 23) ",0.9917,positive,0.8167534523809524

Analysts from SunTrust and Oppenheimer are questioning if another bidder emerges as a defensive counterplay to the Amazon threat (per Bloomberg). While an offer from Kroger (KR -12.5%) for WFM could be considered a reach, there are plenty of European grocery store operators that are looking to box out the Seattle e-commerce giant. The idea of another bidder for Whole Foods is also rather interesting when the broad carnage across the retail sector being seen today is considered. P-E firms have significant ownership interests in many of the chain store stocks trading below market averages today, giving them a vested interest in keeping Amazon's brick-and-mortar ambitions at bay. #Amazon-WholeFoods  ",0.9788,positive,0.8167534523809524

 A new report is giving ammunition to ""cord-haver"" investors in an increasing high-profile TV industry debate. SNL Kagan sees a moderation in the cord-cutting trend, noting the ""rate of decline stayed about constant versus the past couple of quarters."" Meanwhile, at least some key companies are responding to the change: Even as pay TV bundle customers decline, they can see big new residential revenues from upticks in broadband Internet subscriptions. The firm forecasts broadband subscriptions will swell by more than 8M over 10 years, hitting 71M (ending up at 1.6 times the video sub numbers). Meanwhile, basic video subscriptions are expected to drop by annual compounded growth rate of 1.5% (to 45.4M by 2026), slower than last year's expected 1.7% decline, SNL Kagan says. It expects residential revenues to rise from $108.38B this year to $117.7B in 2016, and contributions from commercial services to push industry revenue from $130.57B today to $140.99B in 2026. On the other hand, Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research warns that more people are cord-cutting than you think, pointing to six straight quarters of Y/Y declines in pay TV subs. ""I’ve lost track of how many headlines I’ve seen over the last couple of years which posit that cord-cutting is somehow slowing down off the back of a small number of providers’ quarterly results,"" Dawson says, mainly due to observers focusing on quarterly net adds rather than annual changes, and looking at too small a sample size. Cable players have done well lately, but at the expense of telcos -- and even in cable, it's an example of the rich getting richer, with smaller players suffering.

The device weighs just 4.6 ounces, and much of it is only 3.4mm thin. It's thicker at one end, something The Verge says was done to ""evoke the spine of a paper book and make the device easier to hold in one hand."" As rumored (and indicated by a recent leak), the Oasis comes with a leather battery cover sporting a rechargeable battery (complements a battery inside the device). Amazon promises months of standby time when the cover is used.
Other features: 60% more LEDs than the Voyage, a 300 ppi display (on par with the Voyage), and ""a featherweight polymer frame that is plated with metal by structural electroplating"" (said to allow the Oasis to have the strength/rigidity of metal in spite of its lightness).

eMarketer estimates there were 83.4M e-reader users in the U.S. as of the end of 2015. However, that figure is only expected to grow 3.5% in 2016 to 86.3M, as many e-book readers opt to use tablets and even phones.

555,2016-03-22,6.5,Google plans to open 12 data centers as part of its efforts to battle Amazon,"

Google/Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.2%) will open data centers in Oregon and Japan in the coming months to support its cloud infrastructure and app (IaaS/PaaS) platform, and plans to open another 10 over the next 12-18 months. The facilities will be a mixture of Google-built data centers and ones leased from third parties.
The openings will increase the number of cloud ""regions"" supported by Google by 5x to 15 - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) currently has 12, with plans to open another 5 - and are part of a major expansion push led by new cloud chief Diane Greene. Google's efforts also include upping its enterprise sales and marketing spend - both to gain IaaS/PaaS share, and to sell Microsoft Office clients on Google Apps.
CRN reported last week Amazon/Microsoft cloud client Apple has begun using the Google Cloud Platform.

Though Google's IaaS/PaaS services have won praise for their performance, pricing, and developer-friendly features, Amazon - in addition to having greater mindshare - is seen as having a more extensive feature set and (via the AWS Marketplace and AWS Partner Network) a much larger ecosystem. 451 Group analyst Carl Brooks thinks Google still needs to add more enterprise compatibility, compliance, and security features. ""They are probably the most advanced cloud operation on the planet. It also doesn’t matter."" Greene's response: ""Those are fair requests from our users and they’re coming immediately.""

 With Viacom (VIA +1%, VIAB +0.3%) looking to sell a strategic stake in Paramount Pictures, who could be interested in buying? Foreign investors are likely, amid a wave of investment in Hollywood from overseas. China's Perfect World is putting $250M into a development slate at Universal, while in-country counterpart Bona Film Group said in November it was putting $235M into a slate at Fox. Analysts suggest the studio is worth about $5.5B today, notes The Hollywood Reporter, so a minority stake could still come to $2B. Viacom paid $9.8B for the studio a dozen years back. Major conglomerates like Alibaba (BABA +0.6%), Dalian Wanda and Fosun (OTCPK:FOSUF) have an appetite for Hollywood deals -- and Wanda already owns cinema chain AMC and producer Legendary Entertainment, while exploring a stake in Lions Gate. A key interest with those firms is ability to get Paramount products into China, where Transformers is a major phenomenon. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY +0.2%) has similar international media appetites. Fosun is trying to buy Bona and take it private, which would give it Bona's entry into Fox's slate. Back home, Lions Gate (LGF +8.8%) is now a frequent source of tie-up rumors -- and is on the move today amid Amazon.com (AMZN +0.1%) content-deal chatter. Both Lions Gate and Amazon could use a piece of Paramount for different reasons. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL +1.5%) has been floated as a possible bidder for Time Warner, as it may be shopping for content to feed TV dreams -- but a stake in Paramount would come far cheaper than trying to swallow Time Warner whole for $50B-$80B.

Nowak insists Amazon's North American retail ops are worth $256B at an 8% long-term margin, and its international retail ops $44B at a mere 2% margin. For reference, Wal-Mart (expected FY16 sales of $485B, 5.4% trailing 12 month op. margin) is currently worth $187B.

He now sees AWS having a $240B addressable market (up from $150B in 2013), as it continues expanding beyond its core cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market into fields such as infrastructure software, databases, and CDN services. On-premise IT services firms such as Accenture (ACN +0.2%) and Computer Sciences (CSC -0.2%) are deemed vulnerable to cloud adoption, in spite of their attempts to benefit via cloud migration services - Accenture recently partnered with Amazon to offer AWS migration services.

""I would see people practically combust,"" says a former project manager. Another ex-employee: “One time I didn’t sleep for four days straight.”
In a 6,000-word piece, the NYT depicts a culture in which employees work very long hours, stay plugged in during vacations, often get little sympathy for family/health issues, are ""held accountable for a staggering array of metrics,"" and are urged to aggressively critique co-workers on their ideas. High turnover is said to be a fact of life.
The column isn't entirely critical. It notes some interviewed employees ""said they thrived at Amazon precisely because it pushed them past what they thought were their limits,"" and that at its best, Amazon can be ""a place willing to embrace risk and strengthen ideas by stress test.""
It suggests the culture has its roots in Jeff Bezos' managerial philosophy, which (among other things) emphasizes obsessing over the customer experience, relying heavily on data, valuing honest criticism over workplace ""harmony,"" and urging employees to take ownership of product areas and ""dive deep"" to uncover problems. At a 2003 meeting, Bezos reportedly said he didn't want Amazon to become ""a country club"" like Microsoft.
In an employee memo, Bezos makes it clear he isn't pleased with the column. ""The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know ... But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR ... I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.""
Current Amazon exec Nick Ciubotariu has also responded with criticism. ""[W]e debate politely and respectfully, and you are given constructive feedback to course-correct if you are rude or disrespectful. No one, I repeat, no one is encouraged to 'toil long and late.' ... The Amazon described in this article may have existed, in the past.

eBay's same-day exit comes as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues rapidly expanding its same-day footprint. The company recently began providing free same-day services to Prime subs in 14 metro areas. Google, meanwhile, continues to invest in same-day services provided for retail partners.

Not surprisingly, analysts are rushing to hike their Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) targets as shares jump following a Q2 beat fueled in part by an 81% Y/Y increase in AWS revenue. Barclays and B. Riley have upgraded to bullish ratings; several firms were prescient enough to upgrade prior to earnings. Amazon has given back some of yesterday's AH gains; its market cap is at $251B.
In addition to AWS growth, Amazon's 390 bps Y/Y gross margin improvement is drawing attention. FBN's Shebly Seyrafi (Outperform) attributes the gains to AWS, 3rd-party seller unit growth (45% of paid units vs. 41% in Q1 and a year ago), and lower shipping costs (4.1% of revenue vs. 4.4% in Q1 and 4.8% a year ago). Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju (Outperform) also thinks favorable Japanese comps helped, while adding the Prime price hike and past warehouse investments are cutting shipping loss margins.
Mizuho's Neil Doshi (Buy): ""Revenue growth (ex-FX) accelerated to 27% YoY vs. 21% YoY in 1Q, which marked the strongest growth we’ve in about 3 years. Gross Margins reached a record high of ~35%, and CSOI margin was 4.6%; the strongest we’ve seen since 1Q11. While Amazon continues to invest in the biz, the flywheels are kicking in – Prime subscribers are transacting more on Amazon, while investments in FCs, 3P and AWS are helping to drive margins higher.”
SunTrust's Bob Peck (Neutral) cautions Amazon's spending history could mean recent margin/profit improvements will be short-lived. ""Amazon has a history of 'giving back' operational efficiencies to consumers via lower prices, as well as aggressively investing to drive long- term [free cash flow] growth. Key initiatives include 1) marketplace, particularly on adding fulfillment centers, increasing [fulfillment] for 3P sellers, and expanding in India; 2) Prime, especially on adding content and expanding Prime Now; 3) AWS, adding new features/functionality as well as geographic expansion (new region in India). As a result, we expect margins to trend lower from 4Q’15 onward.”
On the earnings call (transcript), new CFO Brian Olsavsky stated paid units rose 22% Y/Y, and active customer accounts by 7M Q/Q to 285M. When asked about AWS' growth pickup, he noted major price cuts carried out in Q2 2014 led to favorable comps.

Amazon (AMZN +1.1%) has begun selling physical goods on its Mexican site (Amazon.com.mx), and has also set up a local marketplace and fulfillment services for 3rd-party sellers. Until now, the company only sold e-books through its Mexican ops.
Mexico has 120M people, and had a GDP of $1.3T. Unreliable shipping and a lack of credit have slowed e-commerce adoption in the country. Amazon is looking to address those issues by enabling order pickups at hundreds of locations, and by providing a slew of different payment options (including, shortly, monthly payments). It's also providing free shipping on orders above 599 pesos ($38) that are fulfilled by the company.

A survey from research firm CIRP suggests Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) U.S. Prime subscriber base has risen by a modest 1M since the end of 2014 to 41M (an estimated 42% of Amazon's total U.S. customers). The firm notes growth was limited by users cancelling subscriptions following a 30-day free trial holiday season promo - in December, Amazon said it added over 10M new Prime users during the holiday season.
CIRP also estimates U.S. Prime subs are currently spending at an $1,100/year run rate, down from $1,500 during the holiday season - some doubts exist about those numbers. 34% of U.S. Amazon customers are believed to own a Kindle tablet or e-reader.
Amazon remains unwilling to disclose its Prime sub count, though it has stated Prime subs rose 53% globally and 50% in the U.S. in 2014. RBC estimated last September Prime had 30M-40M U.S. and 40M-50M total subs At the full $99/year rate (many users still get discounts), 41M subs would yield $4.06B in annual revenue.
CIRP's numbers come a week after Wal-Mart announced it plans to launch a $50/year Amazon Prime rival. Wal-Mart's service will promise delivery in 3 days compared with Prime's 2, and won't (initially at least) come with content services such as Prime Instant Video, Music, and Photos.

At least 7 other firms have hiked their targets. Amazon's market cap is at $181.6B.
JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth (upgrade to Overweight, $535 target) now values AWS at $66.3B, or 16x estimated 2016 EBITDA. ""[W]e think the reported profitability level far exceeded virtually all expectations. CSOI margins of 17% in 1Q15 and 14% in 2014 have been driven by increasing scale and greater utilization, along with additive services beyond core EC2 and S3 [computing and storage] services. When factoring in heavy depreciation, AWS has EBITDA margins of around 50%.""
Janney's Shawn Milne (upgrade to Buy): ""AWS segment margins of 16.9% in Q1, 14.2% in FY14 — well ahead of general Street thoughts that AWS was in 'investment mode,' and losing 5-10% (or more)."" He does note Amazon's North American retail op. margin fell to 2.5% in 2014 from 2.8% in 2013 (thanks largely to the Fire Phone debacle), but adds it rebounded to 3.9% in Q1.
Raymond James' James Kessler (upgrade to Outperform) focuses on Amazon's total margin improvement. ""Non-GAAP operating margin of 3.1% was ~100 bp above our/consensus estimates driven by improved gross margins and modestly lower than expected operating expenses. Amazon also guided 2Q margins above consensus at the high end.""

""[W]e believe Amazon's (AMZN +0.6%) fulfillment strategy is helping the company deliver a superior customer experience (which should drive unit and revenue growth) while extracting optimal value from each customer,"" writes Jefferies' Brian Pitz. His target has been hiked by $65 to $465, and his 2016 EPS estimate to $2.46 from $1.03.
Pitz asserts Amazon's huge fulfillment investments (often criticized over the years) enable ""increasing scale efficiencies and much better control of the customer experience & service levels"" relative to e-commerce rivals, and have allowed it to offer ""the broadest selection of fulfillment options at the lowest prices."" He also notes the spending has helped Amazon expand into local commerce (e.g. AmazonFresh and Prime Now).
Like others, he also sees AWS (an estimated ~6% of current revenue) acting as a growth driver, and believes it has a better margin profile than Amazon overall. Pitz's target is equal to 14x his 2016 EBITDA estimate; he forecasts a 30% EBITDA CAGR from 2015-2018.
The note comes ahead of Amazon's April 23 Q1 report. Shares blasted off in January following a Q4 EPS beat made possible by gross margin gains and slower spending growth. Fulfillment spend rose 17% Y/Y in Q4 vs. 30% in Q3.

Four months after the company started promoting local services to its customers, Amazon (AMZN +0.8%) has launched a Home Services site with the help of partners such as TaskRabbit, Pep Boys, and TakeLesons. Market leader Angie's List (ANGI -4.6%) isn't reacting well to the news.
Amazon exec Peter Faricy: ""We have 85 million Amazon customers who have shopped for products this past year that often require a service afterwards."" 700 services are initially supported; much like Angie's List, Amazon argues it helps connect consumers with trustworthy businesses. Only 3 out of every 100 professionals in each metro are said to be accepted, with Amazon making sure each business is licensed, insured, and passes a background check.
The e-commerce giant also claims it only takes 60 seconds for a customer to buy a service. Faricy: ""We have standardized and prepackaged all of our service offerings. So you know exactly what is going to be done and how much it’s going to cost you, up front, no surprises.""
41 states are currently supported; Amazon wants to provide strong coverage across the 30 biggest U.S. metro areas. The Verge notes a beta version of Amazon's site suggests the company is taking a 20% cut on standard services, 15% on custom services, and 10% on recurring services.

The startup boasts its solution can work with any protocol or hardware platform, automatically add new devices as they join a network, and scale to millions of devices without hurting performance. Honeywell is among the company's enterprise clients.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has bought 2lemetry for an undisclosed sum, and says it will continue supporting the company's clients. 2lemetry's services appear to complement AWS' Kinesis service, which provides real-time processing for massive data streams, including for data produced by IoT devices and sensors.
TechCrunch notes 2lemetry's Incoming service might particularly interest Amazon - it helps companies (such as retailers) interact with customers using data obtained via proximity beacons, geofencing, facial recognition, and other sources.

The NY Post reports Amazon (AMZN +1.7%) will launch an ad-supported video service next year that won't require a Prime subscription. ""The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn’t want to pay for Prime,"" says a source.
The WSJ reported in March Amazon was prepping a free/ad-supported streaming service, but Amazon quickly denied it had plans to do so. The Post's sources state roughly half of Amazon's Prime subscriber base (recently estimated by RBC to total 40M-50M) uses Prime Instant Video.

Skift reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is ""poised to launch its own travel service, featuring booking at independent hotels and resorts near major cities."" The service, known as Amazon Travel, will likely go live around New Year's, and initially ""feature a curated selection of hotels"" near NYC, L.A., and Seattle. Amazon would collect a standard 15% commission from hoteliers who would upload inventory and set prices. A source says hoteliers would normally list properties at rack rates, but would also be free to discount. Though limited in scope, Amazon's service would put the company into competition with online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Orbitz (NYSE:OWW). OTAs have already seen Google, the recipient of much of their ad spend, encroach on their turf a bit with new services. As Skift notes, Amazon could appeal to independent/boutique hotels with less marketing reach than major chains. Amazon, meanwhile, could leverage its user data to cross-sell or bundle various goods. Separately, Amazon has inked a 17-year lease to rent 470K sq. feet of office space (effectively an entire 12-story building) across from the Empire State Building. The WSJ previously reported Amazon wants the building to be the location of its first brick-and-mortar store, and also serve as a warehouse and order pickup/return hub.

Due to the antitrust issues (stemming from Google's ownership of YouTube), the companies reportedly couldn't agree on a breakup fee.Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN +2.4%) is rallying amid favorable reviews for the Twitch acquisition. Analyst Jan Dawson sees Twitch expanding Amazon's advertising scale and drawing in new customers, and thinks its streaming tech could strengthen other Amazon services. ""Amazon is clearly taking digital media very seriously, and spending heavily to fund it.""The Verge's Ben Popper observes Twitch will get to make full use of AWS, and will now have Amazon's resources to help with licensing. VC Ethan Kurzweil (a Twitch investor) thinks non-gaming use cases are possible. ""We think that Amazon is investing here in Internet infrastructure and something more than gaming media ...

Jeff Bezos: ""Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon ... Like Twitch, we obsess over customers and like to think differently, and we look forward to learning from them and helping them move even faster to build new services for the gaming community."" (PR)
Twitch had 55M+ unique visitors in July, and streamed 15B+ minutes of content produced by 1M+ broadcasters. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects the acquisition to close in 2H14.
Twitch is the third major digital content-related acquisition Amazon has made in the last two years: The company has also bought top book recommendation site Goodreads, and leading digital comics platform comiXology. Like Goodreads, Twitch provides a community of enthusiasts Amazon can potentially cross-sell various products to.
The purchase price is slightly below the $1B Google was previously reported to be offering. Re/code reports Google-Twitch talks had died before Amazon swooped in.

The Information reports Amazon (AMZN +1%) ""has been in late-stage talks"" to acquire popular game-broadcasting platform Twitch, and could announce a deal shortly. Prior reports stated Google (GOOG -0.4%) was close to a deal to buy Twitch for ~$1B, or had fully reached one.
Twitch, whose platform allows users to live-stream their gaming activity (along with running commentary), has 50M+ users and a network of 4K+ content provider partners. The startup claims its average user watches 95 minutes/day of content.
Buying Twitch would represent a major investment by Amazon in free (ad-supported) online video. Thus far, the bulk of the company's Web video investments have been directed towards Prime Instant Video. Amazon has also been fleshing out its own game studio.
The Information's report shortly follows a WSJ report stating Amazon is working on a keyword-based ad platform (called Sponsored Links) that aims to replace ads based on Google's bread-and-butter AdWords keyword platform on Amazon's site and elsewhere. Amazon has already built up a sizable ad business, aided by its volumes of customer data.

""We have a long-term view ... We’re not trying to optimize for short term profits,"" states Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CFO Tom Szkutak on the Q2 CC, repeating a mantra his company has uttered in some form for years. Judging by the reaction to the company's EPS miss and guidance for a sizable Q3 op. loss, investor patience seems to be wearing thin.
Szkutak admitted Amazon Web Services' near-term growth has been hurt by an ongoing cloud infrastructure price war with Microsoft and Google - while North American ""Other"" revenue was up 38% Y/Y, it fell 3% Q/Q, and Y/Y growth decelerated from Q1's 60%.
He also suggests Amazon's Q3 bottom line will be pressured by a ""significant"" increase in video content spend. The company plans to spend $100M on original programming alone, as it tries to counter Netflix's big content investments and keep Prime renewal rates high.
On the bright side, Szkutak says Prime subscriptions are still growing well following this year's $20 price hike, and that Q2 subscriber adds topped year-ago levels (no specific numbers, as usual). CIRP survey data appears to back him up.
Regarding China, he states Amazon has ""a lot of interesting things"" planned, and will continue investing in the Middle Kingdom. Alibaba remains the Chinese e-commerce market's 800-lb. gorilla.

AT&T's site states a 32GB model will go for $199 with a 2-year contract (same as the 16GB iPhone 5S or Galaxy S5).

The European Commission is preparing an investigation into the corporate tax codes in Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

If the investigation reveals that multinational corporations received the state aid, the commission could obligate them to pay it back, even though such requirements are uncommon.
The probe comes after yesterdays news that Apple used Irish tax laws to allow it to pay just a 3.7% tax rate on non-U.S. income during its last fiscal year. Other companies that will be investigated include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).

The site observes Now has already seen a string of setbacks: eBay's local commerce chief and East Coast operations head have both departed, and some early retail partners such as Best Buy are gone. CEO John Donahoe downplayed eBay's same-day efforts in February. The company was more upbeat in 2013, promising to bring Now to 25 cities by the end of 2014 with the help of U.K. acquisition Shutl. Today, eBay only says it's ""focused on supporting"" Now in its 5 current markets, and isn't ""announcing any new market expansions at this time."" Amazon (AMZN +1.9%) must be happy to see the report. Unlike eBay and Google (just expanded local delivery to the whole of NorCal), Amazon is relying on its own fulfillment infrastructure (replete with AmazonFresh vans) instead of 3rd-party retailers for same-day. Its strategy has higher up-front costs, but could also allow for more efficient delivery. eBay continues to trade lower following news of PayPal chief David Marcus' departure.

After initially trading higher following its Q1 revenue beat, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) finished AH trading up just 0.3%. A possible factor: CFO Tom Szuktak shared on the CC Amazon's Y/Y paid unit growth fell to 23% in Q1 from 25% in Q4 and 29% in Q3. Slowing unit growth ""remains a yellow flag since [the metric] is a better proxy than revenues for the overall velocity of the business,"" says Baird's Colin Sebastian.
While paid unit growth slowed, ""Other"" North American revenue, a segment dominated by Amazon Web Services, saw revenue growth accelerate to 60% from 52% in Q4. For now, the segment only accounts for 6% of revenue.
Thanks to AWS and 28% EGM growth, North American sales growth (+26%) was roughly even with Q4. International sales growth picked up to 18% from 13%, with 27% EGM growth offsetting 4% media growth.
AWS and 3rd-party fulfillment growth helped gross margin rise 230 bps Y/Y to 28.8%. But fulfillment spend rose to 11.7% of revenue from 11.1% a year ago, tech/content spend (boosted by video licensing and AWS capex) to 10% from 8.6%, and marketing to 4.4% from 3.9%.

Nonetheless, Taylor says payments is something Jeff Bezos now considers a priority. “The pressure I feel from Jeff is, ‘Go faster.’”
In an attempt to challenge PayPal's (EBAY +1%) online/mobile payments dominance, Amazon launched a payments solution for unaffiliated merchants last October.

The trend, which can be very costly for firms, has prompted them to act. Clothing sizes are the biggest reason why shoppers return purchased goods, so companies have been using past transactions to give consumers gentle reminders about which size fits them the best.

Though Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been seeing intensifying competition in the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, Synergy Research's numbers, like Gartner's, suggest AWS continues to dominate.

Synergy estimates AWS had a 35% IaaS share in Q3, or 5x that of #2 IBM, whose position has been bolstered by SoftLayer. All other vendors are assigned shares below 3%.
The situation is a little different in the cloud app platform (PaaS) market. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Heroku, long a major player, is given a market-leading 18% share. But AWS is close behind at 17%, and so are Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Azure (14%) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) App Engine (13%). All other vendors are estimated to have sub-5% shares.
Altogether, Synergy thinks Amazon grew its IaaS/PaaS revenue by 55% Y/Y, outpacing the 46% growth seen by the overall market. Moreover, AWS' IaaS/PaaS revenue is believed to have eclipsed that of Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce combined.
The report drives home the competitive challenges faced by Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), and other firms striving to take IaaS and/or PaaS share from market leaders.
Synergy thinks the traditional Web hosting market, which Rackspace remains well-exposed to, and which has been pressured by the IaaS market's rise, only grew 3% Y/Y in Q3.

The Commerce Department estimates U.S. e-commerce sales rose 17.5% Y/Y in Q3, and made up 5.9% of total retail sales (up from 5.7% in Q2 and 5.2% a year ago). The growth rate is down a bit from Q2's 18.2%, but up from Q1's 16.4% and Q4 2012's 15.5%.
comScore previously estimated U.S. PC e-commerce sales rose 13% Y/Y in Q3, and that mobile sales rose 26%.
Amazon (AMZN), which soared last month following its Q3 report but gave back some of its gains in early November, managed to make new highs today. Shares are now up 48% YTD. eBay (EBAY +0.2%), which has been range-bound this year after a very strong 2012, closed up fractionally.

comScore forecasts U.S. holiday season e-commerce sales (both PC and mobile) will be up 14%-17% Y/Y, even though retailers have six less days to work with (26 vs. 32) than in 2012.
Amazon plans to cope with the shorter season partly by starting its Black Friday promotions a day early. eBay, meanwhile, plans to waive the $5 delivery fee normally attached to its Now same-day delivery service, and to also offer longer hours for delivering Now orders made with retail partners.

Several analysts argue Amazon's (AMZN +3.1%) cloud-based WorkSpaces PC virtualization platform could prove to be a long-term threat to Citrix (CTXS -5.4%) and VMware's (VMW -2.9%) on-premises offerings.
Nomura notes WorkSpaces is initially focused on SMBs, who tend to shy away from expensive on-premises deployments, rather than the enterprises Citrix derives a large portion of its sales from. But it still thinks the platform could become ""a serious and broader-based competitor if it ends up vying for larger enterprises."" Jefferies, meanwhile, calls WorkSpaces attractively priced and a threat to the majority of Citrix's business.
Stifel is defending Citrix. The firm argues Amazon is ""targeting the low-end of the DaaS market as it doesn’t offer the full range of features (or deployment options) that Citrix’s desktop solutions offer."" It's worth noting many cloud-based apps/services initially targeted SMBs before gradually moving upmarket.
Also: Amazon has launched AppStream, a service that allows apps hosted on its cloud infrastructure to be streamed to mobile devices (and perhaps eventually PCs). The service could end up acting as competition for Citrix and VMware's app virtualization platforms.
In addition to Amazon, Cisco's guidance is likely pressuring Citrix and VMware. Citrix and Cisco have an application delivery controller partnership, and VMware (though competing with Cisco in some areas) maintains a multi-faceted software alliance with the networking giant.
Last month, VMware bought Desktone, developer of a PC virtualization platform than can enable cloud-based services. VMware has promised to cross-sell Desktone's platform to its 11K service provider partners.

At its annual re:Invent conference, Amazon Web Services (AMZN +1.2%) has unveiled WorkSpaces, a PC virtualization offering that allows businesses to host virtual desktops on Amazon's cloud infrastructure.
PC virtualization/thin client software leader Citrix (CTXS -3.7%) dived following the product launch, but has recouped some of its losses following news the company is an AWS PC virtualization partner. Top Citrix rival VMware (VMW +0.2%) has fallen moderately, but is still near breakeven.
Amazon asserts WorkSpaces is easier to manage than traditional PC virtualization offerings, and also carries much lower up-front costs. AWS chief Andy Jassy: ""Virtual desktops are difficult to set up, they’re difficult to manage, you have to worry about the hardware, the virtual desktop infrastructure ... We wondered if there were an easier way.""
WorkSpaces is priced fairly aggressively - Amazon is charging $35-$60/month per user, depending on the plan, and doesn't require any long-term commitments.
Also: AWS, which has depended heavily on Internet companies for its early growth, has bolstered its enterprise chops by adding support for SAML 2.0, a commonly-used identity management protocol. Adding SAML 2.0 support makes it easier for enterprises to manage access to, and enable single sign-on for, AWS-hosted services.

comScore estimates U.S. PC e-commerce sales rose 13% Y/Y in Q3 to $47.5B. That's down from Q2's 16% clip, and matches Q1 2013 for the slowest pace seen in the last two years.
But the firm also believes U.S. mobile e-commerce sales rose 26% to $5.8B. That's a pickup from Q2's 24% clip, and gives mobile an 11% share of total U.S. e-commerce spend. comScore thinks mobile sales will be near $9B (+25% Y/Y) in seasonally strong Q4, and have ""an outside shot of hitting $10 billion."" 62% of Q3 mobile spending is believed to have come from smartphones, and 38% from tablets.
Recent industry commentary has been mixed. eBay (EBAY -0.4%) provided light Q4 guidance while stating U.S. e-commerce growth was slowing, but the company partly backtracked on its comments. Groupon (GRPN -2.8%) partly blamed its Q3 revenue miss on seasonal weakness, but is optimistic about holiday season demand.

The money-losing USPS is doubtlessly happy to see the extra business, which comes at the expense of traditional Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) partner UPS.
Much like last month's hiking of Amazon's free shipping minimum for non-Prime customers to $35 from $25, the deal acts as yet another inducement for Amazon customers to upgrade to Prime. It also comes as Amazon gradually rolls out its AmazonFresh same-day delivery service.

Jefferies observes Amazon's op. income has topped the high end of guidance for 8 straight quarters. Evercore likes the fact Amazon's North American 33% electronics & general merchandise (EGM) sales growth (~2x U.S. e-commerce growth) beat the firm's 27% estimate.
Accelerating growth - Q3 rev. growth of 24% topped Q2's 22% - and ongoing gross margin improvement - Q3 GM rose 240 bps Y/Y to 27.7% - are getting attention. Global media revenue ($5.03B) +9% Y/Y in Q3 vs. +7% in Q2, EGM ($11.05B) +29% vs. +28%.
Amazon's total Q3 paid unit growth was 29%, even with Q2, and 3rd-party sellers still made up 40% of unit sales. Active accounts +9M Q/Q to 224M after rising by 6M in Q2. Also, North American ""Other"" sales (dominated by AWS) rose 56% Y/Y to $1.01B.
At the same time, Amazon's aggressive spending isn't letting up. Fulfillment spend rose to 11.5% of revenue from 10.5% a year ago, and tech/content spend to 9.2% from 7.8%. TTM capex +$320M Q/Q to $4.59B.
Interestingly, eBay (EBAY -1.6%) is lower even as Amazon soars. When contrasted with Amazon's figures, eBay's Q3 Marketplaces numbers and Q4 guidance point to further share losses on a relative basis.

comScore estimates U.S. e-commerce sales (exc. travel) rose 12% Y/Y to $26.1B. That's down from Q2's 16% and Q1's 13%.
RBC's Mark Mahaney views the data as ""neutral to negative"" for Amazon (AMZN +0.1%) and eBay (EBAY -0.7%), but also largely in-line with his forecast for 15% full-year growth.
On the other hand, comScore estimates U.S. online travel sales growth rose to 11% in August from Q2's 9% and the highest growth rate seen since Jan. '12. Mahaney views this as a positive for Priceline (PCLN -0.4%), Expedia (EXPE -1%), and TripAdvisor (TRIP +0.1%), and now thinks his 7% full-year growth forecast could be conservative. Others are already forecasting 8%-10% growth.
Priceline shares topped $1,000 for the first time yesterday, and are currently trading a little below that level.

Among the principles the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee thinks should guide the creation of a national online sales tax law: Internet companies shouldn't face ""new or discriminatory taxes not faced in the offline world;"" online and offline retailers should be ""on equal footing;"" laws should be simple and compliance costs low; businesses should have the right to protest unfair treatment, and state governments ""should be encouraged to compete with one another to keep tax rates low .""

EBAY, which hosts many merchants collecting little or no sales tax and has opposed national sales tax law efforts, says it's ""very encouraged"" by the principles. A trade group pushing for a national law calls the principles a ""great first step.""
Though the Senate signed off on an online sales tax bill in May, the bill has been mired in the House since then.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which collects tax from a large and growing portion of U.S. customers, has backed the bill. Other e-commerce-related names that stand to be directly or indirectly affected by the passage of a law: OSTK, NILE, ECOM, SALE.

 DirecTV (DTV -1.1%) and Dish Network (DISH +1.1%) are more at risk than cable operators (TWC, CHTR, CVC) from a new generation of consumers unwilling to pay premium prices for TV packages, according to analysts. Pay-TV providers aren't the only group keeping an eye on the so-called ""cord nevers"" as broadcasters (DIS, CMCSA, FOXA, CBS, SBGI, BLC, NXST) weigh how long the current TV content model can stay locked in place. The bundling approach to cable/satellite packages helps broadcasters reap lucrative content deals. The outlook: ""The revolution will take a long time,"" notes one grounded industry insider, but Internet TV (SNE, NFLX, AMZN) players could try to accelerate the shake-up through innovation.

836,2013-08-22,5.16,Bloomberg: Amazon testing mobile network for Kindle gear,"

Sources tell Bloomberg Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has tested a mobile data network for its hardware using spectrum from Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT). However, they caution it's not clear if the tests, conducted ""in the vicinity"" of Amazon's Lab126 R&D unit (responsible for the Kindle line), are still ongoing.
Amazon has partnered with carriers to provide subsidized mobile connectivity for Kindle devices. Last year, the company introduced a 4G-capable version of the 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD that offered 250MB/month of data for just $50/year. But even a moderate data user (never mind a heavy Prime Instant Video user) will go through 250MB in a month quickly.
Meanwhile, carriers are seeing a pickup in 3G/4G tablet subscriptions thanks to the rollout of shared data plans.
The cost of any large-scale mobile network, even one limited to major urban areas, would run into the billions. Amazon's up-front costs would be much lower if it decided to lease capacity from an existing carrier and become an MVNO.
Hard-luck Globalstar has been petitioning the FCC for the right to use 80% of its satellite spectrum for terrestrial 4G mobile and Wi-Fi services. A ruling could arrive in the coming months.
