 Intelsat (NYSE:I) is 10.1% lower, building on yesterday's postmarket declines from a 10M-share offering that will let BC Partners and Silver Lake cut stakes. While it's tempting to read into that a take on prospects for Intelsat's high-stakes bet on mid-band spectrum monetization, RBC Capital expects it's more about private-equity portfolio management as the year's end draws near. Operators are still in an enviable position to monetize the ""Goldilocks"" band -- sitting at the just-right spot among the three main 5G bands -- and a crystallizing event in C-band should come in early to mid-2019, analyst Wilton Fry says. He has an Outperform rating on Intelsat with a price target of $66, implying 149% upside. (h/t Bloomberg) It's hard to blame BC and Silver Lake for taking profit after the year Intelsat's had, ""but the obvious question is 'why now'?"" asks Barclays.

WSJ���s Heard on the Street column says Intel���s (NASDAQ:INTC) chip production delay is causing problems for Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which reported a bumpy earnings report yesterday.Intel has three facilities mass producing its 14nm chips, but those facilities provide for PCs (recently experiencing a surprising uptick), the booming data center segment, and Apple���s new iPhone line. Intel has already boosted its capex for the year by $1B but adding production takes time.Micron says some PC makers aren���t buying as many of its memory chips because of slowed production due to scarce CPU chips. And the demands on Intel causing the shortages might not end soon.Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says the impact could last beyond the current quarter.Micron shares are��down 4.5%��premarket to $43.98.Intel shares are down 0.1%��to $47.14.Previously: Micron drops after Q4 beats, NAND ASPs down, downside Q1 guidance (Sept. 20)Update: Headline wording updated to clarify that it was the guidance part of the quarterly report that was rough.

As part of its recently-announced efforts to streamline and its ongoing efforts to narrow mobile losses, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is ending further investments in SoFIA, a mobile SoC line (the chips pair a baseband modem with an Atom processor) targeting low-end Android phones and tablets, and Broxton, an Atom processor meant for high-end smartphones/tablets. Broxton was set to use Intel's next-gen Goldmont CPU cores and a 14nm manufacturing process.
An Intel spokeswoman says resources previously directed towards SoFIA/Broxton will go towards ""products that deliver higher returns and advance our strategy."" The company plans to pitch OEMs on Pentium and Celeron chips related to its new Apollo Lake platform (based on Goldmont) as a solution for tablets and low-end PCs. Its partnership with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip, through which Rockchip has been developing SoFIA SoCs, remains in place.
Broxton (originally due in 2015) had already been delayed, as had certain SoFIA SoCs. Apple and Samsung's heavy reliance on their own app processors, together with tough competition from Qualcomm and MediaTek, had limited Intel's mobile chip sales.

Fortune reports Aicha Evans, the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) exec in charge of the company's wireless modem and radio chip engineering teams, has been convinced by CEO Brian Krzanich to withdraw her resignation. Bloomberg reported three weeks ago Evans is resigning.
The news comes in a month that has seen Intel announce major layoffs and the pending departures of its Client Computing Group and IoT Group chiefs. It also comes amid expectations Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem, among the products overseen by Evans, will be used within some iPhone 7 units.

The JV's SoCs are expected to rely on AMD's next-gen Zen CPU cores, which will debut on AMD chips made using Samsung/Globalfoundries' 14nm manufacturing process. MKM's Ian Ing, who upgraded AMD to Buy today, argues the JV's chips ""will prove to be a serious challenge"" to Intel's Chinese dominance.

As it is, the company announced in July it's delaying the launch of its first 10nm CPU platform (Cannonlake, once expected in late 2016 or early 2017) to 2H17, and will instead roll out a third 14nm platform (Kaby Lake, succeeds Broadwell and Skylake) this year.
Intel's strategy change could lower its capex needs - the company has already been investing conservatively in recent years. At the same time, it could give foundry providers TSMC, Samsung, and Globalfoundries a chance to eliminate Intel's historical manufacturing process edge. TSMC plans to begin production for its 10nm process (believed to have a lower transistor density than Intel's 10nm process) in Q4, and migrate to 7nm in 2018.

Six months after upgrading Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Market Perform (shares were at $28.22 at the time), Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon has downgraded the chip giant back to Underperform, and cut his target to $26 (12x his 2017 EPS estimate).
""[W]e do not believe this means the company is necessarily out of the woods,"" says Rasgon. He's concerned about Intel's Q1 and Q2 performance, and thinks there could be a ""meaningful reset"" of full-year guidance when the company reports in April. His 2016 and 2017 EPS estimates have respectively been cut by $0.22 and $0.26 to $2.16 and $2.18 (below consensus estimates of $2.41 and $2.65).
Rasgon: ""While Intel is good at pulling rabbits out of hats, they may find it tougher now. Inventories have ballooned over the last year, increasing the risk of underutilization in the event of cuts. Receivables have once again spiked ... The shares aren't necessarily expensive, but neither are they cheap ...

AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telecom, SK Telecom, and other major carriers have thrown their weight behind Facebook's Open Compute Project (OCP), an increasingly popular initiative to create open-source designs for cheap/power-efficient servers, storage systems, and networking hardware.
OCP could aid carrier efforts to adopt network functions virtualization (NFV), which allows switching, routing, and other networking functions to be handled by software running on commodity hardware. AT&T aims to virtualize over 75% of its network functions by 2020, Verizon, meanwhile, has been testing commodity switches running on software supplied by startups.
Switch/router giant Cisco (CSCO -1.3%) could see its carrier sales pressured if OCP-based hardware is widely adopted by telcos. Facebook has been contributing modular data center switch designs to OCP. Meanwhile, startup Big Switch Networks has contributed a Linux-based network OS that supports switching and routing.
Intel (INTC -0.6%), on the other hand, could benefit, as many OCP designs rely on the company's CPUs. On its Q4 earnings call (transcript), Intel estimated it had less than 10% telecom/networking penetration, and predicted the market would be a 2016 growth driver for its Data Center Group (DCG). The company also talked up its networking opportunity during its November investor day, and noted AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, and SK Telecom have deployed Intel-based NFV solutions.

Nag also argues Intel's dividend (3.5% forward yield based on an increased quarterly dividend of $0.26/share) provides downside protection should a global downturn arrive. The upgrade comes less than two weeks after Intel tumbled in the wake of a Q4 beat - slowing server CPU growth and cautious commentary about Chinese/Asian demand weighed on shares.
Intel's desktop and notebook CPU volumes respectively fell 9% and 10% Y/Y in Q4; ASP increases of 9% and 6% limited the revenue impact.

Up strongly yesterday as markets rallied and TSMC set a 2016 capex budget of $9B-$10B (up from 2015 capex of $8.12B), a slew of chip equipment makers are seeing big losses amid a 3.3% Nasdaq drop after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) used its Q4 report to disclose its 2016 capex budget has been cut by $500M to $9.5B (+/- $500M). That's still up by $2.2B at the midpoint from 2015's $7.3B, but lower than the $10.1B-$11B spent annually from 2011-2014.
On Intel's earnings call (transcript), CEO Brian Krzanich indicated the budget cut is related to logic (i.e. CPU) capex, and insisted no specific major factor was responsible. ""As we went from the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the team has just sharpened down all the numbers and went through it in more detail.""
Major decliners: Applied Materials (AMAT -4.3%), Lam Research (LRCX -6.5%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC -3.8%), ASML (ASML -6.3%), MKS Instruments (MKSI -3.9%), Ultratech (UTEK -4.9%), Teradyne (TER -3.1%), Advantest (ATE -4.6%), and Ultra Clean (UCTT -5.2%).

Stifel's Patrick Ho argues the selloff is a buying opportunity. ""[W]e have already seen positive preannouncements with two of our names (Ultra Clean, Axcelis) and we expect more upside surprise than those on the downside ... We believe 3D NAND momentum continues to build while there has been some initial buying for 10nm logic (Intel) and foundry (TSMC).

Intel (INTC -8.5%) has received a mixture of target hikes and cuts (and no downgrades) after posting a Q4 beat, providing above-consensus sales guidance (aided by the Altera acquisition), and reporting weaker-than-expected Data Center Group (DCG) sales growth. Nonetheless, shares have dropped below $30 for the first time since October.
Aside from DCG's performance, analysts have voiced concern about earnings call remarks (transcript) indicating Chinese demand, as well as Asian demand in general, is soft among both consumers and enterprises. CEO Brian Krzanich: ""I would say [the weakness] is a little bit heavier on the client-side, so the PC side than the data center side, but we are seeing some of it on the data center side as well...""
Goldman's James Covello (Sell rating): ""Intel noted that organic 1Q trends are at the low end of seasonal, primarily due to weaker demand in China in consumer and enterprise PCs, which in turn drove higher internal inventory; We believe investors will be focused on whether DCG growth can return to the mid-teens target range after three quarters of sub-15% [Y/Y] growth...""
Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon (Market Perform): ""We had already believed ���mid-teens��� growth targets for DCG are optimistic, a point of view that seems to be gaining credibility given the company���s commentary on end demand. And of course PCs still don���t look great either ... Our estimates go up, but the drivers are low-quality, and purely non-operational (exclusion of amortization, a lower tax rate, and the aforementioned accounting games).""
MKM's Ian Ing (Buy): ""Intel has turned more cautious on growth since the November analyst day, particularly given uncertain China ... This not only affects client computing but data center as well, as management affirmed only double-digit growth for this segment instead of a mid-teens target.""
Rosenblatt's Kinngai Chan (no rating): ""While the current demand climate remains soft due to uncertainty in the emerging market regions, we believe Intel could begin to outperform starting from 2Q16 mainly due to product cycle refresh in both the Datacenter and the PC client segments.""
Also mentioned on the earnings call 1) Krzanich argues growing sales to the telco/networking market (where Intel has less than 10% penetration, and where NFV growth is providing a lift) will help DCG deliver double-digit 2016 growth. 2) PC CPU ASPs benefited from higher sales of Intel's Core i7 and gamer-focused K-series CPUs. 3) Over 40% of server CPU volumes for cloud clients involved custom SKUs. 4) Memory sales rose over 20% Y/Y.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has used the supercomputer industry's SC15 conference to unveil SSF, a high-performance computing (HPC) system architecture meant to make HPC deployments easier for enterprises that have remained on the fence to date.
Intel notes HPC deployments, a bright spot in a soft enterprise server market, have expanded beyond traditional use cases such as DNA sequencing, nuclear simulations, and weather modeling to cover a variety of corporate analytics workloads. The company argues a system-level approach will help eliminate system bottlenecks, and allow enterprises to use a common infrastructure for numerous HPC and non-HPC workloads.
Central to SSF is Omni-Path (OPA), a high-speed interconnect fabric for HPC server nodes (first outlined by Intel a year ago) running on Intel CPUs. OPA is promised to enable switches that are both cheaper and more power-efficient than ones relying on InfiniBand interconnects (widely used in HPC deployments). Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many other OEMs plan to offer OPA-based switches and servers, which are expected to ramp in early 2016.
Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX), the top player in the InfiniBand interconnect market, is in the crosshairs. Earlier today, Mellanox announced Switch-IB 2, an InfiniBand switch supporting 100G port speeds and (notably) embedded processing power for offloading communications tasks from server CPUs.
Along with SSF, Intel has announced Knights Landing, the latest entry for its Xeon Phi co-processor line, will be generally available in Q1 2016; Intel was previously aiming for a late 2015 launch. Knights Landing features 72 CPU cores and 16GB of on-package DRAM, and promises big performance gains over the current-gen Knights Corner. It takes aim at Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tesla GPU line, which remains the biggest player in the HPC co-processor market.
Aside from potentially growing the HPC market, SSF/Omni-Path could boost Intel's dollar content for various enterprise server deployments, as it continues pursuing a 15% Data Center Group revenue CAGR through 2018. Altera, whose FPGAs can be paired with Xeon CPUs to accelerate HPC workloads (among other things), could also aid in boosting dollar content.

Intel's (INTC -0.8%) RealSense gesture recognition camera/sensor technology (first announced in 2014) has received attention on the first day of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). The chip giant says RealSense will now support Linux, Mac OS, and several other platforms, in addition to Windows and Android, and also work with Google's Project Tango, which uses cameras and sensors to create 3D maps of a user's surroundings on Android devices.
Also announced by Intel: Optane, an SSD platform that combines the company's 3D XPoint next-gen memory (recently announced in partnership with Micron) related controllers, interface hardware, and software. In a demo, an Optane SSD delivered over 5x the IOPS performance of Intel's high-end P3700 NAND flash SSD.
The first Optane drives will launch in 2016. Potential use cases include performance-optimized enterprise and Web/cloud servers, as well as high-end PCs and workstations.
In addition, Intel has announced partnerships with microcontroller vendors Atmel (ATML -1.7%) and Microchip (MCHP -1.4%) to integrate its EPID privacy tech - it allows cloud services to be quickly/securely provisioned to Web-connected devices - with Atmel/Microchip's products, which are used to power many embedded systems.

Credit Suisse has upgraded to Outperform, and Morgan Stanley and Drexel Hamilton to Neutral ratings. Not surprisingly, many analysts argue a much higher bid will be needed to win over management and/or are doubtful regulators would allow a Chinese company to buy Micron. UBS' Stephen Chin: ���Valuation appears low as a potential $21 a share bid is 8.3 times fiscal year 2016 PE or low end of the historic range of 7 to 15 times whereas Micron���s stock was at $32 just 5 months ago.���

Slides leaked by a Chinese site Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to launch the first CPUs for its 14nm Skylake platform (successor to the current-gen/14nm Broadwell line) in August/September, and gradually flesh out its Skylake lineup over the following 4-5 months. Intel has said Skylake will launch in 2H15.
Desktop Skylake chips codenamed Skylake-S will reportedly arrive in August and September - with Intel skewing its Broadwell launches towards notebooks and tablets, some PC OEMs are opting to pass on launching desktop Broadwell parts and wait for Skylake.
Reportedly due in September: High-end notebook CPUs (Skylake-H), mainstream notebook CPUs (Skylake-U), and ultrabook/tablet CPUs (Skylake-Y). Additional Skylake-H parts are said to be due in October/November, and additional Skylake-U/Y parts in January.
Whereas Broadwell prioritized lowering power draw and enabling new form factors (see Apple's 12"" retina MacBook), Skylake appears to emphasize CPU/GPU performance gains as much as power savings. The PC industry is counting on Skylake and Windows 10 to spark a 2H15 rebound following a rough start to the year.
Separately, Digitimes reports Intel and Chinese mobile SoC partner Rockchip have stepped up their efforts to sell Rockchip's 3G Atom SoC (part of the SoFIA line, launched in March) to white-box Chinese tablet makers.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is partnering with programmable ASIC maker eASIC (EASI - recently filed for an IPO) to create custom Xeon CPU products that (per the companies) can deliver up to 2x the performance acceleration of a solution using an FPGA for programmability. Web/cloud service providers (major buyers of custom Xeon parts) are targeted, as are security and big data/analytics workloads.
eASIC, whose customers include Seagate, Ericsson, and Huawei, argues ASICs designed by its clients deliver the programmability, development cost, and deployment time advantages of FPGAs (to a large extent, at least), while maintaining the size, unit cost, performance, and power draw advantages of standard ASICs. 60%-120% and 50%-80% performance and power advantages are respectively claimed over comparable FPGAs.
The alliance could act as a hedge against reported acquisition target Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), whom Intel has partnered with to create solutions that put a Xeon CPU and Altera FPGA in the same package. Web/cloud providers looking to use FPGAs to accelerate processing for algorithms they've developed are among the intended clients. FPGAs can still deliver a level of on-the-fly programmability that eASIC's offerings can't.
For those interested, eASIC filed its latest IPO prospectus last week. The company had 2014 revenue of $67.4M (+126% Y/Y), and a net loss of $1.1M. As of March 31, eASIC had enabled over 200 custom IC designs and shipped over 21M chips.

Pitched as a cheaper alternative to the Surface Pro 3 (starts at $799, launched last May), Microsoft's (MSFT -0.6%) Surface 3 tablet starts at $499 and eschews the Pro 3's Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs in favor of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) less powerful/recently-launched Atom x7 (Cherry Trail). Its display is smaller (10.8"" vs. 12""), and resolution slightly lower (1920x1280 vs. 2160x1440). In what might be the final nail in the coffin for Windows RT, the tablet runs on Windows 8.1 (free upgrade to Windows 10 later this year).
The Surface 3 weighs just 1.37 lbs. and is only 0.34"" thick (the Pro 3 is at 1.76 lbs. and 0.37""), and goes without its costlier sibling's fan. The rear and front cameras respectively have 8MP and 3.5MP resolutions vs. 5MP apiece for the Pro 3. Other features - a kickstand, optional type cover accessories, a business-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio, stereo speakers with Dolby (DLB -0.2%) audio support - are similar.
Microsoft claims 10 hours of battery life when playing video. The Surface 3 begins shipping on May 5 (pre-orders start today); Verizon and T-Mobile will sell 4G-capable models later this year. To win over consumers, Microsoft is throwing in a free year of Office 365 Personal (normally $70/year).

After rising 28.4% on Friday on reports Intel (INTC -0.3%) is in talks to buy the company, Altera (ALTR -3.8%) is paring its gains in response to downgrades from CLSA, Morgan Stanley, and Macquarie. Morgan Stanley has also downgraded Xilinx (XLNX +0.3%), which rose 5.8% on the reports.

Reactions to the reports, which vindicate at least a few predictions, have been largely positive. Among the perceived benefits to Intel from a deal: 1) Cost synergies from handling the manufacturing of Altera's FPGAs in-house. 2) Lowering Intel's PC dependence amid soft industry demand. 3) The potential to better cater to the likes of Facebook and Google (and keep ARM rivals at bay) by creating Xeon server CPUs with built-in FPGA circuitry to accelerate algorithm performance. 4) The potential to create system-level solutions for servers, telecom infrastructure gear, and other products that combine processors, FPGAs, and other chips.
CLSA: ""[W]e view a potential Altera deal favorably given the manufacturing and end-market synergies ... Altera���s strong base station presence is valuable to Intel ... we see $0.05-0.10 accretion to our 2016 EPS, and additional accretion down the road as manufacturing moves in house.""

Cowen: ""[W]e surmise the deal would be heavily debt financed ... ALTR is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margin than INTC ... PLDs are one of the only verticals requiring leading-edge silicon in which INTC does not compete.""
Though upgrading Altera to Market Perform, Wiliam Blair is more cautious. ""[W]e believe Altera���s fundamentals have deteriorated as the company has faced multiple headwinds. These include market share loss to Xilinx, declining margins, delays in new product ramp-ups, and competitive issues ... On top of this, we believe Altera (as well as Xilinx) has been negatively affected by the increased adoption of SoC solutions, resulting in decreased demand for FPGAs for Glue Logic functions."" Bernstein (still bearish on Intel) notes Altera's revenue is only equal to 3% of Intel's.
If a deal happens, many think Xilinx will be acquired soon afterwards. The short list of chipmakers big enough to swallow Xilinx ($11.1B market cap) and arguably having complementary products includes Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Analog Devices, NXP/Freescale (about to merge), Skyworks, and Avago. There's also some speculation Intel, which has sat out the chip industry's recent M&A wave, will follow up on an Altera deal by making other purchases to lower its PC exposure.

238,2015-03-19,-0.133,Intel scores Tag Heuer watch design win; IBM OpenPower servers arrive,"

With Apple Watch set to ship next month, leading high-end Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer plans to launch a watch that runs on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear platform, and is powered by an Intel (INTC +0.1%) CPU.
The PR provides few details about the watch, but Reuters reports the product will be a version of Tag's bestselling Carrera line, and launch next autumn. With Carerra watches often priced above $2K, the deal will likely be more valuable to Intel as a reference win - the vast majority of early smartwatch launches have involved ARM-based CPUs - than as a revenue-generator.
Intel is going after the wearables market by pitching its Atom CPUs for relatively powerful devices, and its tiny Quark CPUs for less resource-hungry products where battery life is a priority. It has also launched Curie, a button-sized module containing a Quark CPU, flash memory, Bluetooth radio, and sensor hub. The company has a partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica, and has reportedly landed a design win for the next version of Google Glass.
Separately, IBM (IBM +0.2%) has announced the first OpenPower servers - servers running on IBM's Power CPUs (compete against Intel's Xeon line), but which can be made by 3rd-party OEMs and could sell for much less than IBM's Power-based servers historically have - will launch in Q2 and be sold by Taiwanese manufacturer Tyan. IBM plans to offer its own OpenPower servers later this year in partnership with Taiwan's Wistron; they'll be aimed at the high-performance computing (HPC) market.
Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, and Rackspace are among the companies that have given their support to OpenPower. IBM is both hoping to halt Power's long-term share losses to Intel, and grab a bigger share of an Internet/white-box server market (dominated by Intel systems) that accounts for a large and growing portion of global server spend.

PC/server virtualization software vendor Citrix (CTXS +0.5%) has also seen its products disappear from the list, as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) McAfee security software unit. While the total number of products on the list has risen by over 2K since 2012 (to nearly 5K), the number of approved foreign tech brands has fallen by a third.
The data highlights the ripple effects of the 2013 NSA spying uproar, as well as China's broader interest in promoting local tech firms relative to foreign suppliers. Bloomberg reported in December the Chinese government is ""aiming to purge most foreign technology from banks, the military, state-owned enterprises and key government agencies by 2020.""
Cisco's Chinese sales have already been under heavy pressure for several quarters. Thanks in part to the government's efforts, the networking giant's Chinese orders fell 19% Y/Y in the January quarter, compared with just a 1% drop for other Asia-Pac markets.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY), and Huawei are among the local firms likely to benefit from the government's attempts to buy local.

Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win.

Making good on ARM's promise of high densities, 18 servers - each sporting one quad-core CPU - can fit onto a blade, and 16 blades can fit within a chassis.
Though it's no Google or Amazon, Iliad provides a useful reference win for ARM server CPU vendors as they try to take share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), whose Xeon CPUs claim the lion's share of the server market, including most Web/cloud data center deployments.
Canaccord has forecast ARM server CPUs, still in their infancy, will grab a 20% share by 2018. Hyperscale data centers and application-specific server appliances are seen as areas where ARM-based solutions could stand out.
Intel is looking to head off the ARM threat both by developing low-power Atom server CPUs, maintaining a manufacturing process edge, and (notably) providing a variety of custom CPUs to Internet giants such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and eBay; the latest offerings are packaged with Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) FPGAs to provide on-the-fly programmability.
Nonetheless, Facebook's Open Compute Project supports both ARM and x86 CPUs, and Google has been reported to be thinking of building its own ARM chip.

Reuters reports Intel (INTC -1.7%) is ""close to announcing an investment"" in Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics, both of whom have been taken private by a P-E firm controlled by Beijing's Tsinghua University.
No details yet on the size of the stakes, or how much Intel is paying. Tencent Tech recently reported Intel is taking a 20% stake in Spreadtrum for $1.5B; given Spreadtrum was sold last year at a $1.78B valuation, that figure might be off.
Before being taken private, Spreadtrum was reporting strong sales growth for its low-cost 2G and 3G baseband modems, which have scored many Chinese phone design wins. The company also sells RF transceivers, and has rolled out a 4G baseband that supports China Mobile's TD-LTE 4G network.
Notably, Spreadtrum competes against Intel's Infineon baseband unit, which is trying to ramp its 4G baseband sales with the help of Samsung design wins. However, Intel is just 4 months removed from partnering with another low-cost Chinese competitor (app processor vendor Rockchip), as it tries to grab share from Qualcomm/MediaTek and narrow its large mobile losses. Both Spreadtrum and Rockchip rely on ARM CPU cores.
RDA sells a variety of telecom ICs. Its product line includes baseband chips, RF components, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips, set-top ICs, and satellite tuner chips.

As part of the deal, Intel will get a $300M grant over 5 years, and be eligible to pay a tax rate of just 5% for 10 years. Nearly 1K new workers will be hired for the plant by 2023.
Intel is a year removed from taking full control of Fab 18, a separate Kiryat Gat facility that was being used by Micron to make NOR flash memory. The company is expected to combine Fabs 18 and 28 into a facility that will produce CPUs based on Intel's next-gen 10nm process. Fab 28 currently makes 22nm CPUs.
Intel, intent on maintaining its manufacturing process lead over TSMC, Samsung, and Globalfoundries, plans to offer 10nm CPUs in 2016, courtesy of its Cannonlake architecture.

3rd-party servers based on IBM's Power architecture will hit the market in early 2015, says IBM exec Ken King. He adds the first Power systems will be aimed at cloud and high-end applications. They'll run on Big Blue's Power8 CPUs.
3rd-party Power CPUs are also expected in time. IBM first announced plans to license Power to third parties a year ago. The company's own Power server sales have been plunging amid a broader decline in UNIX and non-x86 server demand; they fell 28% Y/Y in Q2.
Early supporters for IBM's effort include Nvidia, Samsung, Micron, and most notably Google, which (like other Web giants) buys huge quantities of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs to power its servers. Power8's proponents claim big performance gains relative to Intel's x86 Xeon CPUs; individual Power8 chips can feature 12 cores and support up to 96 threads.
King says Google, known for its obsession with performance and power efficiency, could be intrigued by the fact Power can support more virtual machines than x86. As with the budding ARM server CPU market, software support will take some time.
Intel, whose server CPU unit towers over the market and is coming off a strong Q2, is trying to counter the Power/ARM threats both by rolling out new low-power Atom server CPUs, and by expanding its custom chip work for Internet clients. Upcoming products will offer more customization by placing an FPGA and a Xeon CPU in the same package.

While Intel has been steadily taking share from RISC platforms, IBM and Oracle have been busy refreshing their lineups over the last year.
AnandTech's benchmarks show major performance gains relative to prior-gen E7 CPUs. The site also notes the E7 v2 line supports more RAM than RISC alternatives, which could be very useful for some big data/analytics workloads.

Though reiterating an Outperform, FBR is skeptical about Intel's long-term 15% revenue CAGR target for its server CPU division. Bernstein questioned the division's growth outlook yesterday afternoon.

Goldman, reiterating a Sell (previous), says Intel's numbers ""confirm our view that there is downside, not upside, to Intel's 2014 EPS."" It's worried about both server CPU sales and a softening corporate PC upgrade cycle (driven by the Windows 7 transition) following Q1.

JPMorgan, which upgraded Intel going into earnings, is defending the company. It's pleased with stabilizing PC demand and dismisses server concerns, given sales have historically been volatile.
A major headwind faced by Intel's server CPU unit: Server industry revenues have been steadily declining, as demand shifts towards Web/cloud service providers with bigger economies of scale and a penchant for using cheap white-label hardware. IDC estimates total server sales fell 3.7% Y/Y in Q3, and that x86 server sales rose just 2.8%.

He thinks Intel's new management is ""more open to differing perspectives and is more attuned to market dynamics,"" and is looking to use its mobile processors to increase utilization rates (and thus margins).
At the same time, Covello believes Intel is better off focusing on its budding foundry business (where its manufacturing lead gives it an edge) than on mobile, and continues to think its ""core advantage is in segments that require high processing power,"" rather than low power consumption.

With ARM-based (ARMH +2.6%) CPUs currently having a minimal presence in the massive server CPU market, a report that Google is thinking of developing its own ARM-based server CPUs has gone over well with ARM investors.
In addition to Google, Facebook has shown an interest in ARM. A recent post from a Facebook developer suggests the company is working to port some of its internal software for use with ARM CPUs.
AppliedMicro (AMCC -4.6%), an early leader in the ARM server CPU space (courtesy of its X-Gene chips), wound up selling off after opening higher. There may be concerns Google will open-source its CPU designs to help foster a broader ecosystem for them, as it has done with many pieces of software.

Intel (INTC -0.7%), whose server CPU division had a $1.39B Q3 op. profit on the back of 12% Y/Y rev. growth, finished down modestly.

Goldman (Sell) isn't pleased with Intel's guidance for flat 2014 revenue/EPS growth, nor with its steep capex budget (~$11B).

Jefferies, however, is lifting its PT to $32. ""Intel's message was compelling: its product line is geared to the new market reality, PCs are stabilizing, servers are growing, and it expects to grow its tablet MPU shipments by 4x to 40m units in 2014.""

Goldman (Sell) sees AMD continuing to lose ground to Intel (INTC -0.2%), which has gained notebook share this year with the help  of its low-power Haswell parts, and only saw a 3% Y/Y drop in PC CPU  division sales in Q3 (vs. 15% for AMD). The firm thinks AMD has ceded  300 bps of share to Intel since Q1 2012. The arrival of Intel's Bay Trail Atom CPUs could further pressure AMD on the low-end; AMD is countering with Temash.
BofA/Merrill, which cut shares to Neutral, is worried PC weakness is going to offset console-related growth. CEO Rory Read predicted on the CC PC shipments will be down 10% both this year and next (IDC/Gartner aren't quite as pessimistic for 2014).
Wedbush (Outperform), on the other hand, thinks bad news is priced in, and estimates console-related sales surged to $401M in Q3, or 28% of revenue.

Digitimes' tablet OEM sources report Intel (INTC +0.3%) plans to launch ""entry-level"" Bay Trail Atom tablet CPUs in Q2 2014 expected to sell for just $15-$20. Current Bay Trail parts (just launched) go for $32 and $37, prior to a 10% volume discount.
The entry-level CPUs would be more cost-competitive with standalone ARM-based app processors from Qualcomm (QCOM +1%), Nvidia (NVDA +0.1%), and MediaTek, many of which go for $15-$20. If the report pans out, it suggests Intel is willing to further sacrifice ASPs and margins to grab mobile CPU share; as it is, current Bay Trail CPUs have spawned concerns about the cannibalization of Haswell notebook CPUs.
Digitimes previously reported Intel plans to launch several new mobile CPU lines in 2014/2015, including Bay Trail successors codenamed Cherry Trail (Q314) and Willow Trail (Q414 - that ETA seems aggressive).
Meanwhile, sell-side expectations for today's Q3 report are muted.

Rakesh now sees PC sales falling 10.7% Y/Y in Q4, worse than a prior forecast for a 9.6% drop. He also questions the ability of smartphone/tablet CPU sales to offset declining PC CPU sales for Intel, given notebook processors typically sell for several times as much as their mobile counterparts. Oddly enough (given Nokia's limited smartphone share), Rakesh also suggests the Microsoft-Nokia deal is a negative for the chip giant.
In August, IDC lowered its 2013 PC shipment growth forecast to -9.7% from a prior -7.8%. The firm estimates PC shipments fell 11.4% Y/Y in Q2 (Gartner is at 10.9%), and has predicted tablet shipments (aided by seasonality) will exceed PC shipments in Q4.
