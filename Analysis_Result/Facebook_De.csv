 Facebook's (FB -5.6%) plumbing new 2-year lows as the stock heads for its worst month in nearly five years, and angel investor Jason Calacanis for one thinks these are crisis times for the iconic social network. Looking at four stakeholders, he tells CNBC that advertisers still love the platform, but shareholders want out; employee morale is incredibly low and founders who sold their companies to CEO Mark Zuckerberg are sharply critical; and governments around the world may not put up with their ""democracies being compromised."" ""Put those four stakeholders together, this is a true crisis for Facebook,"" he says. ""It's possible, maybe not probable but possible, this could be their AOL peak, their Yahoo peak."" Those companies peaked with hundreds of millions of users (30M-plus paid users in AOL's case) and it took a decade or two for them to deprecate, he notes. ""Facebook's a whole different scale, 2.5B people, so I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon, and advertisers love it.""

Perhaps not a surprise, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) was one of the names that cropped up the most times in the portfolio updates (6 new buys/added stakes vs. 9 exits/reduced stakes).

The company's outlook turned off some investors, but Mahaney suggests the guidance was conservative and messaging monetization offers ""huge profit pools"" waiting to be uncovered.

 Facebook (FB -1.7%) is lower today amid a downgrade to Sell at Pivotal Research, which sees the rest of the Street underestimating risks including harbingers of ad spending slowdowns. The stock is ""simply too expensive,"" writes analyst Brian Wieser, who maintains a $140 price target, 17.5% lower than today's price. Wieser points to a digital ad market nearing saturation, with a nod to top advertiser Procter & Gamble and its cutbacks tied to inappropriate placements. The fact that P&G said $140M in reductions didn't impact revenue growth suggests large brands (from which he estimates Facebook gets 30% of revenues) may be more discerning on digital ad spending. Pivotal also says Europe's hard line on dominant companies like Facebook hints at more regulatory risk ahead, notably consumer privacy rules that take effect next spring.

Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) fell another 3.6% today, as the brutal selloff seen in response to the company's weak Q2 guidance (issued with Q1 results on Thursday morning) refused to end. Possibly contributing: Morgan Stanley joined the ranks of firms downgrading the Chinese mobile app developer. Credit Suisse and Macquarie downgraded on Friday.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) algorithm changes contributed to Cheetah's outlook. The company derives a large portion of its ad revenue (Credit Suisse estimates 25%-30%) from Facebook - it runs ads delivered by Facebook's mobile app ad network (the Audience Network), and also sells ads for clients on Facebook. Last fall, Facebook adjusted its algorithms to help advertisers know how ads are performing on 3rd-party apps, and it turned out ads on Cheetah's apps didn't perform well. The company has also implemented ad policy changes affecting Cheetah's ability to sell ads on Facebook.
After the bell, Cheetah announced a study done with Google's AdMob mobile ad unit (competes with Facebook's Audience Network) found the deployment of AdMob native ads provided a 400% revenue boost for Cheetah's Battery Doctor app during a test. In addition to AdMob, Cheetah is also counting on an ad partnership with Tencent to lower its Facebook dependence.

Facebook (FB -1%) has acquired Two Big Ears, a developer of software/technology for creating spatial audio for VR content and 3D audio for games. Terms are undisclosed.
Two Big Ears is now making its authoring tools, encoder, and rendering engine for ""cinematic VR and 360 [degree] video"" free. On the other hand, it's no longer offering its 3D game audio solution, but will instead work ""with the Oculus team to combine our expertise and create best in class VR audio.""
Oculus, less than two months removed from beginning shipments of its first commercial Rift headset - it costs $599, and needs to be paired with a PC sporting a powerful graphics card - is often seen as having an early hardware and software technology lead. But there's plenty of competition: HTC recently began shipping its Vive VR headset, and Sony's PlayStation VR headset (works with the PS4) will ship later this year. And last week, Google unveiled its Daydream VR platform, which will work with compatible Android phones and compete with Samsung/Oculus' $99 Gear VR headset (less powerful than the Rift).
In 2014, Oculus bought Nimble VR, a startup working on skeletal hand-tracking solutions, as well as 13th Lab, a startup working on technology to acquire and reconstruct 3D models in real-time.

 In a continuing competitive turn toward Google, Facebook (FB -1.1%) will now sell video ads for other companies for a cut of the revenues. In-network, Facebook usually takes about 30% of revenues and gives the rest to publishers, but the split for selling for other companies isn't specified. Facebook sells display advertising in its own network. Publishers can also decide to include video ads alongside content in its Instant Articles offering. “We think there are an awful lot of publishers looking for help monetizing their video,” says Facebook's Brett Vogel. Digital video ad spending is seen growing 28.5% this year to $9.84B by eMarketer. Facebook says viewers watch some 100M hours of video every day on its feeds.

The WSJ reports Facebook (FB -0.5%) is prepping a a standalone app dedicated to taking and sharing photos/videos. The app is said to open to a camera view (like Snapchat's app), and to support Facebook's new Live streaming service.
Sources caution the app is in its early stages, and might not launch. However, it would fit with two of Facebook's recent priorities: Halting a decline in user-generated content sharing, and driving Live adoption.
The Information recently reported (citing internal Facebook data) ""original broadcast sharing"" on Facebook was down 21% Y/Y in mid-2015, and about 15% earlier this year. Meanwhile, a Q1 GlobalWebIndex poll found 33% of Facebook users updated their status in the last month, and 37% uploaded or shared photos. Those numbers are down from 44% and 46% a year ago.
Facebook already has an app (called Moments) dedicated to sharing photos taken at group events. Many of the company's standalone apps - a list can be found on Google Play - have seen only modest success, even as the core Facebook app and Messenger continue seeing massive usage.

314,2016-04-15,-1.2,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

""It took 10 years to go from building the initial smartphone to reaching the mass market ... So I can’t imagine it would be much faster for VR,"" says Mark Zuckerberg (NASDAQ:FB) in a wide-ranging interview with Germany's Die Welt am Sonntag. ""I do think a new computing platform always emerges every 10 or 15 years. VR is currently the most promising candidate.""
Zuck adds Facebook is ""mostly interested in the software"" when it comes to VR - Oculus is seen as having an early edge here - but adds it's necessary for the same company to do both hardware and software in the early stages of a new platform's development. ""Only later does specialization become valuable.""
When asked why anyone should buy the Oculus Rift ($599 + the cost of a PC featuring a high-end GPU) over Samsung's $100 Gear VR headset, Zuck declared the former delivers a far superior experience. ""VR is a very intense visual experience and having the most powerful PC is the only way to deliver certain experiences ... You are playing Ping Pong or interacting with someone and the technology needs to be fast enough so that when you do something, it triggers and sends that action all the way across the Internet to someone else.""
Regarding artificial intelligence, Zuck predicted the technology will usher in an era of unsupervised learning. ""You have this model of how the world works in your head and you’re refining it to predict what you think is going to happen in the future ... A.I. will help us with this."" He also dismisses Elon Musk's concerns about A.I. potentially being a threat to humanity.
Separately, Re/code reports Zuck is ""obsessed"" with livestreaming, and that ""the engineering and product teams that work on video at Facebook"" have made the company's Live video streaming service their top priority.

His target has been cut by $3 to $22, matching the Street low.
Sena: ""Total minutes on the platform through November continue to fall in the mid-single digits domestically, while other social platforms demonstrate double-digit growth off of larger bases, with Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (CHAT) now 150% and 50% larger, respectively. This is in spite of multiple major product launches, including Moments as well as the partnership with Google. Although we do not have December data yet, the data through November suggests to us that the Street’s 325mm MAU estimate (or 5mm net adds, reflecting an acceleration from 4mm in 3Q) may be too optimistic, and we maintain our 323mm estimate.""
He adds the preference among advertisers for networks with more scale - Twitter appears to be attempting to address this by trying to monetize logged-out users - along with higher Twitter minimum ad spend requirements, are ""driving a sharp deceleration in revenue growth."" Moreover, Sena doesn't think 2016 Street EBITDA estimates reflect the traffic acquisition costs tied to off-network ad sales growth.

Initial supporters of the videos, which lend themselves well to Oculus-powered VR headsets such as the Rift and Gear VR, include ABC News, BuzzFeed, GoPro, and Nickelodeon. Facebook has also begun testing the sale of 360° video ads; buyers include AT&T, Samsung, Walt Disney World, and Nescafe.
The launch comes a week after Facebook disclosed it now gets over 8B daily views for its autoplay video ads, up from 4B in April, and that over 500M users are watching video daily; a dedicated video channel is in test mode. YouTube also supports 360° content. The online video giant has cautioned the videos can be significantly more bandwidth-intensive than standard material.
Separately, Facebook has officially launched its rumored Notify mobile push notification app. 70+ media partners are on board - initial content includes breaking news from CNN, end-of-game summaries from Fox Sports, and ""iconic"" imagery from Getty Images. Facebook isn't currently monetizing the app; rather, its main goal for now is to further add to its sizable mobile usage share.

Looking to make a splash at the Advertising Week conference (runs from Monday-Friday in NYC), Facebook (FB -4.5%) has announced a partnership with TV measurement leader Nielsen (NLSN -2.8%) to let advertisers run joint Facebook/TV ad campaigns using Nielsen's traditional target rating point (TRP) buying system.

The solution is initially launching for news feed video ads, and will arrive on Instagram in Q1 2016. It lets brands and agencies buy ads aiming to reach a certain % of a demographic group (a TRP) on TV and Facebook, with the option to buy a portion directly with Facebook. Nielsen's services verify ad delivery and compare performance with standard TV campaigns. Facebook claims 42 joint TV/ad campaigns yielded a 19% total increase in targeted reach relative to TV-only campaigns, and were twice as likely to hit their target audience.
Facebook exec Carolyn Everson: ""It's very much in many ways how TV [ads are] bought today where the advertiser or the agency can submit their budget and their reach goals and how many [gross rating points] they're looking to achieve.""
Along with the TRP-based solution, Facebook is launching ""brand awareness optimization"" tools meant to help advertisers target viewers likely to recall their ads, support for mobile advertiser polls, and support for videos within its carousel ad format. eMarketer estimates U.S. digital video ad spend will rise 33.8% this year to $7.8B, and 23.4% next year to $9.6B. YouTube remains the market's biggest player.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is bringing video ads to its mobile ad network (the Audience Network) for 3rd-party apps. Also arriving are the company's Dynamic Product Ads, which display images of products users have previously seen, and Carousel ads, which let users swipe through up to 5 images of advertised items.
Two video ad formats are supported: Native autoplay ads similar to the ones that appear in Facebook's news feed, and click-to-play ads that pop up on a screen. Facebook notes 80% of its Audience Network ad impressions now consist of native formats such as sponsored news feed posts.
RBC predicted in June video ads - they carry much higher ad prices than standard news feed ads - will account for over half of Facebook's ad sales over the long run. The company recently began allowing marketers to only pay for video ads that are viewed for at least 10 seconds.
Separately, Business Insider reports Facebook is working on an app that will push breaking news alerts from partner publications, with users selecting which publications they follow. The alerts would feature up to 100 characters, and a link to the related article on the publisher's site.
Such an app would indirectly challenge Twitter, which is used as a real-time news source by millions of its readers. Many of the non-core apps launched by Facebook, such as Snapchat rival Slingshot and Flipboard rival Paper, have only amassed modest user bases.

""For the next 4 qtrs, the Street pegs FB’s growth rate at 34%, whereas  at a similar revenue base, Google sustained 47% growth ... We are 4-5%  above Street ’15 Revenue and EPS estimates."" Central to that thesis is a belief several ""greenfield"" revenue opportunities, led by video and Instagram, will ramp tremendously. ""With varying levels of conviction, we have estimated the potential 2016 P&L impact from Autoplay Video Ads and Instagram to be $3.4B+ in incremental revenue and $0.40+ in incremental EPS. And we estimate the potential 2017 P&L impact from FB Messenger & WhatsApp to be $2.2B+ in incremental rev and $0.25+ in incremental EPS. Oculus Rift could have the potential to add a further $500MM+ to the topline in ‘17."" He adds survey work and channel checks indicate 54% of marketers are ""somewhat"" or ""very"" likely to buy Facebook video ads over the next 6 months, and that 72% are interested in spending on Instagram, which just significantly expanded its ad offerings. 
On CNBC, Mahaney added he thinks Facebook's autoplay video ad opportunity will be as big as its (non-video) mobile ad opportunity once was. ""[O]nly about 10 percent of the 500 advertisers that we surveyed are currently on there with video ads, but an additional 50 percent want to be on there ...

In addition, each Rift unit will ship with an Xbox One wireless controller and related PC adapter following the headset's commercial launch, which is set for Q1 2016. Spencer: ""We believe we’ll be able to create state of the art virtual reality experiences with the Oculus Rift on top of Windows."" (live blog)
The alliance indicates Microsoft will rely on Oculus (widely seen as having an early VR tech lead) to counter the 1H16 launch of Sony's Morpheus VR gaming headset. Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality headset (due later this year) will also support Xbox gaming.
The first commercial edition of the Rift has been officially unveiled. It features two OLED screens (one for each eye), an integrated/removable headphone, and a tabletop camera to track head movements.
For the time being, the Rift will require a PC to work. No word yet on pricing; Oculus has previously suggested it would like to charge $200-$400.

The well-connected Martin is seen as having pursued a relatively hands-off regulatory approach during his FCC tenure.
Facebook's stances on Web/telecom regulation have been complex: The company has joined Internet giants in backing tough net neutrality rules, but (through its Internet.org initiative) has also been trying to provide free mobile Web access to Facebook and other select services in emerging markets, a move that has sparked criticism from both neutrality advocates arguing the company is creating a ""walled garden,"" and carriers who think Facebook wants a free ride. Martin will presumably assist in tackling such challenges.
Following the neutrality criticism, Facebook has moved to make Internet.org an open platform any developer can provide services for, as long as it adheres to a handful of rules covering bandwidth restrictions, mobile optimization, and app openness.

On a day that it posted a Q1 sales miss (a little ahead of schedule) and cut its full-year guidance, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announces it's partnering with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DoubleClick unit (a giant in the display ad space) to allow Twitter advertisers using DoubleClick to ""measure when conversions result from views and other actions on Twitter.""
Notably, Twitter/DoubleClick plan to give advertisers ""a new attribution model in DoubleClick to get a fuller understanding of how Twitter Ads served on mobile or desktop drive conversions for them across the web."" That could point to the (anonymous) use of Twitter profiles to track ad conversions. Also: The companies plan to make Twitter ad inventory available through DoubleClick Bid Manager, a widely-used ad-buying platform supporting many online ad exchanges.
The addition of Twitter as a partner is a notable win for DoubleClick as it tries to fend off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which last fall launched a new version of its Atlas ad server/measurement platform that tracks the performance of ads seen by Facebook users both on its site/apps and others. Facebook is counting on its anonymous linking of user profiles with ad measurement to give it an edge against DoubleClick and other rivals relying on cookies.
Meanwhile, Twitter's Q1 CC (live blog) failed to cheer up investors. The company mentioned Q2 user growth is off to a ""slow start,"" and that ad click rates (CTRs) declined Q/Q in Q1 due to a mix shift towards formats with lower CTRs. Ad load was flat, and app install ads (a format Facebook has seen huge success with) underperformed.
On the bright side, CEO Dick Costolo noted more than 1M people signed up for Twitter's Periscope live-streaming app in its first 10 days, that the company has seen ""orders of magnitude"" more native video on its site following the launch of a 30-second video platform in January, and that it's working with Apple on a Spotlight search integration deal. CFO Anthony Noto stated Twitter will begin counting users of its SMS follow service (there are currently ~6M) as MAUs.

Facebook (FB -0.8%) hasn't received any downgrades after posting its first sales miss as a public company (while beating again on EPS) thanks to a strong dollar. At least 6 firms (perhaps reacting to the stock price more than earnings) have hiked their targets.

Many bulls are focusing on Facebook's huge video traffic growth. FBN: ""[T]he company had >4B video [views] per day in FQ1, up from >3B in FQ4 and >1B in FQ3. Moreover, mobile is a key driver here as over 75% of FB video [views] are done on mobile."" FBR notes video ad prices can be 10-20x display prices on a CPM basis, and expects ""ad tech investments in Atlas, LiveRail, and the FB audience network should grease the tracks to enable more video ads.”

Barclays thinks there ""may be significant upside to revenue given tailwinds on both [video] inventory and pricing."" SunTrust sees video, Dynamic Product Ads (allow advertisers to quickly promote products from their catalog to targeted users), and a Buy button all acting as 2015 growth drivers.
Pac Crest (Sector Perform), on the other hand, thinks Instagram and video won't be major 2015 revenue contributors. It also observes Q1 ""was the first quarter since early 2013 when total [ad] impressions grew sequentially and price per ad declined sequentially,"" which leads it to think the impact of the mobile shift and lower right-column ad inventory are mostly finished. On a Y/Y basis, impressions fell 62% and ad prices rose 285%. On CNBC (video), Alpha One Capital's Dan Niles says he sold Facebook into earnings on account of its run-up, but still calls it his favorite company.
On the CC (transcript), Facebook cut its 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP spending growth guidance on the high end by 5% to 55%-65% and 50%-60%, respectively. Also: While declining to promise Oculus will do a commercial launch this year (its VR headsets are still in beta), CFO Dave Wehner stated 2015 expense guidance ""reflects any volumes that we might do in 2015.""
Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, stated Facebook now handles over 1B daily mobile searches, that the average Instagram user spends 21 minutes/day on the service, and that Facebook handles over 45B messages/day across its platforms. Sheryl Sandberg noted Facebook/Instagram account for over 1/5 of all U.S. mobile time spent.

Over 40 apps are initially supported, including ESPN, The Weather Channel, Imgur, and a slew of independent content/media apps such as JibJab, PicCollage, and UltraText; an SDK rolls out today. Disclosed along the way: Messenger now handles 10% of all VoIP phone calls.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has bought TheFind, an online shopping search engine that lets users compare listings from Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, and many other online retailers/marketplaces - the startup claims to index more than 500M products across 500K stores. Terms are undisclosed.
While announcing the deal, TheFind says its search engine will be shuttered within the next few weeks, but adds it will be ""working hard to integrate our technology to make the ads you see on Facebook every day better and more relevant to you.""
A source talking to AdWeek states Facebook will use TheFind to deliver better retargeted ads (i.e. ads based on activity on non-Facebook sites/apps), something that could yield better ROIs and ad prices. ""Say you're looking at a pair of jeans on the Gap's website. You won't see those ads after you buy them.""
Facebook already does plenty of business selling retargeted e-commerce ads within its news feed, and on its site's right-hand column. However, delivering relevant product ads to consumers is still often a challenge, as it is for many other retargeted ad platforms.
The acquisition comes just a month after Facebook launched a news feed ad unit meant specifically for product ads, and for which ads are tailored to a user's activity and interests. The company has also been testing out a Buy button that could improve ad ROIs/prices by allowing users to make purchases without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using payment data previously saved to their accounts.

The mobile app -- made in partnership with local mobile phone provider Tigo  and aimed at low-income and rural users -- offers more than a dozen tools via the Android OS.
The total population in Colombia was 47 million people in 2014, of which 25% were living in rural areas.

348,2015-01-14,-0.17,Facebook at Work launches in test mode; $100+ targets arrive,"

Facebook at Work, first reported on by the FT in November, has been made available via app stores to select enterprise test partners. The platform looks a lot like standard Facebook (FB +0.4%) - it contains a news feed, messaging tools, and groups - and lets users log in with their regular Facebook accounts. But a user's professional data is completely split off from his/her personal data, and Facebook won't collect any of it.
Moreover, unlike LinkedIn (LNKD +0.1%), Facebook at Work is only focused (for now) on connecting with co-workers, thus arguably making it more of a rival to Jive Software (JIVE -0.3%), Salesforce's Chatter platform, and Microsoft's Yammer. LinkedIn and Jive both sold off following the November FT report.
With no ads being sold, corporate subscriptions are a potential revenue stream. Facebook can count on its giant, highly engaged user base to drive interest in Work. At the same time, it has to contend with corporate wariness towards Facebook, historically viewed by many of them as a productivity-killer.
Separately, Oppenheimer and Credit Suisse have respectively hiked their Facebook targets to $100 and $102. Oppenheimer expects a strong Q4 report on Jan. 28. ""Checks suggest 4Q pricing +14% q/q and +21% y/y, with same-client spending +32% q/q and 33% y/y ... Organic reach is becoming more difficult, due to competition for newsfeed impressions ... We also see upside from increased video adoption.""
Credit Suisse cites the potential of Facebook's mobile ad network, and argues ""Street models are too conservative and underestimate the long-term monetization potential of upcoming new products.""

Instagram (FB +0.6%) has surpassed 300M monthly active users (MAUs) less than nine months after topping 200M, and 15 months after surpassing 150M.
The mobile photo-sharing platform now has more MAUs than Twitter claimed at the end of Q3 (284M). It also has ~3x as many MAUs as Snapchat was reported to have in October.
Facebook had 1.35B total MAUs at the end of Q3, and WhatsApp, which Facebook finished acquiring early in Q4, topped 600M in August. Facebook's Messenger apps surpassed 500M in November, after the company unbundled messaging from its core apps.
Instagram adds over 70% of its users are now outside the U.S., up from 65% in March, and that shared photos have risen to 30B+ from 20B. In spite of the 50% MAU growth, average photo uploads/day have only risen to 70M from 60M (implies fewer uploads per MAU).

A backlash ensued; the latest version of the iOS app still has a rating of only 1.5/5 stars in the App Store due to users upset about the new requirement (its cumulative rating is 3/5 stars).Nonetheless, the requirement has led Messenger's MAU count to soar past that of all other mobile messaging platforms save for Facebook-owned WhatsApp (has over 600M), and grow to equal nearly 40% of Facebook's Q3-ending MAU base of 1.35B.Facebook put ex-PayPal chief David Marcus in charge of Messenger in June, and has suggested it plans to monetize the platform via payments.

Reuters reports the EU is set to unconditionally approve Facebook's (FB -0.5%) purchase of WhatsApp. The EU previously set an Oct. 3 deadline for its decision.
In spite of the partial overlap between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, regulatory approval has been widely expected, given competition from Line, Kakao, BlackBerry, Apple, Skype, and many others. Thanks to the rally in Facebook shares, the deal is now worth $22B ($18B in stock, $4B in cash).
Stifel's Scott Devitt (formerly at Morgan Stanley) has raised his Facebook target by $4 to $99 (a new Street high), citing the potential for rapid video ad growth. Devitt notes global digital video ad spend has been forecast to post a 29% CAGR from 2013-2018 (growing to $21.6B), and thinks Facebook can deliver 2016 video ad sales of $346M.
With usage boosted by Facebook's new (and controversial) requirement for mobile Messenger users to download a standalone app, GlobalWebIndex estimates the Messenger apps are now used by 38% of its tracked global audience.
Penetration rates are especially high in several major emerging markets, some of which are also big WhatsApp markets. India is at 57%, the Philippines at 59%, Mexico at 51%, and Brazil at 46%.

Outgoing CFO David Ebersman notes headcount rose 39% Y/Y in Q1, and expects GAAP costs/expenses will grow 35%-40% in 2014; GAAP growth was 32% in Q1, and non-GAAP growth 26%.

Google (GOOG -1%), which already offers app promotion/install ads for its AdWords search ad platform and AdMob mobile display ad network, has updated its offerings to allow marketers to target users based on app usage, as well as offer ads urging users to open apps they've already installed (but might be ignoring).
Much like Twitter's newly-launched app install ads, Google's revamped offering is aimed at Facebook (FB -2.4%), which drove 245M downloads last year via ads allowing developers struggling to get noticed within app stores to promote themselves on news feeds.
Google is also rolling out new reporting, automated bidding, and bulk-action tools for AdWords clients - the company calls them ""enterprise-class"" - and has confirmed it's testing the use of offline data to measure search ad effectiveness (previous).
Meanwhile, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum says his company has reached 500M MAUs - up from 450M in mid-February, when the Facebook deal was announced. Koum notes India (48M MAUs), Brazil (45M), Mexico, and Russia are WhatsApp's biggest growth drivers, and promises to keep its apps simple and uncluttered; some rivals have a different strategy.

As previously reported, the ads leverage Twitter's expandable card format. They also leverage Twitter's online ad-buying platform, and can be delivered on 3rd-party apps via MoPub's mobile ad exchange.
Twitter is looking to take a bite out of Facebook's (FB +0.1%) app install ad business, which has reeled in thousands of developers struggling to get recognized on the App Store and Google Play.

EU approval remains outstanding.
Though signing off on the deal, the FTC cautions WhatsApp needs to honor existing privacy commitments made to its users; EU regulators have raised privacy concerns of their own. Facebook settled an FTC privacy probe in 2012.
Facebook is giving back a big chunk of yesterday's gains as the Nasdaq turns in its ugliest day in years. Thanks to Facebook's recent selloff, the price tag for the WhatsApp deal has fallen by $1.4B to $17.6B.

Google (GOOG -0.4%) appears to have ""seriously sniffed around"" Oculus VR before Facebook (FB -3.8%) closed a deal to buy the VR headset maker, Kara Swisher reports. Meanwhile, The Verge reports ""several big companies"" had made overtures to Oculus (no names are given), and that the startup's VC investors ""offered the company more money to go it alone.""
Over time, Oculus' Rift headset, which Facebook hopes will be used for many non-gaming applications, could compete against Google Glass. For now, they address different markets: Rift is much heavier/bulkier than Glass, but also provides an immersive VR/3D gaming experience.
During a CC, Mark Zuckerberg asserted the Rift is ""way ahead"" of rival products such as Sony's (SNE -0.4%) Morpheus (due in 2015), and that Oculus' talent is unmatched. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe argues Facebook's resources will help make the Rift cheaper (the dev. kit currently goes for $350).

Stacy Higginbotham remains an Oculus skeptic: While calling a demo she tried out ""immersive and neat,"" she adds it was ""nothing like real life."" Brad Stone thinks ""there's nothing social"" about headsets that ""[blot] out absolutely everything around you.""

Jim Edwards, defending the deal, calls the Rift the kind of product for which words can't describe ""how incredible the experience of wearing one is."" VC Chris Dixon, who backed Oculus, makes a similar case.
Some game developers are unhappy about the deal. As are some of the Kickstarter backers who poured $2.4M into Oculus, and only have t-shirts and dev. kits to show for it. Facebook has joined several other Internet momentum stocks in selling off in the wake of King's disappointing IPO.

379,2014-03-19,-0.95,eMarketer: Mobile ads growing 75% in 2014; Google/Facebook to dominate,"

After growing 105% last year (soundly above a prior forecast of 79%) eMarketer sees global mobile ad sales rising 75% in 2014 to $31.45B.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to account for 46.8% of all that spending; that figure is slightly below 2013's 49.3%.
An ongoing challenge for Google: Web browsing accounts for only ~20% of smartphone usage, making Google's search ad hegemony less valuable on mobile than on PCs. Helping to offset: Google's AdMob unit remains a top mobile display ad player, and the company is making efforts to integrate mobile app content within search results.
eMarketer recently predicted mobile search would account for 26.7% of Google's 2014 U.S. ad revenue, up from 19.4% in 2013. Altogether, the firm sees Google's U.S. PC search revenue falling $770M this year, and its mobile search revenue growing $1.76B.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which saw its mobile ad sales rise 4x Y/Y in Q4 and make up 53% of its ad revenue, is expected to have a 21.7% mobile ad share, up from 17.5% in 2013.
Twitter's (TWTR - 75% of Q4 ad sales from mobile) shares is expected to rise to 2.6% from 2.4%. Pandora's (P - 72% of Q4 ad revenue from mobile) is seen falling to 1.7% from 2.1%, and Millennial Media's (MM - just expanded by merging with rival Jumptap) to 0.7% from 0.8%.

Facebook's (FB -2.8%) news feed video ads, delayed more than once due to user experience concerns, are 15 seconds long (on par with Instagram's video ads) and begin automatically playing without sound. Clicking/tapping on an ad leads it to expand and sound to begin.
Ad exec Brian Boland says Facebook is testing features that allow marketers to decide at what time of day an ad appears, how often it appears, and whom it reaches. Facebook is working with video ad analytics firm Ace Metrix to weed out low-quality ads.

Past reports have mentioned Facebook is looking to charge anywhere from $1M-$2.5M/day for video ads, depending on reach. At those prices, showing the company's 757M DAUs an average of even 2-3 video ads/day could yield a $1B+/year revenue opportunity.
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others are all moving aggressively to offer targeted video ad products to brand marketers, and in doing so take a bite out of a TV ad market expected to be worth $67B in the U.S. alone.
Facebook launched a video app install ad product last fall.

On a CPM basis, Facebook's ad prices rose 92% Y/Y in Q4, much faster than Q3's 42% clip and more than offsetting an 8% ad impression drop caused by the mobile shift.
News feed ads (account for the lion's share of Facebook's soaring mobile ad sales) generally carry higher prices than right-hand column ads, such as those delivered by the FBX Exchange (delivers targeted ads based on non-Facebook activity). FBX ad targeting and pricing remain a work in progress.

Pichai's remarks come shortly after Mark Zuckerberg met with top mobile carrier execs, including Vodafone (VOD -1.3%) CEO Vittorio Colao and Orange (ORAN -3.6%) CEO Stephane Richard, to address concerns carriers are being reduced to ""dumb pipes"" as services such as Facebook and WhatsApp proliferate, and in doing so eat into voice/SMS revenue.
Zuck is looking to enlist carriers such as Vodafone and Orange in its Internet.org initiative to provide free access to basic Web services in emerging markets. Colao recently said offering free Facebook access to Vodafone subs ""does not make any sense"" for the carrier.
Meanwhile, WhatsApp rival Telegram has rocketed to the top of App Store charts in many countries since the Facebook deal went down, and WhatsApp saw a weekend outage. Telegram claims to offer better security than alternatives, and also features a Snapchat-like self-delete option for message threads.

Instagram passed 150M MAUs in September.Mark Zuckerberg confirmed Facebook is interested in developing more standalone mobile apps. ""[We will] build a handful of great new experiences that are separate from what you think of as Facebook today.""

While Facebook's North American ARPU is at $6.03, its ARPUs for Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world are still only at $2.61, $0.95, and $0.84, respectively.CC live blogs: I, IIQ4 results, details, slides ",0.9885,positive,0.6727687058823529

Sheryl Sandberg later insisted overall U.S. teen Facebook usage remains stable. The bigger question for Facebook: Is softening engagement among teens in certain markets simply the result of teen-specific issues (for example, not wanting to engage with a social network one's parents and other older relatives are on), or a leading indicator of broader issues (e.g. boredom, privacy concerns) that could affect engagement among other demographic groups?

""The gap between ... two Facebooks (NASDAQ:FB) — the one its managers want to see, and the one its users like using today — is starting to become visible,"" writes AllThingsD's Mike Isaac in a report examining the social networking giant's efforts to evolve into a news/information hub.
But while Mark Zuckerberg wants his company to be ""the best personalized newspaper in the world,"" its users still largely see it as a place to keep in touch with friends/family and ""share a funny, viral story or LOLcat picture."" Viral, ""low-quality"" content often receives far more clicks than ""high-quality"" news pieces.
This disconnect has reportedly led Facebook to hold off on rolling out its media-heavy news feed overhaul (announced in March) to most users, and for engagement to stall among those users who have received the update.
An update amounting to ""a less drastic change"" is now reportedly being prepped. Ahead of that move, and in spite of the click rate data, Facebook has updated its news feed algorithm to show more ""high-quality"" stories.
Meanwhile, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), while still having a far smaller active user base, has evolved into a news hub for many of its users, and is trying to make the most of this status.
Isaac's report arguably drives home the challenges Facebook contends with as it tries to keep users (inc. younger ones) tiring of its traditional fare engaged, and without alienating the hundreds of millions of users content with the status quo.

""Well-placed sources"" tell Om Malik Instagram (FB -1%) is getting ready to launch ""private messaging features"" for its photo/video-sharing apps. Instagram is also said to be ""experimenting with the idea of group messaging."" The features are likely to be included in an app update expected by year's end.
Private and group photo messaging services would represent a challenge to fast-growing Snapchat, widely reported to have snubbed Facebook's M&A overtures. And Instagram, with 150M+ mobile MAUs, high engagement levels, and a solid cachet with younger social media users, is arguably a better platform for launching the features than Facebook proper.
But as the many mobile photo apps that have failed to slow down Instagram (in spite of adding filter support) can attest, it takes more than adding comparable features to steal a popular social networking/messaging platform's thunder. Last year, Facebook launched a Snapchat-like app called Poke, but it failed to gain much traction.

The comments are meant to calm growing worries Facebook's popularity is waning among younger U.S. users, and that this trend could have broader long-term implications for Facebook usage. Those fears have been amplified by Facebook's admission it saw a Q/Q drop in U.S. teen DAUs in Q3, and reports it made a rejected $3B+ bid for Snapchat.
Sandberg insists Facebook's news feed ad business can keep growing thanks to improved ad quality and targeting - new tools such as Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences are expected to help - even as Facebook refrains from any further major increases in news feed ad load.

The NYT has published a column discussing Facebook fatigue among younger users, and discussing the possibility of a future where ""where Facebook is no longer the default place on the web where people go to network.""
Among other things, the paper highlights Facebook's recent U.S. teen DAU decline, recent survey data, and the rise of Snapchat, which reportedly turned down a $3B+ buyout offer from Facebook.
It also reports some developers have said Facebook made an ""unusually aggressive"" pitch for their support at a recent event, and were less inclined to to partner with the company as a result. Facebook, aided by its acquisition of popular mobile/Web app development platform Parse, wants to become a de facto platform for consumer Web app development.

In its slide deck, Facebook notes its global ARPU rose 8% Q/Q and 33% Y/Y to $1.72 ($1.53 from ads, $0.19 from payments). However, the gap between the company's North American ARPU ($4.85) and its European ($1.96) Asian ($0.81), and rest of world ($0.67) ARPUs remains enormous.

Down as much as 4.7% earlier today, eBay (EBAY -2%) finished with losses only a little worse than the Nasdaq's after TechCrunch provided its own report about Facebook's (FB -0.3%) mobile payments product.
Like AllThingsD, TechCrunch reports Facebook's product won't offer payment-processing for now, but will rather focus on auto-filling billing info using data already provided to Facebook (the new Google Wallet functions in a similar manner).
But while AllThingsD argued Facebook's service amounts to a PayPal rival, TechCrunch argues this isn't the case, and that Facebook's primary goal is to collect data about user buying activity that could be used to improve ad sales/targeting. Facebook has already made some moves in this direction.
The truth may be in between. Though a lack of payment-processing (for now) prevents Facebook's offering from being a soup-to-nuts PayPal alternative, a product that allows billing info to be quickly auto-filled could still lead to more mobile transactions being processed by PayPal rivals.

However, for now, the test is focused on simply ""creating a better mobile checkout experience,"" and doesn't tie in payment-processing (as PayPal does).
Facebook already handles payments for in-app game purchases and its Gifts product (among other things), and the enormous reach of its social sharing tools could allow it to quickly reel in many 3rd-party apps and (if it chooses to expand further) Web sites.
But PayPal has stared down competition from Internet giants before, and the network effects stemming from its 132M active users and many thousands of merchant partners make it a tough company to seriously disrupt. PayPal expects to handle $20B in mobile transactions this year, up from $14B last year.

Facebook (FB -2.3%) has bought Mobile Technologies, developer of iOS/Android voice recognition and text translation apps (called Jibbigo) covering 25+ languages. Facebook says it will support MT's apps ""for the time being,"" but its clear goal is to integrate the startup's underlying technology into various Facebook apps.

Google and Apple, needless to say, are making their own big investments in voice recognition and (in Google's case) machine translation.
Facebook discloses its Indian monthly active users rose another 5% in Q2 to 82M. In its Q2 earnings slides, Facebook noted 39M of the 45M MAUs it added in Q2 came from Asia or the Rest of World segment. Only 6M came from the higher-ARPU North America and Europe segments.

OpenTable (OPEN +3.9%) and Rovi (ROVI +1.4%) have spiked higher after Facebook (FB -0.5%) announces companies will be able to take OpenTable reservations and display Rovi TV listings data on their Facebook pages.
OpenTable has integration deals with 600+ sites/services. They currently account for 5%-10% of the company's monthly booked restaurant seats.
Facebook has made several moves in recent months (I, II) to improve the quality of the local content/services provided by its mobile site and apps. Yelp (YELP -1.2%) has sold off more than once thanks to those moves, but the company is still differentiated from Facebook (and other rivals) via the breadth of its local reviews database.
OpenTable's Facebook deal comes at a time when the company is seeing fresh competition from Yelp (remains a partner for now) and Groupon. It also comes shortly after OpenTable began testing a payments system for its restaurant bookings.
