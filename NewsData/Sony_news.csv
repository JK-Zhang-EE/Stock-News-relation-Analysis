1,Australia drags Sony into court over digital game refunds,"Wed, May 29, 11:31 AM","
 Australian regulators have started Federal Court proceedings against Sony (SNE -1.9%), alleging the company misled customers of its PlayStation store. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission says Sony Europe consistently told customers it wouldn't refund games (even if faulty) if they had already been downloaded from the store, or if 14 days had elapsed since purchase. That violates Australian laws on refund/repair/replacement that the ACCC says apply to digital purchases as well as physical ones: ""Consumers who buy digital products online have exactly the same rights as they would at a physical store,"" it says. The ACCC also objected to refunds being given in store credit rather than original payment.  "

 Videogame sales eked out an overall gain in April as a strong software showing made up for another year-over-year decline in hardware sales. Reversing course from last month's drop, overall sales rose 1% to $842M, according to NPD Group. Software sales rose 15% to $427M, while accessories and game card spending rose 5%, to $256M.

8,Sony up 8% with surprise profit despite slowdown warning,"Fri, Apr. 26, 12:39 PM","
 Sony (NYSE:SNE) is up 8%, a top gainer today after beating earnings expectations with a bounce back to profit, despite warning of a slowdown ahead and pulling several projections out of uncertainty. Demand for games were a lift this quarter at least, as well as a gain in its stake in Spotify, and strength in semiconductors, offset somewhat by continuing woes in mobile phones. It swung to a profit of ¥87.9B (about $787M) vs. a year-ago loss of ¥13.3B, on revenues that rose 9% to ¥2.13T. But the company expects a sharp drop in annual profits, and the upcoming end of the PlayStation 4 life cycle looks like it may sting. Sony pulled medium-term profit targets for its electronics and entertainment units out of uncertainty. It had just set those targets less than a year ago. Considering a major music acquisition, ongoing losses in mobile, and big growth in game software, ""we thought that perhaps it would be a bit misleading to discuss only the 2020 fiscal year,” says CFO Hiroki Totoki. Sony expects gaming operating profits will fall by 10% for the fiscal year. And while its Xperia phone business lost ¥41.1B this quarter, it's merging with the other electronics businesses, in a unit now projected for an operating profit of ¥121B this fiscal year (up 58%).

At Stadia launch, he says it will offer 4K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR and surround sound, and notes future plans to offer 8K resolution at 120 frames per second -- all via the stream. 1:28 p.m.: The Stadia solution will offer 10.7 teraflops of GPU power, Bakar says -- vs. 6.0 for Xbox One X (NASDAQ:MSFT) and 4.2 for PlayStation 4 Pro (NYSE:SNE), more than the two consoles combined. 1:56 p.m.: Development hardware has gone out to more than 100 shops, Harrison says, and more than 1,000 creatives are working with it to build something for the platform already.

 Adding to recent videogame stock doldrums, industry sales tracked by NPD Group fell 19% Y/Y in January. That's a bit of a pullback after videogames' best December in four years. Overall sales fell to $893M from $1.1B a year ago, according to the firm, with broad spending declines. Hardware dropped 28% to $199M; software spending fell 18% to $427M; and accessories and game cards dropped 12% to $267M. The best-selling hardware platform in dollar and unit terms for January was the Nintendo Switch (NTDOY +0.7%). It was the only console platform to grow year-over-year, analyst Mat Piscatella notes. Minor gains in gamepad spending were offset by drops across other accessories and game cards. Meanwhile, Switch software grew by double digits but was offset by heavy declines across all other platforms. The dollar sales chart was topped by a few new releases, led by Kingdom Hearts III (OTCPK:SQNNY), followed by Resident Evil 2 (CCOEY -0.1%) and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe (OTCPK:NTDOY). Those three came in ahead of fourth-ranked Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (ATVI -2.1%). Rounding out the software top 10: No. 5, Super Smash Bros.

130,"Jefferies: This upcoming film could serve as Nvidia, AMD catalyst","Mar. 12, 2018, 10:26 AM","
        Jefferies reiterates a Buy rating on Nvidia (NVDA +3%) with a $300 price target (a 22% upside to Friday’s close) and calls Steven Spielberg’s upcoming “Ready Player One” film a potential catalyst. The film hits U.S. theaters on March 29.               Characters in the film, which is based on a popular book, escape from a dystopian society using virtual reality. Jefferies thinks this could drive VR headset sales and the headsets involve high-performance chips.                But analyst Mark Lipacis does see other benefits to Nvidia: “The computing paradigm experiences a tectonic shift every 15 years, and that it is currently in a shift to a 'Parallel Processing – Internet of Things' model. A lot of the demand for increased compute cycles is becoming parallel in nature, like neural networking, gaming, virtual reality and blockchain/cryptocurrency mining.""                And Nvidia isn’t the only company that would benefit from a VR headset boom. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD +0.5%) could become another chip winner.

 Shares in Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX +3.6%, FOXA +3.4%) are jumping as CNBC's David Faber says the company's closing in on a deal to sell assets to Disney (NYSE:DIS) that could be announced next week.

That's because of a better strategic fit and fewer regulatory problems for Disney, vs. a cavalcade of other suitors linked to possible purchases: Comcast (CMCSA +4.9%), Verizon (VZ +0.9%), Sony (SNE +0.5%), and even Amazon.com (AMZN -2.5%).

A deal (for Fox's film and TV studio assets, as well as a stake in Sky (OTCPK:SKYAY), all worth some $50B) would mean Fox CEO James Murdoch could join Disney. Sky shares gained 2.3% in U.S. trading today. A suitor buying Fox's 39% stake in Sky would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest of it under UK takeover rules.  "

Execs Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg were responsible for a range of popular shows including “Breaking Bad,” “The Blacklist,” “Rescue Me,” and perhaps most notably, “The Crown,” which is distributed by Netflix.                   The execs join Apple as co-heads of video programming, under SVP Eddy Cue and backed by the company’s $24B services business, which right now mostly amounts to iTunes and music streaming. CEO Tim Cook wants to double that segment revenue by 2020.                   Original content can keep Apple competitive with the successes of Amazon and Netflix exclusives and draw buyers to Apple TV.                Apple has slowly rolled out some original programs including a recently released “Shark Tank” inspired app developer competition show called “Planet of the Apps”, which received mixed reviews.  A streaming version of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” was also announced.   "

Hollywood studios are getting ready upend decades of tradition by making movies available at home less than 45 days after their big-screen release, writes Ben Fritz at the WSJ. The only question for so-called premium video-on-demand is when and on what terms it starts, not whether it happens, says Fritz.By year-end, films will likely be available just a few weeks after their theatrical debut for $30-$50.Among those who have publicly pushed for premium VOD are the chiefs at Time Warner (TWX, T), and 21st Century Fox (FOX, FOXA), while Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Jeff Shell - who runs Universal Pictures - has been a key voice behind the scenes.""Major studios and exhibitors are trying to work out how to respond to consumer desires so they can remain competitive,” says the former head of Sony's (NYSE:SNE) motion picture group.Paramount (VIA, VIAB) attempted premium VOD a couple of years back, but exhibitor opposition stifled the effort. The studio execs now would prefer to reach a deal with theaters, rather than roll out the new policy on their own.In the face of unified studio pressure, the theater chains appear open to the idea. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is #1; Regal Entertainment (NYSE:RGC) #2. One way to bring them along would be giving them a share of premium VOD revenue.Behind all this is the pressure being applied by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which streams its original films the same day they open in theaters, and is moving aggressively into feature films - including outbidding studios for projects with the likes of Will Smith, Brad Pitt, and Ridley Scott, and talking with Martin Scorsese about a $120M DeNiro-Pacino flick.

 Ahead of the launch of a live TV service, Hulu has cut the price of its ad-supported programming tier to $5.99/month from $7.99/month.

 Sony (SNE +3%) is close to a major motion-picture team-up with China's Dalian Wanda Group, the ambitious owner of the world's largest group of film theaters, Deadline Hollywood says. Details are in flux but could include film financing (particularly for tentpole films that perform well in China) as well as marketing cooperation, the report said. Sony, with a spotty track record at the box office in the past couple of years, could find an easier entree to China in such a deal. Wanda is that country's largest exhibitor. Wanda, controlled by China's second-richest man, has made no secret of its wish to invest heavily in the movie business. It's worked on the exhibition side to buy Carmike Cinemas and combine it with AMC Entertainment Holdings, and it bought producer Legendary Entertainment for $3.5B earlier this year. A near-plan to buy 49% of Paramount Pictures for around $4B was squelched in the drama at Paramount owner Viacom.

 Videogame sales ticked up Y/Y, rising 1% as key new game releases reversed a trend of declines, according to NPD Group. Spending had been falling against tough comparisons with last summer's releases. But a strong release schedule, including a new year's Madden NFL and a high-profile release in No Man's Sky, rescued August from summer doldrums. Overall sales rose to $573.4M as a pickup in software slightly more than offset continuing declines in hardware and accessories. Hardware sales continued a downward trend, coming on the cusp of a console refresh cycle at Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Those revenues fell 6% Y/Y to $178.1M. ""The unit growth in sales for the Xbox One and the 3DS was not enough to offset the decline in spending on the PS4, Wii U and older consoles,"" says NPD's Sam Naji. ""The decline in unit spending was also compounded by the 7 percent decline in the ARP for consoles and a 22 percent decline in the ARP for portables.” Videogame software spending, including digital estimates, grew 8% to $273.7M. And PC game sofware rose 18% to $14.2M. Meanwhile, accessory spending dropped 5% to $107.4M. In individual games (ranked by dollar sales), new releases took the spotlight: Madden NFL 17 (NASDAQ:EA) topped the chart, followed by No Man's Sky (SNE) and Deux Ex: Mankind Divided (Square Enix). Grand Theft Auto V, a cash cow at Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO), was No. 4, followed by Overwatch (NASDAQ:ATVI).  "

The latest Star Trek film showed a decline from the last entry (Star Trek Into Darkness) but logged $59.6M for a easy first place, outgrossing the $29.3M The Secret Life of Pets (CMCSA, in its third week) and the $21.6M scared up by Ghostbusters (SNE -2%). Two other debuts hit the $20M mark: Horror-thriller Lights Out (TWX +0.3%) drew $21.6M, and Ice Age: Collision Course (FOX -0.4%, FOXA -0.3%) a worse-than-expected $21M. The Secret Life of Pets fell off 42% but brought its cumulative take to over $260M.

317,Videogame spending declines 26% as hardware falls off,"Jul. 22, 2016, 10:18 PM","
 Videogame spending fell 26% Y/Y in June, facing tough comparisons against strong launches in 2015 and with hardware making up most of the decline, according to NPD Group data. Overall spending was $652.2M. Videogame hardware spending came to $181.5M -- down 42% as unit sales fell 32% and prices on average dropped 15%, the firm said. NPD Group has begun adjusting its report to include point-of-sale info for digital game sales made via PlayStation Network, Xbox Store and Steam, to reflect a fast-growing portion of industry revenues. That means for now that Nintendo sales and mobile sales, as well as other PC stores like EA's Origin, are missing and not projected. In software, both videogame and PC game software fell 20%, though last June featured strong launches like Batman: Arkham Knight. Overall sales (now including digital formats) came to $322M for consoles/portable and $27.8M for PC games including Steam. Accessories fell 6%, and interactive gaming toys (the lead accessory type) fell by 21%, mitigated somewhat by a 6% growth in headsets/headphones. In individual games (now ranked by dollar sales), despite the tough comps May launches had a good second month. Overwatch (NASDAQ:ATVI) continued to top the chart, followed by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens (NYSE:TWX). The inclusion of digital full-game sales gave GTA V a new boost. PlayStation 4 (NYSE:SNE) again was the top-selling console, over Xbox One (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Wii U (OTCPK:NTDOY).  "

 Like it or not the huge success of Pokémon Go is likely to unleash a huge pop in mobile games designed around augmented reality. There is already an online petition asking for a similar Harry Potter Go game to be designed and many more mainstream characters are sure to start showing up in games linked to the cameras on smartphones and tablets. Companies stocked with an arsenal of appealing characters that could be brought into augmented reality games include Disney (NYSE:DIS), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS).

Many retailers and restaurant chains have already been active in trying to latch on to the Pokémon Go buzz (see What's McDonald's doing inside the Pokémon code?), while GameStop (NYSE:GME) thinks it has an angle on the collectibles and accessories side. As the retail sector works out the science of in-game marketing opportunities, even more opportunities could arise. Technology firms with a stake in augmented reality include Google (GOOGL, GOOG) , Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

 The U.S box office is only up 1.3% through the 4th of July weekend compared to last year, according to an updated tabulation from BoxOfficeMojo.

 Britain's exit from the EU is having far-reaching impacts on a wide number of industries and investments -- and while not vital, the film industry is no exception. Hollywood's generally had a strong relationship with Great Britain, Scott Roxborough and Alex Ritman note, but ripples of the move (particularly in currency and financing) are reaching far and wide. The pound -- down more than 8% to a 30-year low against the dollar -- has a bit of a mixed effect. While shooting in London gets cheaper, British box-office revenues will shrink as well (assuming the proceeds are repatriated). A bigger impact could come from threatened British production tax credits (of 25%), part of what has Disney (NYSE:DIS) shooting Star Wars and Marvel movies there. And legal complications tied to a tricky continental divorce present a headwind for any independent production. Meanwhile, HBO (NYSE:TWX) says the vote result won't hurt its crown jewel Game of Thrones, partly filmed in Northern Ireland. That show got support from the EU's European Regional Development Fund earlier on, but not in the past few seasons. It does continue to get funding from the UK.

Sony's (NYSE:SNE) anticipated PlayStation VR headset (once known as the Morpheus) will cost $200 less than the Oculus Rift, which is due to begin shipping this month. While the Rift requires a PC with a high-end GPU and can play Xbox One games streamed to Windows 10 PCs, the PlayStation VR naturally works with the PS4 (36M+ units sold to date).
The VR sports a 5.7"" OLED display with a 1920 x RGB x 1080 resolution and 120Hz. refresh rate. It supports 360-degree motion tracking (enabled by 9 LEDs) and a 100-degree field-of-view, and has a latency of less than 18 milliseconds. The headset can be used with the PS4's DualShock 4 controller or the PlayStation Move's controller.

Sony expects 50 VR-capable games to be released between the device's October launch and the end of 2016. The list will include Star Wars: Battlefront and Valkyrie.

352,Sony to buy out Michael Jackson estate from music publisher for $750M,"Mar. 14, 2016, 7:58 PM","
 In a turn, Sony (NYSE:SNE) is going to acquire the other half of Sony/ATV Music Publishing -- the world's biggest music publisher -- from the estate of pop star Michael Jackson, for $750M. 
In October, Sony seemed ready to sell off its half of the business -- thought to be worth $2B overall at the time, though Sony would have had to give the Jackson estate a chance to counter any offers. Sony triggered a buy-sell clause in the partnership at that time. Sony/ATV has a huge catalog that holds most of the Beatles' songs, along with those by the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift. Michael Jackson's publishing rights and master records, however, aren't included, and the estate keeps its stake in EMI Music Publishing. Sony and Jackson had jointly owned the company equally since 1995; Jackson died in 2009. Sony and the estate entered a memorandum of understanding involving a lump-sum payment of $733M along with previously committed distributions. The two expect to have a definitive deal by March 31; it's not expected to be material to the fiscal year ending then, and Sony is evaluating impact to the fiscal year ending next March 31.  "

It will have more than 50 cable channels in the starter package.

 Revenues at Sony Pictures rose 28% to $2.18B, chiefly from theatrical revenues. Home entertainment declined slightly, as the previous year benefited from home sales of 22 Jump Street and The Equalizer.
 It's seeing lower overhead than before as well, thanks in some part to smaller incentive compensation. Music generated ¥27.4B ($228M) in operating profit based on hits from Adele and One Direction. Companywide, operating income was up 11% to ¥202B ($1.69B).

Within weeks, though, the CDC reversed course. It no longer recommended caution, and deleted a passage specifically addressing potential risks for children.
Mainstream scientific consensus currently holds that there is little to no evidence that cellphone signals raise the risk of brain cancer or other health problems. Nevertheless, more than 500 pages of internal records obtained by NYT, along with interviews with former agency officials, reveal a debate and some disagreement among scientists and health agencies about what guidance to give as the use of mobile devices skyrockets.

 Hollywood has capped off a record year of just over $11B at the box office -- with a little help at the end from some Star Warriors -- and the spoils aren't evenly divided between studios, as Universal has pulled off a historic hit year. A boost from Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its record-smashing performance pushed receipts past the $10.9B previous record, from 2013, by 1.5%. The $11B-plus was up 7.3% Y/Y.
With final numbers still coming in, admissions look flat, but higher ticket prices are providing a revenue boost. Universal (CMCSA -0.4%) and Walt Disney (DIS -1.1%) drove the year with dominating performances, while Paramount (VIA +1.7%, VIAB +0.9%), Fox (FOX -0.4%, FOXA -0.4%), Sony (SNE -0.4%) and Lions Gate (LGF +0.1%) all declined Y/Y. Universal's performance came from several of the year's biggest hits, notably Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions, Pitch Perfect 2 and Fifty Shades of Grey. For its part, aside from an in-progress record push by Star Wars (about to surpass Jurassic World's domestic gross), Disney also put Avengers: Age of Ultron and Inside Out into the year's top five. Both of those drew more than $350M at home.

The EC accused the firms of creating improper movie licensing deals blocking users outside the UK and Ireland (thus, most of Europe) from getting to paid Sky programming. Related clauses in the deals block other broadcasters from making pay TV available in the UK and Ireland. Meanwhile, the EC is pursuing a market less fragmented by border restrictions. Heavy fines could await all involved; the EU could fine companies up to 10% of global annual revenue. Disney pledged in the summer to fight vigorously. A closed-door hearing is set for Jan. 18-19.

Most all games on Apple TV are controlled by the device's slender remote. But the Nimbus controller made by SteelSeries (specifically for Apple's device) features analog sticks and D-pads familiar to console gamers, and sells for $50 (but at a $15 discount in the Infinity 3.0 bundle). Disney's entry in the toys-to-life category has underperformed compared to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders -- also now on Apple TV -- but the combination of content brands that Disney can leverage for the free-form game, including Marvel and Star Wars, has kept hopes high for the platform.

 As expected, hits returned to the box office this weekend after a few weeks of drought, with Bond beating Brown (... Charlie Brown). 
Spectre (SNE -0.7%) drew $73M to become the second-biggest debut in the James Bond series, behind 2012's Skyfall, which scored $88M in its opening. After an early opening overseas, Spectre is strong internationally with $200M this weekend and cumulative numbers that topped $300M. Spectre has a bit of a haul to profitability, though, as its production budget hit $250M. Meanwhile, The Peanuts Movie (FOX -2%, FOXA -2.1%) won by counterprogramming for families, scoring $45M, with 38% of the audience under 18 and giving positive word of mouth. Fox's The Martian, which marked a number of weeks at the top against weaker fare, grossed $9.3M to hold third place ($197.1M in six weeks) while Sony's Goosebumps got $7M for fourth ($66.4M cumulative) and Bridge of Spies (DIS distributing) $6.1M for fifth ($55M cumulative). Coming after the worst week of the year, this weekend likely puts the film industry back on track for the first ever $11B year in domestic box office.  "

 Ahead of earnings coming this afternoon, Walt Disney (DIS -0.8%) has signed an agreement with Sony's PlayStation Vue (SNE -0.5%) to bring Disney networks to the streaming video service. The deal (which doesn't yet have a launch date) includes the company's major channels as well as smaller ones -- ESPN, ABC TV, Disney Channel, Fusion, the Longhorn Network -- and an ""extensive"" on-demand library of Disney content. Disney's programming was a glaring omission when the Vue service launched in March, offering some 50 channels for $50/month, though Sony said it was continuing to work on content deals at that time. In contrast to Disney's deal with Sling TV, the pact with Vue allows for multiple simultaneous streams in a household -- likely a dealbreaker issue considering the volume of children's content. It also follows on Disney's trial balloon of its DisneyLife subscription service in the UK.

Techno Systems Research estimates Sony had 40% of the 2014 image sensor market, up from 35% in 2013. OmniVision had 16%, and Samsung 15%. Both the mobile and automotive markets have lifted broader image sensor demand, while consumer interest in high-quality front and rear smartphone cameras has propped up ASPs.

Software sales fell just 3% by comparison, to $465.6M. Accessory sales rose again. In new games at retail, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (OTCPK:KNMCY) couldn't unseat either NBA 2K16 (NASDAQ:TTWO) or Madden NFL 16 (NASDAQ:EA), which finished September with a one-two punch, and settled at third place, just ahead of FIFA 16 (EA).

News in the automobile industry this week continues to indicate seismic changes are coming.

The Silicon Valley factor: A deeper commitment by Apple and Google in the automobile sector is widely anticipated, although an all-in bet on the manufacturing side is still considered a reach. Key acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures in software, self-driving technology, and infotainment systems could sort out the winners from the losers. German players BMW (BAMXY) and Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF) could be in the mix.

The Sergio factor: Though the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) CEO continues to make some bold projections on the powerful merger synergies a tie-up with General Motors (NYSE:GM) would create, his math works for other combinations within the industry as well. Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), Tata Motors (NYSE:TTM), Honda (NYSE:HMC), and Volvo (OTCPK:GELYF) are each struggling in various markets.

The Tesla factor: Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) has engaged in a war of words with Toyota (NYSE:TM) in the electric vs. hydrogen debate. The EV automaker is also in a race with General Motors and Nissan over developing a mass-market EV with the driving range and sticker price to sell at scale. There's also been a tug-of-war over employees with Silicon Valley counterpart Apple. With so many enemies, some analysts think Tesla needs more friends in the space. Who has the ~$40B-$50B to buy out Elon or the moxie to strike a strategic partnership?

They run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 processor.
Huawei, trying to make greater high-end inroads, has launched the Mate S, a 5.5"" phone with a 1080p display, metal body, and 13MP camera with optical image stabilization. It will retail for a steep €650 ($728).
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) is going off the beaten path. The company has launched the Phab and Phab Plus, two near-7"" devices whose size arguably makes them tablets more than smartphones. Also launched: The Vibe P1, a phone with a 5"" 1080p screen and massive 5,000mAh battery; the Vibe P1m, which has a 5.5"" 720p screen, and a relatively modest 4,000mAh battery; and the Vibe S1, which has two front cameras to enable selfie shots with depth effects.
Meanwhile, Lenovo's Motorola Mobility unit has refreshed its Moto 360 smartwatch lineup. 42mm and 46mm men's versions are offered, along with a 42mm women's version. The watches sell for $300-$430.

Straight Outta Compton (CMCSA -0.5%) became the first film to top the box office three weeks in a row since Jurassic World pulled that off in late June, and it overcame a surprising challenger along the way: low-budget Christian film War Room  (SNE +0.5%).

Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation (VIA -0.1%, VIAB +0.7%) drew $8.3M to finish third, and Owen Wilson thriller No Escape $8.29M for fourth. Aside from War Room and No Escape, the other key debut -- We Are Your Friends with Zac Efron (TWX -0.9%) -- tanked with just $1.8M from 2,333 screens. Overall, total box office was down more than 20% Y/Y -- but against a difficult comp, with an earlier Labor Day holiday in 2014.  "

 How much are Disney and (especially) Comcast's Universal dominating the box office this summer (and, along with that, the year)? Enough that the two studios have combined for 61% of domestic ticket sales since the first Friday in May. With a few weeks left until Labor Day, the summer grosses in North America could come to $4.4B, an all-time record. The two studios have just over 47% of market share for 2015 to date, and seven of the year's top 10 grossing films. Warner Bros. (NYSE:TWX) is the best of the also-rans, with 14.3% share of the summer box office and 16.7% of 2015. But a relative lack of summer success from Fox (FOX, FOXA), Paramount (VIA, VIAB), Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Lionsgate (LGF) presages a tough fall ahead for most. Disney's scores have come with just eight films this year, vs. Universal's 12 and Warner's 17. Paramount had just two films out this summer. Lionsgate's only two summer films are Shaun the Sheep and this weekend's American Ultra, though it can look ahead to the final film in its Hunger Games series due in November. Disney (NYSE:DIS) is up 6.2% YTD (and was up 29% for 2015 until this month's media meltdown); Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is up 0.6% YTD (and was up 12% at its late-July high point).

 Video game spending was up slightly Y/Y in April, gaining 3% to $595.7M, paced by a 13% increase in physical software sales, according to industry trackers NPD Group. That's apart from mixed results in hardware sales -- which were up 12% in unit terms, but declined 4% on a dollar basis to $183.9M, after a round of console price cuts. Physical software rose to $256.7M. This month, violent games took the spotlight, with ""Fatality""-friendly Mortal Kombat X (NYSE:TWX) the new game topping the chart. It was followed by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Battlefield: Hardline (NASDAQ:EA). MLB 15: The Show (NYSE:SNE), another new game, came in at the fourth spot, just ahead of Minecraft.

 Time was when the summer movie season began Memorial Day weekend ... then Avengers: Age of Ultron (NYSE:DIS) set up for May 1, and pulled a whole lot of box-office money forward into the spring. The sequel drew $187.7M to mark the second-biggest domestic opening ever. The film fell short of what some observers though would be the all-time record: topping The Avengers' $207.7M opening in 2012. A tough major-sports Saturday might have hurt the take, as Age of Ultron had a stellar $84.5M Friday before tailing off to $57.2M Saturday. The new Avengers is a worldwide success with $627M in its 12 days out. Speaking of blockbuster season's earlier appearance, Furious 7 (CMCSA +0.6%) just took the month of April for its high-octane self but finally yielded to the Disney blockbuster as well as second-week release The Age of Adaline, (LGF) which took the No. 2 spot with $6.3M. 
Furious 7 drew $6.1M to bring its domestic take to $330.5, and $1.4B on a worldwide basis (fourth-most ever). Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (NYSE:SNE) was No. 4 with $5.4M ($51M total), while Home (NASDAQ:DWA) pulled $3.3M to bring its total to $158.1M.

 Confirming some industry speculation, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) was close to buying Starz (NASDAQ:STRZA) when the two entered a stock-swap deal in February -- and it fizzled in part because of Starz' valuation, The Wrap's Jon Erlichman writes. John Malone (Starz' biggest shareholder) got a board seat at Lions Gate and Starz got 3.43% of LGF in trade for 4.5% of Starz. But Malone reportedly wanted to make a deal, and Starz had talked with Viacom (VIA, VIAB) Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Fox (FOXA, FOX) last fall, Erlichman says. Starz reports earnings tomorrow and any buyer will have to pony up more now than last September: Shares are up more than 30% from their lowest point then, to $38.60 today. If Starz' valuation was a problem for LGF in February, it's bigger now. But Starz CEO Chris Albrecht describes the two companies as ""kissing cousins"" and a consolidating industry may force Malone's hand somewhat.

 At its upfront presentation for 2015, Hulu confirms it has acquired rights to the episode library of '90s hit Seinfeld, as well as signed an exclusive deal with AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) for The Walking Dead spinoff Fear the Walking Dead.
 
Seinfeld will premiere in June on Hulu after the service outpaced competing bidders including Amazon.com and Yahoo (YHOO), as well as Netflix, which bowed out early. That deal was widely watched as it's expected to cost as much as $180M -- Hulu's biggest ever. While Sony Pictures Television (NYSE:SNE) sold the distribution rights, much of that take will head to Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which owns the show's producer, Castle Rock Entertainment, and will continue to hold rerun rights on TBS. The AMC deal also means content from IFC, Sundance TV, BBC America and We TV -- meaning IFC films will also be on Hulu. Hulu -- co-owned by NBCUniversal, Disney and Fox (CMCSA, DIS, FOXA) -- says it's consolidated its two brands and so will be phasing out ""Hulu Plus.""

In new retail games, Battlefield: Hardline (NASDAQ:EA), a cops-and-robbers version of the war-game series, led sales charts followed by another new entry, action role-player Bloodborne (NYSE:SNE) which was strong despite being a PS4 exclusive. The top five was rounded out by Grand Theft Auto V (NASDAQ:TTWO), Mario Party 10 (OTCPK:NTDOY), and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (NASDAQ:ATVI). Physical software sales showed sharp declines for previous-generation consoles, which points to the health of the new generation (PS4, Xbox One, Wii U), whose software sales increased 58% Y/Y.

The lineup features content from three of the big four (CBS, Fox, NBC) as well as stations from Discovery, Scripps, Turner and Viacom. AMC content will join from April. Disney (NYSE:DIS) -- and its popular content from ABC, ESPN and Disney cable -- is still a glaring omission. Sony VP Eric Lempel says more content deals are in progress.

The gamble to replicate Marvel's success is a big one, but the rewards in media and merchandising are plentiful if the team can replicate the original success: The first film drew $242M domestically, while its sequel added $112M (and another $103M in foreign markets).

 Recent underperformance at the American box office is catching, as a lackluster weekend came with what some analysts are calling R-rated fatigue (too many films with the restricted rating that means lower box office overall). Sci-fi robot film Chappie (NYSE:SNE) led the take in the U.S. with $13.3M -- not strong, but enough for No. 1 in a week where ticket sales were down 35% Y/Y. Among other debuts, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (NASDAQ:FOXA) drew $8.5M, good enough for third behind the $10M of Will Smith feature Focus (NYSE:TWX). The other key opening was Unfinished Business (FOXA), a new bomb for Vince Vaughn at 10th place with $4.8M. Some of the veteran films still playing pushed their takes -- Kingsman: The Secret Service (FOXA) drew $8.3M to reach $98M; The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (VIA, VIAB) sold $6.7M to reach $148.7M; and Fifty Shades of Grey (NASDAQ:CMCSA) took in $5.5M to hit $156M domestically.

465,Where could HBO Now go? (And where does it leave HBO Go now?),"Mar. 6, 2015, 6:48 AM","
 While HBO (NYSE:TWX) is in high-profile talks with Apple to launch its streaming HBO Now service on Apple TV, other providers will be joining in at some point or even at launch day yet, including Google and TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) among others. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be first to agree to the launch, Bloomberg notes, because its negotiation is simpler than that with HBO's longtime pay TV partners. Cox Communications and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) are also linked to discussions, though traditional cable/satellite providers are a tougher sell, accustomed as they are to the traditional arrangement (and income stream). It's safe to assume all the partners marketing HBO's current HBO Go offering are likely to engage in some level of talks with TWX to offer HBO Now -- including Roku, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Cable repercussions? Several pay TV operators had started lowering their price for HBO via promotions, a possible move to brace for HBO Now's direct launch: Comcast lowered its monthly HBO rate from $18.95 to $15, or $10 if you order online. Verizon's offering HBO for $9.99/month for first 12; Time Warner Cable is offering $9.99/month for online orders; Cox is offering $10/month for the first six. As for HBO Go -- the current service that allows mobile viewing for authenticated existing HBO customers -- it appears it will continue to exist as is for now, despite the likelihood of product confusion. HBO's targeting 10M broadband subscribers who don't have cable or satellite -- at this $15 price point, it makes a huge competitive interface with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  "

The FBI has issued a flash alert which warns that other company might already have the malware in their systems.

""Third Point has met with management several times and is confident that Alibaba (BABA +3.8%) can generate long-term value in its core markets and compete in new ones, making it a compelling potential multi-year investment,"" writes Dan Loeb in his Q3 letter (.pdf).
Loeb likes how the ""substantial network effect"" that exists for Alibaba's marketplaces both creates a strong moat and allows the company to obtain ""an unrivaled amount of data on Chinese consumers.""
However, it's the ""under-appreciated"" value of Alibaba's other assets, such as its Alipay stake, the Aliyun cloud infrastructure platform, and the China Smart Logistics JV (48%-owned, handled 38% more packages than UPS in FY14) that intrigue him the most. At current levels, Loeb thinks he's effectively getting free call options on these businesses.
Following a near-20% gain on his Sony (SNE -0.5%) investment, Loeb decided to bail out. Though approving of Sony's restructuring efforts, he thinks ""more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes.""
Loeb has confirmed reports Third Point took a major position in eBay (EBAY +3.3%) in Q3, and says ""a meeting with CEO John Donahoe this summer left us impressed by his process-driven approach to optimizing the business.""
He argues the post-split eBay ""will offer two appealing growth, relative value, and capital return profiles for investors,"" sees Marketplaces delivering high-single digits growth, and downplays Apple Pay-related concerns for PayPal on the grounds that Pay is primarily an offline payments solution.
Like others, Loeb expects an independent PayPal to have more partnership options with tech/Internet giants. He thinks it's only being valued at 11.5x-14.5x 2015E EPS, a range deemed ""too cheap for a company growing sales 20% with significant strategic optionality and a strong chance to shape the future of payments.""

Electronic Arts (EA +4.5%) is rallying after Madden NFL 15, FIFA 15, NHL 15, and The Sims 4 respectively came in at #2, #3, #6, and #8 on NPD's top-10 list. Of the four games, only Madden was on the August list (#1 in its launch month). Battlefield 4 (#9 in August) fell out of the top-10.

Starting June 9, Microsoft (MSFT +0.8%) will sell the Xbox One at a $100 discount to customers willing to forgo a Kinect sensor.
Microsoft's move allows it to price the One on par with the PlayStation 4 (SNE +1.1%), which has easily outsold the One since both consoles launched last November. But consumers who opt for the cheaper bundle also have to do without an accessory that's tightly integrated with many of the One's games and services, as well as its core UI.

The Nikkei reports Sony (SNE +0.5%) is halting OLED TV development. Universal Display (OLED -5.2%) spiked sharply lower on the report, but has recovered some of its losses.
Sony, which showed off the world's first 4K OLED TV in January, has already called off an OLED TV JV with Panasonic. Today's report follows one from a week ago stating Samsung is scrapping plans for an OLED TV plant, as sky-high price tags relegate the technology to niche status for now in spite of its image quality and form factor strengths.
Universal is giving back a portion of the big gains it saw on Friday due to a Q1 beat and guidance hike that drew plenty of sell-side praise.

 DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ:DWA) CEO Jeffery Katzenberg fired out a warning to the movie industry during his talk at the Milliken Global Conference in Beverly Hills last week. “Movies are not a growth business,” exclaimed the exec who cut his teeth on the medium. Katzenberg sees a future where movies play for a short period of three weeks at theaters for $15.00 - followed by a run on TV at $4.99 and smartphones at $1.99. The forecast doesn't bode well for theater operators and associated businesses.
DreamWorks plans increasing its focus on shortform (digital and TV) in response.
Liberty Media (LMCA) CEO Greg Maffei also cautioned at the conference of a seismic change in the media industry as ""clutter"" from video games and social media crowds out traditional entertainment channels. Movie studio stocks: DIS, LGF, SNE, VIAB, TWX, FOXA, VIA, CMCSA

The rumors were true: Amazon's (AMZN +0.6%) new streaming set-top will support ""thousands"" of Android games by next month (live blog). To play them, Amazon is providing an optional $40 controller that comes bundled with 1,000 Amazon coins (normally retails for $9.50) to buy games with, and a tablet controller app. A small number of titles can be played with the Fire TV's bundled remote.
Electronic Arts (EA -0.9%), Take-Two's (TTWO +0.2%) 2K Games unit, Sega, Gameloft, and Disney are among the game developers on board. Amazon, as reported, will also be developing its own titles. The Verge: ""The graphics are pretty solid, they seem about on par with what you can get on top-end Android devices. It's not lagging at all.""
Should Sony (SNE -0.6%), Ninetendo (OTCPK:NTDOY), and Microsoft be worried? The Fire TV, and perhaps also gaming set-tops reportedly on the way from Apple and Google, are unlikely to compel hard-core gamers to ditch their PS4s and Xbox Ones. But much like mobile devices, they could gain a strong following among consumers wanting a cheap, simple, casual gaming experience.

Meanwhile, The Verge reports ""several big companies"" had made overtures to Oculus (no names are given), and that the startup's VC investors ""offered the company more money to go it alone.""
Over time, Oculus' Rift headset, which Facebook hopes will be used for many non-gaming applications, could compete against Google Glass. For now, they address different markets: Rift is much heavier/bulkier than Glass, but also provides an immersive VR/3D gaming experience.
During a CC, Mark Zuckerberg asserted the Rift is ""way ahead"" of rival products such as Sony's (SNE -0.4%) Morpheus (due in 2015), and that Oculus' talent is unmatched. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe argues Facebook's resources will help make the Rift cheaper (the dev. kit currently goes for $350).

Stacy Higginbotham remains an Oculus skeptic: While calling a demo she tried out ""immersive and neat,"" she adds it was ""nothing like real life."" Brad Stone thinks ""there's nothing social"" about headsets that ""[blot] out absolutely everything around you.""

Jim Edwards, defending the deal, calls the Rift the kind of product for which words can't describe ""how incredible the experience of wearing one is."" VC Chris Dixon, who backed Oculus, makes a similar case.
Some game developers are unhappy about the deal. As are some of the Kickstarter backers who poured $2.4M into Oculus, and only have t-shirts and dev. kits to show for it. Facebook has joined several other Internet momentum stocks in selling off in the wake of King's disappointing IPO.

 The recent warnings up and down the retail sector on slow store traffic trends haven't gone unnoticed by movie studios and theater operators as they look for ways to reach revenue targets this year and beyond. The toughest nut to crack for the movie industry might be ""Generation Z"" - a group that is more focused on devices and streaming options than traditional film distribution channels. Media analysts think the ""all-or-nothing"" nature of Gen Z increases risk for studios with their big budget films. Rentrak (NASDAQ:RENT) is one company that is on top of tracking Gen Z.

 Movie studios continue to double down on superhero franchise films in the hopes of hitting the paydirt despite the risk of oversaturation. The increasing pace of superhero releases could create a ""major blood bath"" next summer, warns Relativity Media CEO Ryan Kavanaugh. He sees a potential ripple of major losses ($400M-$500M) as studios reach too far with their superhero tentpoles. Though smaller studios bring in financiers to share the cost and the risk, the majors are more likely to go it alone.

Unofficially, the hardware hasn't been hard to find on the black market, with sellers typically hawking modified systems that support pirated games. However, the government's decision should open the door for console makers and game developers (EA, ATVI, TTWO) to formally market their wares, replete with Chinese-language translations.

It also lets users stream PS4 games, and (like many rival devices) provides access to a slew of streaming services.
The standalone Vita TV will go on sale in Japan for ~$100 on Nov. 14. A $150 version adds a controller and an 8GB memory card.
The console, meant to address casual gamers who might not care to spend $399 on a PS4 (or $50-$60 for its newest titles), is being launched shortly after the $99 Ouya Android console, and amid reports Google and Amazon are working on Android consoles of their own. Also, there's speculation the Apple TV set-top will soon add game controller support, given iOS 7 supports the feature.
Separately, Sony has unveiled the PS Vita 2000, an updated version of its handheld console that's 20% thinner and 15% lighter than its predecessor, and also adds 1GB of internal storage.

714,The Men Who Stare at Proxy Wars: Clooney rips Loeb's Sony efforts,"Aug. 2, 2013, 5:02 PM","

George Clooney doesn't pull any punches while attacking Dan Loeb's critical view of the performance of Sony's (SNE -1.5%) studio ops.
Playing the role of a populist, Clooney accuses Loeb of ""trying to  spread a climate of fear that pushes studios to want to make only tent poles,"" and of failing to note Sony's recent successful releases, including some unconventional winners.
On top of calling for the spinoff of Sony's entertainment ops, Loeb has been upset over the box office numbers delivered by big-budget Sony summer releases After Earth and White House Down. He also bemoans a lack of new hit Sony TV shows, and declares the company ""has missed the market for unscripted television.""
Loeb thinks an entertainment spinoff/IPO would yield accountability for the division's missteps. ""While CEO [Kazuo] Hirai focuses on Electronics, Entertainment is in desperate need of proper supervision.""
Sony's Pictures division saw a 16% Y/Y revenue drop (in dollars) to $1.61B in the June quarter. Operating income only amounted to $38M, and would've been -$68M if not for the $106M sale of the division's music publishing catalog.
