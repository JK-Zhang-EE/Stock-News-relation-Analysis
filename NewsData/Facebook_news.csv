Comps vs. last year's problem quarters should mean revenue beats, and the F8 developer conference April 30-May 1 should provide another catalyst, Sandler says.

 Facebook (FB -1%) and other Internet messaging services are making a monetization move through introducing new crytocurrencies for payments on their systems, The New York Times reports. In Facebook's case, it's working on a coin that users of WhatsApp could send instantly via the service to friends and family, according to the report. The company's already talked to crypto exchanges about selling the coin. But messaging rivals including Telegram and Signal also plan digital currencies, as do Korea's top messaging app (Kakao) and Japan's (Line). Those companies may have the scale to succeed where previous start-ups failed in getting currencies into broad application. And this round of coin designs reportedly do away with the energy-heavy mining process on which Bitcoin is dependent. But technical and regulatory challenges still remain in bringing cryptocurrencies to scale. Facebook is said to have more than 50 engineers working its project.  "

 Facebook (FB +1.3%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is asserting his control over three distinct messaging services in an ambitious move to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger at a technical level, The New York Times reports. The three services would continue operating as stand-alone apps but would see a unified messaging structure underneath that would allow (for example) a Facebook user to send an encrypted message to a WhatsApp user, which could lead users to stick with texting inside Facebook properties rather than turning to Apple (AAPL +1.5%) or Google (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +0.9%). It might also promise a better chance at making money from (relatively) low-revenue WhatsApp and Instagram, perhaps via new advertising or other fee-based services. The project's in early stages and wouldn't wrap until late this year or early 2020, according to the report. The move is causing some internal turmoil; it's a reversal of Zuckerberg's earlier stance that the acquired companies' products should remain heavily separate, and amid exits from WhatsApp's and Instagram's founders, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Zuckerberg over the new integration plan on internal message boards and at a December staff meeting, the NYT says.

Those changes prevented people from sharing friends' information with developers like Six4Three, which developed an app called Pikinis -- and some short-term extensions to that policy were granted, to keep some apps from breaking while they updated. ""Pikinis didn't receive an extension, and they went to court."" It notes that there's a difference between friends' data and friend lists, and ""In some situations, when necessary, we allowed developers to access a list of the users’ friends. This was not friends’ private information but a list of your friends (name and profile pic)."" As for charging developers (via ad purchases) for access to data: ""We explored multiple ways to build a sustainable business with developers who were building apps that were useful to people. But instead of requiring developers to buy advertising – the option discussed in these cherrypicked emails – we ultimately settled on a model where developers did not need to purchase advertising to access APIs and we continued to provide the developer platform for free."" As for targeting competitor apps, it says years ago it decided to restrict apps built on the platform that replicated core functionality. ""These kind of restrictions are common across the tech industry with different platforms having their own variant including YouTube, Twitter, Snap and Apple."" It says it's decided to ""remove this out-of-date policy so that our platform remains as open as possible."" Damian Collins -- the UK lawmaker that's head of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee -- said today that he believed there was ""considerable public interest"" in releasing the documents, which ""raise important questions about how Facebook treats users data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market.""

Their prevalence on Facebook remained steady at 3% to 4% of monthly active users, however, since the company is able to remove most of these accounts within minutes of registration.

 In a team-up with Facebook (FB -0.5%), Microsoft (MSFT +2.2%) is shifting course in its approach to artificial intelligence software, opting for the social network's particular flavor in recent weeks, CNBC says. TensorFlow from Google (GOOG +1.9%, GOOGL +1.5%) is the most popular open-source AI software, and Facebook came out with its answer (PyTorch) in late 2016, not too long after Microsoft put its Cognitive Toolkit on GitHub with a more permissive open-source license. While Microsoft still updates Cognitive Toolkit, it's clearly acknowledging the quick adoption of Facebook's PyTorch and is working to add its strengths to the system. ""The momentum of community, really, is around PyTorch and TensorFlow, and so that's where were throwing the bulk of our emphasis,"" says Microsoft's Eric Boyd.

 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts a lengthy response to yesterday’s NYT report detailing how CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg “stumbled” during the bumpy past year at the company. Facebook denies knowing about Russian activity in Spring 2016 but slowly launching an investigation and employing others to attack Apple on behalf of the company. Facebook says it’s committed to fighting fake news, didn’t remove President Trump’s comments on the Muslim ban for the same reason other newspapers covered the news, and that Sandberg only championed the sex trafficking legislation “because she believed it was the right thing to do.” Facebook shares are down 1.7% premarket.

 A deep dive by The New York Times into a year of discontent at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) paints a picture of the historically unique company's executive response to being beset by crisis after crisis: ""Delay, deny and deflect."" With Facebook becoming a powerful force in daily life around the globe, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg ""stumbled."" ""Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view,"" says the piece, in which more than 50 people were interviewed. ""At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives."" Facebook responds by acknowledging that it has been slow to address challenges, but has made progress; in the meantime, lawmakers and the Trump administration have been working up proposals for a national privacy law, which would set off a lengthy battle over the future of Facebook's central business model. Troubles in the executive ranks were apparent in late 2015 when then-candidate Donald Trump used the platform for a call to shut down Muslim immigration, and they accelerated with news in 2016 that Russian hackers seemed to be probing Facebook accounts to find people connected to the presidential campaigns. Along the way, Facebook's political backing began to fracture under pressure from angry lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties.

 Morale is getting a thumbs-down at Facebook (FB +1.3%), with internal measures showing a sharp turndown amid the past year's challenges, The Wall Street Journal reports. An internal ""pulse"" survey taken by nearly 29,000 employees shows just over half of them were optimistic about the company's future -- a drop of 32 percentage points from a year earlier, according to the report. And 53% said Facebook was making the world better, vs. 72% the prior year. While the workforce has been resilient in past challenges, this time may be different because declines in the stock price may be playing a bigger part in morale due to stock-option compensation. Many of the company's newest employees work in safety and security and have options worth less now than a year ago.

But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary."" ""I don't know if there's been much hostility; I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated,"" Delrahim says. ""Over the last 30-40 years we've had a pretty strong and bipartisan consensus ... on the right balance for antitrust enforcement ... Are there areas, do we wish it would go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets. We're not picking winners and losers, we are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure the markets are free, for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones."" And as for the president's tweets about antitrust matters, including weighing in on the ACA's pressure on Comcast (CMCSA -0.2%), Delrahim notes the consent decree tied to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal expired but it's his job to make sure markets work nonetheless -- and he reiterated his opposition to behavioral remedies to cure antitrust concerns. ""We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make profit, and then they evaporate after five years, 10 years, seven years,"" he says. ""And it makes no sense because seven years before, we're trying to guess where the market is."" ""I believe in structural solutions,"" he adds, saying that's why DOJ was opposed to parts of the AT&T/Time Warner merger ""and that was the solution we provided.""

 A U.S. court effort to force Facebook (FB -2.7%) to wiretap voice calls in its Messenger app recently failed, Reuters reports.

Telecom companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but that law exempts many apps relying solely on Internet infrastructure (as Facebook contends applies to Messenger).

 In its look at Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) visual-shopping partnership with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Los Angeles Times digs into the appeal of the deal and floats the prospect of a buyout down the line. The new feature allows Snapchat users to focus the app's camera on an object or a barcode and get a pop-up card with the item's information on Amazon, with a clickthrough to buy -- though Snapchat didn't get into details of the arrangement. But the Times notes Amazon currently pays out commissions of 1-10% to referrers depending on product category. And while the feature is nearly identical to that in Amazon's own app, Pew research shows 78% of Internet users 18-24 use Snapchat, and Snap says its users are 20% more likely to make mobile purchases and 60% more likely to make impulse buys. Meanwhile, NYU marketing prof Scott Galloway notes Amazon's record of putting partners out of business once it figures out their model but notes Snap hired Amazon vet Tim Stone as its CFO (with $20M in stock), which could point to a bigger relationship in time. Snap is ""probably going to be below $5 a share"" within six months, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) sucking out the room's oxygen -- and Snap's Evan Spiegel “can’t sell to Facebook, since that would be admitting defeat.

Both S&P and MSCI are overhauling their Global Industry Classification System (""GICS""), which is likely to have significant implications as ETFs, mutual funds, and various and sundry sector balancers rejigger their portfolios, Barron's says in this weekend's cover story. Shuffles include:The shuttering of Telecom and the creation of Communication, which will become host to Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and game stocks like [ATVI]. This will lop 23% off Tech's market cap, and leave it much more concentrated on chips, hardware and software.Consumer discretionary will become even more exposed to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with stocks like Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also moving to Communication.Further complicating matters, S&P will shuffle the deck post-market on Sept. 21; MSCI is aiming for early December.Many popular ETFs will be impacted, for example XLY and XLK.  No change to QQQ though, which tracks the largest 100 non-financial  stocks on the Nasdaq regardless of sector classification.A second article notes that:A Deutsche Bank study finds that stocks that get disproportionately sold when an index rebalances outperform those that get bought over the following 12 months.Tech stocks, already leading the bull market, should benefit the most from the changes; spreading them across three sectors instead of two will allow fund managers to buy more of them without running up against sector-weight limits or appearing over-exposed.

Speaking on CNBC, Mahaney said the market ""way overreacted"" to Facebook earnings. (Shares are still nearly 17% below the point they reached before earnings on July 25). The core ad business is fine and the company's readying monetization of messaging, and with ""robust"" valuation in big tech, it's one of the better investing opportunities in the area, he says. The company's outlook turned off some investors, but Mahaney suggests the guidance was conservative and messaging monetization offers ""huge profit pools"" waiting to be uncovered. He expects it will reclaim that $217/share mark it had reached before the earnings report.  "

 AT&T's (T +0.9%) WarnerMedia chief John Stankey had a lot to say in a discussion with Richard Plepler, chief of AT&T's new acquisition HBO -- but foretelling a ""tough year"" ahead doesn't necessarily mean the service as we know it will be steamrolled, Recode notes. While Stankey did highlight the need to get more eyeballs -- the better to monetize them and compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and particularly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which Stankey name-checked -- he also told Plepler that the company wanted HBO to have autonomy and resources to grow. ""You will have a lot of autonomy,"" he told HBO employees. ""You’ll be asked to do more of what you already do very well ... I don’t think it’s status quo. We need more. And in order for you to do more, you’re going to have to have the latitude, the freedom and the resources to be able to go about doing what you all do very well."" ""We need hours a day. It’s not hours a week, and it’s not hours a month. We need hours a day,"" Stankey said in one of many comments aimed at Facebook. ""You are competing with devices that sit in people’s hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes."" The one certainty is that it looks like HBO will get bigger, with the corresponding increase in content budget. Stankey says there will be a select number of platforms with direct consumer relationships, but he doesn't know how many. ""It’s not going to be 10, it probably won’t be two. Now, is it going to be eight, six or four? I don’t know, but if it’s four we need to be one of the four. If it’s six, we need to be one of the six.""  "

 Reuters publishes a reminder that the tech industry is heading for a shakeup (and volatility) this fall when the pending Global Industry Classification Standard goes into effect.               The GICS reorganization will shift stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet from information technology to a broadened telecom sector renamed communications services.                Others joining the newly defined sector include Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The changes aren’t yet finalized.                Funds tracking the telecom, tech, and consumer discretionary sectors will have to trade billions of dollars of stock to realign holdings by the September 28 effective date.                   Vanguard Group has already started adjusting its sector ETFs and State Street Global Advisors is launching a new fund.   "
422,WSJ: Instagram readying long-form user video posting,"Jun. 5, 2018, 10:30 PM","
 Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) is getting ready to allow user-posted videos of up to an hour long, much longer than currently permitted, the WSJ says. The photo- and video-sharing app currently limits users to one-minute videos, which was already a bump up from shorter videos previously. The new feature would focus on vertical video more like what users typically produce with phones rather than in movies/TV. But Instagram's talks with content creators and publishers about long-form video production center around offering it via the Instagram app, according to the report. And that length might have it encroach a bit more into YouTube's territory (GOOG, GOOGL). It would mark another step into what Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg calls the ""mega trend"" of digital video.  "

424,Messy Facebook/WhatsApp split shows revenue strategy clash,"Jun. 5, 2018, 12:07 PM","
 The ongoing messy split between the founders of WhatsApp and the app's high-profile parent, Facebook (FB -0.1%), points to an important internal debate over strategy, a new WSJ piece notes. WhatsApp creators Jan Koum and Brian Acton are leaving about $1.3B on the table in walking away from the social-networking giant, and that follows persistent disagreement over strategy and returns on Facebook's $22B purchase of the messaging service, by far its largest acquisition. Chiefly, that involves a dispute over data privacy and getting more revenues out of targeted ads long opposed by WhatsApp founders. Acton and Koum wanted to pursue some non-advertising methods of generating revenue, while Facebook execs pointed to Instagram as a more lucrative ad-based model. Acton and Koum left without loud disagreement, hoping to preserve their relationship with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but had concluded they were fighting a losing battle in a ""very passive-aggressive"" environment, the report says. Acton forfeited about $900M in stock when leaving last fall; if Koum departs mid-August as expected, he'll leave behind $400M in unvested shares. Each would have gotten all remaining shares if they had stayed until this November.  "

The joint panel with Commerce has 44 members in the room. 2:50 p.m.: Among a number of opening remarks, Sen. Bill Nelson offers to ""cut to the chase"": If Facebook and other social media companies don't ""get their act in order, none of us are gonna have any privacy anymore."" 2:57 p.m.: Zuckerberg's opening statement recaps much of his language over the past week: Facebook is an ""idealistic and optimistic company,"" he says. It's not enough to give people tools to connect, he says; the company needs to make sure those connections are a net positive and that the tools are used for good. Shares are now up 3.4%; Nasdaq is up 2% as a whole. 3:07 p.m.: Sen. Nelson takes Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's hint that the company could charge users who don't want to see targeted ads, and presents it to Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg says people can turn off third-party information today. ""I think what Sheryl was saying was, in order to not run ads at all, we'd need some kind of business model."" Does that mean the user information is Facebook's property? ""No, Senator. The first line of our terms of service"" says the user owns the information. 3:12 p.m.: Cambridge Analytica has begun what could be a lengthy tweetstorm as the hearing progresses. 3:23 p.m.: ""There will always be a version of Facebook that is free,"" Zuckerberg tells Sen. Orrin Hatch. Then how do you sustain the business model? ""We run ads."" 3:27 p.m.: Zuckerberg's answers get clipped as Sen. Maria Cantwell asks whether Silicon Valley firm Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica how to use the data for political campaigns, and gets specific about the Trump campaign. ""Senator, I'm not aware of that."" 3:39 p.m.: Sen. Pat Leahy steers it to Special Counsel Robert Mueller and whether that probe has hit Facebook. ""I'm not aware of a subpoena,"" Zuckerberg says after cautioning about revealing confidential info. ""There may be, but I know we're working with them."" He's not been interviewed himself, he says. Shares are now up 4.2%. 3:46 p.m.: Pressed repeatedly by Sen. Lindsey Graham on who the company's biggest competitor is, an evasive Zuckerberg tries to qualify that there's not just one. Is Twitter (TWTR +6%) the same?  ""It overlaps."" Do you think you have a monopoly? ""It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,"" Zuckerberg replies pointedly. 3:58 p.m: Sen. Roy Blunt touches a hot topic: Does Facebook do cross-device tracking and track offline data? ""I want to be sure we get this right,"" Zuckerberg says, saying he wants his team to follow up afterward. Pressed again (""It seems pretty simple""), he says ""I'm not sure of the answer to that question."" ... ""In general, Facebook is not collecting data from the other apps that you use."" 4:21 p.m.: Sen. Ted Cruz is aggressive in asking whether Facebook considers itself a neutral public forum, pointing to page takedowns he suggests are politically motivated or censorship. ""Our goal is not to engage in political speech,"" Zuckerberg says.The hearing takes a break: Fifteen senators down, 29 more to go. With the stock closed and light aftermarket action, we'll wrap here and alert if more news breaks.  "

 European privacy watchdogs are turning up heat on WhatsApp, saying the service hasn't acted to resolve concerns from last year over sharing user data with parent Facebook (FB -1%). The Article 29 Working Party -- a collection of EU data protection authorities -- notes in a letter published today that a year ago it raised concerns about the data sharing, but the company still hasn't resolved issues about getting user consent. WhatsApp had set a policy to share users' phone numbers and other information with Facebook, but suspended the policy for EU users after the objections. Ireland's data protection authority (with jurisdiction over Facebook's European headquarters) said in April it hoped to reach a deal on the issue with WhatsApp in coming months. Meanwhile, next May will bring a much toothier data protection law that gives EU regulators the power to fine companies up to 4% of global turnover.  "

 ESPN (NYSE:DIS) is going to be all right, Holman Jenkins Jr. says, and never mind its recent Jemele Hill controversy or politics -- subscriber losses are bound to slow and it still has its valuable ace in the hole, live sports. With scores available on every smartphone, SportsCenter may not be as vital as it once was (and that may explain the network's current talent roster, he says), but live sports are a last bastion of ad viewing in a Netflix world. And while tech giants including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) begin throwing billions of dollars at content to build out their video, they may have a rude awakening translating their streaming-program experience into the technical challenge of serving up a live football game to 13M eager viewers, while the traditional broadcast model is optimized for it.

 Updating today's fast-moving Facebook (FB -0.3%) stories: Following initial reports that the company had settled a class-action lawsuit over share reclassification, Facebook disclosed it was dropping its plans for the restructuring altogether. Facebook had said that the plan it revealed last year -- to issue reclassified Series C shares that were publicly traded but had no voting rights -- was set to allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife to more easily route money to philanthropic causes. But suing shareholders feared dilution and argued that the plan would let Zuckerberg maintain voting control even if his equity control were as low as 2%. The suit is mooted with the plan dropped. Meanwhile, in an SEC filing laying out the abandonment of that plan, Facebook also said that Zuckerberg ""anticipates selling 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook stock over approximately 18 months"" to fund philanthropic initiatives. The high end of that range, 75M shares, would sell for about $12.8B today, while Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan have a fortune valued at $72.4B.

 Mobile apps are still leading the way among consumers' digital consumption, but they're tending to stick with ones they know and already have, according to a new comScore report. Some 57% of consumers' digital media time is taking place in mobile apps, according to comScore's 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps report, but a majority of consumers download zero apps per month. That 57% activity in mobile apps breaks down as 50% in smartphone apps and 7% in tablet apps. Meanwhile, desktop accounts for 34% of time and mobile Web 9%. Meanwhile, not only are younger users skewing the curve on mobile-apps time spent (those 18-24 are spending 3 hours a day in apps, vs. 2.6 hours for 25-34, and 2.3 hours for 35-44), they're the ones who are downloading new apps. Of those 18-34, 70% say they're always looking for new apps and they're willing to pay for them. Just over 50% of all users don't download new apps, and 66% of users buy zero paid apps per month.

 Facebook (FB -1.5%) is working up a feature that news publishers have long pushed for: the ability to subscribe to publishers directly from its app, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company will launch the feature by the end of the year, the report says, and it's leaning toward a meter model with a few free pieces before users are urged to pay. One model also calls for publishers to take 100% of the revenue but Facebook to get the payment info. It could mollify big publishers (including NYT and NWS) who have seen their own stories get subsumed by Facebook's ""Instant Articles"" product, where they publish stories natively to the Facebook platform.

854,Facebook conference day 2: Still all about the camera,"Apr. 19, 2017, 1:23 PM","
 The day two keynote at Facebook's F8 conference (NASDAQ:FB) kicks off with Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer re-echoing the themes the company raised with developers yesterday: artificial intelligence, augmented reality and the camera, virtual reality -- and where those all come together. F8 developer attendees are all getting a free Giroptic iO 360 connected camera, Schroepfer said, positing 360-degree imaging (and then virtual-reality 360-degree video) as the next step beyond mere 4K video. Shares are up 1.1% today; M Science says it's staying above consensus for Facebook's Q1 results in North America, and that Europe results are tracking in line with expectations. Afternoon sessions yesterday revealed several interlocking initiatives at the social-media giant, but most immediately front and center (to judge from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's keynote) may be augmented reality. Layering digital effects onto the real world as seen through the camera is an audacious technical challenge (and dependent on the company's work on deep neural nets) but one that offers promise of pinning digital objects into the real world (such as leaving a note on a refrigerator or table that's only seen digitally). 1:51 p.m.: Augmented reality is cool, says Facebook's chief scientist for Oculus Michael Abrash, but AR glasses is where it comes together, and they'll eventually be a vital part of life. It's another glancing blow at Snapchat (SNAP +0.8%) and its Spectacles as Facebook bulls forward through all of Snap's differentiators.  "

FB stock floated around the flat line for most of the talks and is now just a few pennies below yesterday's close of $141.42. 2:22 p.m.: Still a work in progress, Messenger is more integrated with the company's ""M"" virtual assistant, jumping into conversations to provide help with basic tasks that often come up in chat such as arranging tickets or meals. The tool is more integrated with gaming as well, Marcus tells developers. 2:11 p.m.: Messenger bots were a key part of last year's F8, and they're still a key focus of development at Facebook today, even as the company works to address issues with Messenger's launch, David Marcus says. The tool is a big draw for users in chatting with companies, which are finding new ways to use it. 1:45 p.m.: Social VR chief Rachel Franklin comes on to unveil the beta release of Facebook Spaces, the company's first social VR tool. It will create a modifiable avatar based on photos of you, and integrate with Messenger video calling. 1:30 p.m.: Zuckerberg handed off to Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, but not before setting some tones for the conference: augmented reality, the camera, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The company will launch its first VR social tool, and make the camera the ""first augmented reality platform."" 1:15 p.m.: ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr., and we'll do all we can to prevent tragedies,"" Zuckerberg says briefly of the Cleveland victim whose killing was broadcast on Facebook, before he moves on to augmented reality talk. 12:59 p.m.: Zuck's about to go live. 12:30 p.m.: Another thing to watch for is news about the company's VR efforts after the departure last month of Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, and any details about the company's 360-degree camera. A number of sessions today cover WebVR, React VR and scripting/producing VR experiences. 11:55 a.m.: The suspect sought in a Cleveland killing that was broadcast on Facebook video has been found dead, apparently having shot himself to death after a police chase, Pennsylvania State Police say. The top news story is likely to draw some kind of response from Facebook chief Zuckerberg today. Facebook's (FB -0.2%) F8 developer conference is set to begin with registration/breakfast in about 5 minutes in San Jose, with expectations set for what may be interesting hardware unveilings as well as some detail on what the social-media giant may be planning to deal with recent controversy over violent/objectionable content on the platform.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg will deliver a keynote tomorrow which might supply details on new hardware. The conference continues through Wednesday. The augmented reality work could attempt to build where Google Glass disappointed, and may open a wider competitive interface with social-media rival (and ""camera company"") Snap (SNAP -1.2%). With augmented reality the next frontier of technology, Facebook needs to make a statement, says former Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. “They realize to be part of this next wave, they’ve got to get real and hurry,” he says.

 Snap Inc.

That would still mean more than $20B from a company that paid nearly $22B for WhatsApp. ""One of the key points that the bears on Snap may be missing is that we believe that Facebook would love to acquire the company, and could be willing to pay $20B+ ($14/share) for the asset,"" writes Shebly Seyrafi. That means SNAP investors essentially have a put at that price. The firm launched Snap at Hold with a $23 price target. The company has a big presence in the youth demographic, and it's got momentum with advertisers (often at the expense of Twitter (TWTR -0.1%)), but user growth has been slowing, Seyrafi notes, and a lack of voting rights with shares could limit index inclusion, holding down upside. For Facebook, meanwhile, taking out Snap would get rid of one of its few real long-term threats, even if the price is steeper than its last attempt (a $3B offer for the company a few years ago).

The fix to this issue, however, will result in an approximate 35% count increase.For Instant Articles, average time spent per article was over-inflated by 7%-8% on average since August 2015.

 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) now will be showing ads to non-users -- on third-party apps and websites, to anyone who has ever visited Facebook. The company is expanding its ""Audience Network"" to let its advertisers reach people who don't use the social-media site. It had shown ads elsewhere before, but only to its users. The ads may not be as relevant as ones shown to its users. But the key may be whether they are more relevant than third-party competition that the ads might run in place of, and help Facebook fight for ad dominance with Google. Like other companies, Facebook will rely on cookies to collect browsing data and serve ads. More than 80% of Q1 ad revenue came from mobile ads.  "

As it is, FBX has only functioned on Facebook's PC site - mobile accounted for 82% of Q1 ad revenue - and didn't support video ads. Other PC ad options, such as news feed ads recommending a user like/follow a page or shop at the advertiser's site (they can be purchased directly from Facebook), remain in place.
Facebook has been pruning its ad offerings in order to focus on high-quality formats that deliver a strong ROI. In March, the company ended a test for an automated ad-buying platform after seeing ""many bad ads and fraud."" More recently, it laid off ~40 workers within its LiveRail video ad unit (serves third-party publishers), and stopped doing business with LiveRail publishers that didn't meet Facebook's quality standards.

Gaming site Kotaku reports Microsoft (MSFT +1.5%) plans to launch ""a cheaper, smaller, Xbox One"" this year, and will launch a more powerful model in 2017. The cheaper/smaller Xbox is expected to be shown off at the industry's E3 conference (runs from June 14-16).
The 2017 console, codenamed Scorpio, will have a more powerful GPU, and be capable of handling 4K gaming and directly supporting Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift VR headset. Microsoft already has a partnership with Oculus through which streamed Xbox One games can be played on Rift headsets connected to Windows 10 PCs.
Also reported: 1) Microsoft wants to further its efforts to converge Xbox and Windows, with future hit games released on both platforms. 2) Microsoft is moving towards an ""incremental"" upgrade model for consoles (much as it's doing for Windows), with frequent hardware upgrades replacing massive upgrades that arrive every several years.
Sony has been widely reported to be prepping a revamped PlayStation 4 that supports 4K gaming and ""enhanced"" support for the company's PlayStation VR headset. Both the new console and the PlayStation VR are expected later this year.
AMD (AMD +0.2%) supplies an APU (integrated CPU/GPU) for both the PS4 and Xbox One, and will presumably get an ASP boost from the sale of more powerful APUs for 4K-capable consoles.

Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) fell another 3.6% today, as the brutal selloff seen in response to the company's weak Q2 guidance (issued with Q1 results on Thursday morning) refused to end. Possibly contributing: Morgan Stanley joined the ranks of firms downgrading the Chinese mobile app developer. Credit Suisse and Macquarie downgraded on Friday.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) algorithm changes contributed to Cheetah's outlook. The company derives a large portion of its ad revenue (Credit Suisse estimates 25%-30%) from Facebook - it runs ads delivered by Facebook's mobile app ad network (the Audience Network), and also sells ads for clients on Facebook. Last fall, Facebook adjusted its algorithms to help advertisers know how ads are performing on 3rd-party apps, and it turned out ads on Cheetah's apps didn't perform well. The company has also implemented ad policy changes affecting Cheetah's ability to sell ads on Facebook.
After the bell, Cheetah announced a study done with Google's AdMob mobile ad unit (competes with Facebook's Audience Network) found the deployment of AdMob native ads provided a 400% revenue boost for Cheetah's Battery Doctor app during a test. In addition to AdMob, Cheetah is also counting on an ad partnership with Tencent to lower its Facebook dependence.

Oculus, less than two months removed from beginning shipments of its first commercial Rift headset - it costs $599, and needs to be paired with a PC sporting a powerful graphics card - is often seen as having an early hardware and software technology lead. But there's plenty of competition: HTC recently began shipping its Vive VR headset, and Sony's PlayStation VR headset (works with the PS4) will ship later this year. And last week, Google unveiled its Daydream VR platform, which will work with compatible Android phones and compete with Samsung/Oculus' $99 Gear VR headset (less powerful than the Rift).

1133,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"Apr. 15, 2016, 12:47 AM","


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

As expected, Facebook (FB +1.7%) has used its F8 conference to launch a developer platform for creating automated Messenger chatbots that (with the help of A.I. and natural-language processing) can conduct transactions and provide information.
Mark Zuckerberg argues the platform eliminates the need to download apps for many activities, as well as call businesses to place orders. ""I’ve never met anyone who likes calling a business,"" he quips. Two examples given: Buying flowers from 1-800 Flowers and having stories delivered by a CNN bot.
Facebook has already partnered with Uber and Lyft to enable ride requests via Messenger. Competition for Facebook's bot platform is provided by Microsoft (via its Bot Framework) and Amazon (via its Alexa voice assistant platform, which has been opened up to developers).
Zuck also announced Facebook is creating an API for its Live streaming platform (received a big revamp last week) that will allow any connected device to record and transmit Live streams. A DJI (DJI) drone streaming live video flew over the stage as Zuck talked.
Also disclosed: Facebook, which just launched the first commercial Oculus Rift VR headset, wants to provide an integrated VR and augmented reality (AR) headset in 10 years that doesn't look much different from a standard pair of glasses. Zuck: ""Augmented reality gives you the ability to see the world, but also deliver overlays on top of the real world."" Echoes of Google Glass.

A graphic showing Facebook's 10-year roadmap highlighted three priorities: Global web connectivity, A.I., and VR/AR.

A month ago, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) confirmed its interest in live-streaming the National Football League next season. Now it has withdrawn from the bidding, sources say.
The key sticking point: Facebook wants its live videos to be commercial-free, and balked at the NFL’s traditional advertising model.
The NFL commands a high price for live streaming: in the most recent deal, CBS and NBC each paid about $45M/game for five Thursday night games during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly obsessed with making Facebook's live-video service a success.
The NFL continues to shop digital rights to its Thursday night games. Contenders include: Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Yahoo (YHOO) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

1144,Report: Yahoo is thinking of letting Facebook sell ads within Tumblr's app,"Mar. 18, 2016, 3:17 PM","

Citing sources at both companies, The Information reports Yahoo (YHOO +2%) is thinking of letting Facebook (FB +0.4%) sell ads within Tumblr's popular mobile app, with the companies splitting the revenue that's produced.
Though Tumblr reported having 550M monthly visitors as of last year (only some of them have set up Tumblr accounts, the rest are just browsing its content), the blogging platform failed to hit Yahoo's $100M 2015 revenue target, leading Yahoo to take a $230M write-down on its $1.1B 2013 purchase of Tumblr. The Information reports only 10%-15% of Tumblr's ad inventory is being sold.
A Tumblr deal would involve Facebook's Audience Network, one of the top players in the mobile ad network space (others include Google's AdMob and Apple's iAd). Facebook previously disclosed the Audience Network was on a $1B/year revenue run rate (includes publisher payments) as of Q4. Yahoo has its own mobile ad network thanks to the Flurry acquisition, but Facebook's is reportedly ~3x larger, with Facebook getting a $200M cut on 2015 ad spend of $675M. Facebook argues its superior user data acts as a differentiator.
In other news, Facebook reportedly plans to unveil a Bot Store for Messenger at its April F8 developer's conference. The store would let users access various automated services  (for example, weather reports, food orders, or flight check-ins) by sending a message to an automated service.

1146,Baird: Facebook partner data points to accelerating Q1 sales growth,"Mar. 14, 2016, 3:15 PM","

Through February, clients of Facebook (FB +0.5%) ad partner Kenshoo had increased their social media ad spend by 87% Y/Y, up from Q4's 50%, reports Baird's Colin Sebastian (Outperform rating, $120 target). Sebastian adds strong demand for Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads - they allow multiple products from an advertiser's catalog to be promoted - is contributing to the growth,, as is growing Instagram monetization.

Kenshoo estimates Dynamic Product Ads now make up 8%-9% of total social media ad clicks. Video ad clicks account for an estimated ~20% of Facebook's total (the same as Q4), and app install ads - a market for which Google (GOOG, GOOGL) just unveiled new offerings tied to mobile search - 10% of Facebook ad spend. Both search and social ad spend are deemed healthy as online ads continue taking share from offline channels, with search still accounting for ~3x as much spending as social.
Not surprisingly, Sebastian believes Facebook (has a long history of posting sales/earnings beats) can top Q1 estimates. Kenshoo also provided strong numbers in January ahead of Facebook's Q4 report - the company wound up trouncing estimates on the back of 57% Y/Y ad sales growth, up from Q3's 45% and Q2's 43%.

""When asked to rank order all the major Online Advertising platforms based on ROI, marketers placed platforms in three clear groups: Google (GOOG +1.1%, GOOGL +1.3%), Facebook (FB +1.1%) & YouTube (“YT”) again lead, Twitter and LinkedIn are in the middle, and Yahoo and AOL are last,"" reports RBC's Mark Mahaney following a survey of nearly 2,000 ad pros. ""We note that Twitter (TWTR -3.5%) was the only platform to see a clear falloff in its relative ROI vs. our prior survey, while AOL showed a modest improvement.""
Mahaney adds 62% of Facebook, 54% of Google, 48% of YouTube (Google-owned), and 32% of Twitter advertisers plan to up their ad spend on the platforms over the next year. Only 9%, 10%, and 8% of Facebook, Google, and YouTube advertisers plan to cut their ad spend; for Twitter, the number is 23%.
31% of Google advertisers and 28% of Facebook advertisers spend over 30% of their online budgets on the platforms. 59% of Facebook, 42% of Google, and 39% of YouTube advertisers think their ROIs have improved over the last 6 months. Notably, 69% of advertisers had positive attitudes towards Facebook's autoplay video ads, and 76% have a YouTube budget allocation.
Mahaney states Twitter, which provided soft Q1 guidance last month, ""generally had the weakest results with respect to advertiser budget allocation, expected future spend, and general satisfaction."" Meanwhile, a record 45% of survey respondents showed an interest in advertising on Snpachat (CHAT), which is reportedly aiming for 2016 revenue of $300M-$350M.
The survey data comes after both Google and Facebook reported strong Q4 ad figures. Google's revenue from its own sites rose 20% Y/Y in Q4 to $14.9B, as 40% paid click growth (fueled by YouTube and mobile search) more than offset a 16% drop in ad prices. Facebook's ad revenue (boosted by Instagram's ad growth) rose 57% Y/Y in Q4 to $5.6B, an improvement from Q3's 45% growth.

Snapchat stepped up its monetization efforts in 2015.

Last spring, CEO Evan Spiegel stated Snapchat has close to 100M daily active users in developed countries.
The WSJ reported last week Snapchat has raised $175M from Fidelity at the same $16B valuation it obtained last year.

1149,"Facebook pulls plug on ad-buying service test, cites ""bad ads and fraud""","Mar. 7, 2016, 1:10 PM","

Following a test with advertisers, Facebook (FB -1.9%) has pulled the plug on a demand-side ad-buying platform (i.e. a DSP) for its Atlas ad-server/measurement solution.
Ad tech chief David Jakubowski states low ad quality drove Facebook's decision. ""[W]e plugged into a number of the usual exchanges and bought across several formats ... We were able to deliver ads to real people with unprecedented accuracy, but came up against many bad ads and fraud (like bots). While we were fortunately able to root out the bad actors and only buy quality ads, we were amazed by the volume of valueless inventory.""
Notably, he adds the only ad formats that ""delivered significant value"" during the test were native ads (Facebook and Instagram feed ads are native ad types) and video ads (another area Facebook is well-exposed to). Not surprisingly, mobile ads in general delivered much of the ""true business value"" found in the test. Facebook VP Brian Boland claims native/video ads delivered ""7x better results than banner ads.""
As part of its efforts to double down on ad types it considers effective, Facebook is rolling out new tools for Atlas: A tool for measuring the impact of online ads on offline sales, a service that gives advertisers insights on how users see ads across devices before making a purchase, and a video-ad-serving/measurement service. Jakubowski: ""[M]any marketers still choose to deliver and measure their ad campaigns using desktop-first tools that are not built for a cross-device world — and they’ve got the wasted spend to show for it.""
Facebook has tried to differentiate Atlas in part by using anonymous Facebook profile data (rather than cookies) to measure ad performance across devices. Atlas competes against Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) DoubleClick unit, which (among other things) is a major player in the DSP space through its Bid Manager platform. Independent DSP providers Rocket Fuel (FUEL +5.1%) and Sizmek (SZMK +3.9%) are higher today.

Facebook's advertiser count dwarfs the 130K reported by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in its Q4 report, and highlights the company's strong small-business inroads. Last week, Facebook announced Instagram, which began to be aggressively monetized last year, has topped 200K advertisers.
Facebook's efforts to get businesses to buy ads have included giving advertisers a standalone app, allowing businesses to sell products on their Facebook Pages (with the help of Buy buttons), and letting users contact businesses via Messenger. Efforts to provide advanced targeting and measurement tools for businesses have been ongoing for years.

""It took 10 years to go from building the initial smartphone to reaching the mass market ... So I can’t imagine it would be much faster for VR,"" says Mark Zuckerberg (NASDAQ:FB) in a wide-ranging interview with Germany's Die Welt am Sonntag. ""I do think a new computing platform always emerges every 10 or 15 years. VR is currently the most promising candidate.""
Zuck adds Facebook is ""mostly interested in the software"" when it comes to VR - Oculus is seen as having an early edge here - but adds it's necessary for the same company to do both hardware and software in the early stages of a new platform's development. ""Only later does specialization become valuable.""
When asked why anyone should buy the Oculus Rift ($599 + the cost of a PC featuring a high-end GPU) over Samsung's $100 Gear VR headset, Zuck declared the former delivers a far superior experience. ""VR is a very intense visual experience and having the most powerful PC is the only way to deliver certain experiences ... You are playing Ping Pong or interacting with someone and the technology needs to be fast enough so that when you do something, it triggers and sends that action all the way across the Internet to someone else.""
Regarding artificial intelligence, Zuck predicted the technology will usher in an era of unsupervised learning. ""You have this model of how the world works in your head and you’re refining it to predict what you think is going to happen in the future ... A.I. will help us with this."" He also dismisses Elon Musk's concerns about A.I. potentially being a threat to humanity.

Facebook insists the change was carefully planned. ""For more than a year we have been conducting global research including focus groups and surveys to determine what types of reactions people would want to use most. We also looked at how people are already commenting on posts and the top stickers and emoticons as signals for the types of reactions people are already using to determine which reactions to offer ... We will continue learning and listening to feedback to make sure we have a set of reactions that will be useful for everyone.""
Advertisers and brands have previously suggested Reactions will give them a better understanding of how users are responding to a post or ad, and thus help them deliver better ads and improve targeting.

1164,Facebook launches sports platform; ad partner reports strong Q4 data,"Jan. 21, 2016, 1:20 PM","

Looking to make a dent in the online sports media world and better compete against Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as a venue for following/discussing live sports, Facebook (FB +1.4%) has launched Sports Stadium, a platform declared to be ""a dedicated place to experience sports in real-time with your friends and the world.""
Like ESPN.com, Yahoo Sports, and other sports sites, Sports Stadium provides live scores, stats, and game info. It also delivers posts and commentary from the Facebook pages of sports teams, leagues, and writers, and sports-related posts and comments from a user's friends. The platform is accessible by searching for a game (additional means of access will arrive later), and initially limited to American football games and U.S. iPhone users. Other sports, countries, and platforms will be added in time.

Re/code observes Sports Stadium could help Facebook advertisers run campaigns that leverage info about sports event conversations, and could also lead more sports media personalities to engage on Facebook. Both Facebook and Twitter have partnered with Nielsen to measure conversation activity related to TV shows.
Separately, ahead of Facebook's Jan. 27 Q4 report, ad partner Kenshoo has reported social media ad spend by its clients rose 50% Y/Y in seasonally strong Q4, fueled by Instagram's ad ramp and Facebook's introduction of Dynamic Product Ads. Ad impressions fell 21% Y/Y, but clicks still rose 30% thanks to a 64% increase in click-through rate (better ad quality/targeting). Cost per click (ad prices) rose 10%.

Tech large-caps aren't being spared as the Nasdaq drops 2.6%, and the S&P 2.7%, in the market's latest plunge. A slew of companies with $10B+ market caps are seeing declines that on many recent days were largely reserved for smaller ex-momentum plays.
The casualty list includes Alibaba (BABA -5.3%), and that of course means Yahoo (YHOO -6%) is along for the ride. Top Alibaba rival JD.com (JD -6.2%) is also down strongly; Chinese macro fears continue to run high.
Facebook (FB -4.9%), which (unlike most peers) remains well above where it traded 12 months ago, has fallen towards $90. Q4 results arrive on Jan. 27.
Cisco (CSCO -5.2%) has fallen below $23. Possibly weighing: Piper's Troy Jensen has reported weak Q4 networking reseller survey results, and predicts Cisco will issue light FQ3 (April quarter) guidance next month with its FQ2 report. His FQ3 sales estimate has been cut by $400M to $11.9B (below a $12.07B consensus).
DRAM/NAND flash maker Micron (MU -10.3%) is among the biggest decliners, with shares falling into the single digits. Micron now trades for 6.6x an FY17 (ends Aug. '17) EPS consensus of $1.48. Online payments leader PayPal (PYPL -4.4%) is having a rough day as well.
IBM (IBM -4.7%), meanwhile, has made new multi-year lows after providing soft 2016 EPS guidance to go with a slight Q4 beat. Netflix (NFLX -6%) has sold off in spite of reporting strong Q4 subscriber adds.

""Many WhatsApp users don't have a debit or credit card number and they worried they'd lose access to their friends and family after their first year,"" the company wrote in a blog post.
The app had previously charged an annual renewal fee of $0.99 for all users after their first year.

1167,Report: Google creating virtual reality unit to battle Facebook/Oculus,"Jan. 12, 2016, 5:08 PM","


Re/code reports Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is ""forming its own dedicated division for virtual reality computing.""
Clay Bavor, previously in charge of both Google Apps (Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.) and the Cardboard VR platform, is now solely running the VR unit. Diane Greene, the Google board member whose startup (Bebop Technologies) was recently acquired by the company for $380M, will now be in charge of apps.
Google already has a healthy VR presence - Cardboard (relies on Android phones to work, supports cheap hardware) has received a measure of developer support, and YouTube has become a popular source for VR-friendly 360-degree videos. However, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus unit is widely seen as having a hardware technology lead in the nascent market, and has won the support of numerous developers. Oculus announced last week the first consumer Rift VR headset (requires a PC with a powerful GPU) will sell for $599 and begin shipping in late March.
Separately, Google has announced its annual I/O developer's conference (typically features a slew of product announcements) will be held this year from May 18-20 in Mountain View, CA.

1168,Facebook Messenger tops 800M active users; 2016 agenda discussed,"Jan. 7, 2016, 10:24 AM","

Seven months after surpassing 700M monthly active users, Facebook Messenger (FB -2.3%) has topped 800M. WhatsApp topped 900M in September, and Instagram 400M. Overall, Facebook had 1.55B MAUs at the end of Q3.
Messenger chief CEO David Marcus uses the announcement to discuss several core ""themes"" that will drive Messenger's development in 2016. Among them: The belief that SMS and phone numbers are increasingly becoming irrelevant as mobile messaging continues evolving. ""You can make video and voice calls while at the same time not needing to know someone’s phone number. You don’t need to have a Facebook account to use Messenger anymore, and it’s also a cross platform experience...""
Shortly after news emerged that Facebook is providing developers with an SDK that lets them create Messenger bots that can deliver information and handle transactions, Marcus asserts ""[message] threads are the new apps,"" and that Facebook is ""thinking about how we can help you interact with businesses or services to buy items, order rides, purchase airline tickets, and talk to customer service in truly frictionless and delightful ways.""
Marcus also suggests Facebook is working on new tools for helping users personalize individual an group conversations, and that Messenger's M assistant will see broader availability in time.
Facebook is selling off on a morning the Nasdaq is down 1.8%.

1169,"Facebook prices Oculus Rift at $599, launches SDK for Messenger bots","Jan. 6, 2016, 12:08 PM","

The first consumer Oculus Rift (FB +0.3%) model will cost $250 more than the PlayStation 4 and $200 more than the Xbox One. Pre-orders have begun for 20 countries. The VR headset comes with a remote, an Xbox One controller, and a couple of games; it ships on March 28.
Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe previously suggested the Rift's all-in cost will be around $1500, after factoring the cost of a PC powerful enough to run the headset (a high-end GPU is recommended). GPU leader Nvidia recently launched VR Ready, a program meant to guarantee a given PC or graphics card will deliver a quality VR experience.
Last June, Oculus announced a partnership with Microsoft to allow Xbox One games streamed to Windows 10 PCs to be played on the Rift. The company has also partnered with Samsung to launched the less powerful Gear VR,  a $99 headset that relies on a Samsung phone's display and processor. The Oculus Touch handheld motion controllers ship in 2H16.
Separately, Facebook has quietly given some developers access to an SDK that lets them create bots that automatically return information/photos, process transactions, and provide other services in response to user interactions. The feature, which brings to mind a similar offering from Tencent's WeChat (dominant in China), supports Buy buttons and can use Messenger's payment-processing system.
Messenger has 700M+ active users globally. The SDK launch follows a deal with Uber allowing Messenger users to make Uber ride requests, and the launch (in test mode) of a part-human, part-A.I., Messenger assistant service called M.

In a blog post on Monday, Oculus revealed very little except that pre-orders will open from 8 a.m. Pacific time and that each headset will come with two free games - Lucky's Tale and CCP's EVE: Valkyrie.
Last year, Oculus execs hinted that the Rift headset and a computer needed to run it would cost no more than $1,500 together.

The ruling means retail and institutional investors who assert they lost money by purchasing shares at inflated prices may pursue their claims as groups.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is testing the use of multiple, topic-based, news feeds in its core mobile app. The traditional news feed still exists within the test, but it's complemented by secondary feeds with titles such as Style, Travel, and Headlines.
The secondary feeds make it easier for users whose standard feeds are swamped with content from hundreds of ""friends"" and Pages to follow specific types of material. A Facebook spokesperson: ""People have told us they'd like new options to see and have conversations about more stories on Facebook around specific topics they're interested in. So we are testing feeds for people to view different stories from people and Pages based on topic areas.""
Separately, Facebook is testing a more ambitious deployment of its shopping marketplace, which provides a personalized list of products being sold on Facebook pages (possibly with the help of Buy buttons), along with a search option. Though in testing since October, the feature was until recently buried within Facebook's app. Now, users seeing the test have a Marketplace icon placed on the bottom menu bar, to go with News Feed, Requests, and Notifications icons.
The topic-based news feeds could lend themselves well to ads fitting with specific content types (e.g. travel ads within the Travel feed). Meanwhile, e-commerce ads are a natural fit for the marketplace.

Not surprisingly, a Nielsen study on the most popular 2015 U.S. smartphone apps found the core Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) app to be #1, with an estimated 126.7M average monthly unique users (+8% Y/Y). Facebook Messenger was #3 (96.4M users, +31%), and Instagram #8 (55.4M, +23%).
YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), was #2 with 97.6M users (+5%). Google Search was #4 (95.4M, +3%), Google Play #5 (89.7M, +7%), Google Maps #6 (87.8M, +8%), and Gmail #7 (75.1M, +4%).
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had the last two spots in the top-10, via its Music app (54.6M users, +26%) and Apple Maps (46.4M, +16%).
Nielsen estimates 52.6% of U.S. smartphone users are on Android, and 42.7% using an iPhone. Smartphone penetration (as a % of mobile subscribers) is pegged at 80% as of September, up just slightly from 78% at the end of 2014.
Though now claiming less than 1/6 of the world's ~1.8B smartphone users, the U.S. remains disproportionately important from a digital advertising standpoint. Facebook received 50% of its Q3 revenue from North America; Google/Alphabet received 47% of its Q3 revenue from the U.S..

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has updated Messenger to allow users to hail UBER rides without leaving the app. The service is initially launching in the U.S, and will later arrive elsewhere. Uber will pay for a user's first Messenger-enabled ride, up to $20.
More ride-hailing services (LYFT?) will be added in the coming months. Messenger claims 700M+ monthly active users, and has been rapidly expanding its reach. 3rd-party app support and a P2P money transfer service were launched in March, and a part-human, part-A.I. assistant service called M (built into Messenger) has been in testing since this summer.
Rival messaging platforms such as WeChat, Line, and Kik are already aggressively monetized via value-added services. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested he's uninterested in monetizing Messenger until it hits 1B users. WhatsApp, meanwhile, has topped 900M MAUs while maintaining a no-frills philosophy.

Under the URL facebook.com/services, Facebook (FB +0.9%) has created a searchable directory (still in test mode) of local service providers such as electricians, auto repair shops, veterinarians, and spas. Browsing through category listings provides phone numbers, addresses, links to service provider Facebook pages, and average Facebook review ratings.
In addition to standard local service providers, searches on the site turn up listings for local businesses such as restaurants, bars, and hotels. TechCrunch observes the site's search rankings suggest Facebook could be leveraging user data (e.g. which business pages a user has previously visited or reviewed) to optimize results.
As is the norm for new product launches, Facebook isn't monetizing the service for now. Local business search and directory ads would be a natural fit. Facebook recently said it has 50M+ active business pages that collectively receive 2.5B monthly comments. Earlier this year, the company took steps to turn Messenger into a business-to-consumer communication tool.
Local business reviews leader Yelp (YELP -4.1%) has sold off in response to Facebook's move - this isn't the first time Yelp (still dominant in its core market) has reacted this way to a Facebook product launch. Paid local services marketplace/reviews site Angie's List (ANGI +1.3%) remains up moderately on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.4%.

""[W]e find TWTR continuing to cede ground to faster growing competitors, such as Instagram and Snapchat, despite Twitter’s multiple product improvements made this year,"" writes Evercore's Ken Sena (Hold rating) after taking in both November comScore data and Evercore survey results. His target has been cut by $3 to $22, matching the Street low.
Sena: ""Total minutes on the platform through November continue to fall in the mid-single digits domestically, while other social platforms demonstrate double-digit growth off of larger bases, with Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (CHAT) now 150% and 50% larger, respectively. This is in spite of multiple major product launches, including Moments as well as the partnership with Google. Although we do not have December data yet, the data through November suggests to us that the Street’s 325mm MAU estimate (or 5mm net adds, reflecting an acceleration from 4mm in 3Q) may be too optimistic, and we maintain our 323mm estimate.""
He adds the preference among advertisers for networks with more scale - Twitter appears to be attempting to address this by trying to monetize logged-out users - along with higher Twitter minimum ad spend requirements, are ""driving a sharp deceleration in revenue growth."" Moreover, Sena doesn't think 2016 Street EBITDA estimates reflect the traffic acquisition costs tied to off-network ad sales growth.
The note comes five days after CLSA launched coverage with an Underperform rating and $26 target. SunTrust simultaneously issued a bullish note praising Twitter's Promoted Tweets test with logged-out users.

Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently-launched Tesla M40 GPUs have been designed into Big Sur, a computing platform created by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) specifically for A.I./machine learning tasks, and which has been open-source for use/improvement by third parties.
Big Sur contains eight GPU boards, but consumes just ~300W of power. Nvidia says it worked with Facebook to optimize Big Sur for delivering ""maximum performance for machine learning workloads, including the training of large neural networks across multiple Tesla GPUs."" Wired observes Facebook and others have found neural networks, which are modeled after the behavior of human neurons and improve their decision-making by taking in more data, are much more efficient when relying heavily on GPUs.
Facebook, like Google, has been investing heavily in machine learning for some time. Use cases include translating content, detecting faces within Facebook photos/videos, and improving the company's news feed algorithm by analyzing text. Machine learning is also being used by Facebook's M assistant (still in test mode).
The Facebook news comes a month after Nvidia unveiled the Jetson TX1, a module for drones/autonomous cars that runs on a Tegra processor and is declared to be ""the first embedded computer designed to process deep neural networks.""

A Facebook spokeswoman confirms to CNET the apps have been pulled, while adding they hadn't been updated in a while. ""Since their launches, we've incorporated elements of Slingshot, Riff and Rooms into the Facebook for iOS and Android apps.""
Like Google, Facebook has shown a willingness to frequently experiment with new non-core products, and to pull the plug if they don't catch on.

The Nasdaq is up 1.9%, but someone forgot to tell Pandora (P -4.5%), which is now down 15% since the company announced a $300M convertible debt offering on Wednesday afternoon.
Today's drop comes after Pandora priced the offering to feature a 1.75% interest rate and a $16.42/share conversion price (36% above current levels). The offering has fueled speculation Pandora will invest heavily in a subscription streaming service, following a recent $75M deal to buy key assets and hire employees from bankrupt streaming service Rdio.
Meanwhile, Rdio says it's laying off 123 employees. Sources talking with VentureBeat estimates Rdio has 140-180 employees.
Pandora, for its part, says it has given job offers to ~100 Rdio employees. CEO Brian McAndrews previously declared Rdio's IP and talent would underpin a major expansion of Pandora's subscription music offerings, as the company's listener growth continues to be pressured by the likes of Spotify and Apple Music.
Separately, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has begun allowing artists and venue owners to directly sell tickets from Facebook's site and apps, via ""Buy Tickets"" buttons and related payment-processing services. The service, for now only available in the Bay Area, acts as competition for Ticketfly, which Pandora recently bought for $450M.
As with its standard Buy buttons, Facebook isn't taking a cut on enabled ticket sales. However, the company could benefit if the feature boosts conversion rates for ads containing the buttons, and thus lifts ad prices.

1191,Facebook makes its 2 trillion+ posts available for search,"Oct. 24, 2015, 3:16 PM","

""With over 1.5 billion searches per day and over 2 trillion posts in our index, search is an important, long-term effort at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),"" the social networking giant states while unveiling a major overhaul of its search engine. All Facebook posts can now be accessed via keyword-based searches, provided a post is accessible to a user based on its privacy settings. Personalized search suggestions are also provided.
In addition to allowing users to more quickly find older posts, photos, and videos from themselves and friends, Facebook's revamped search engine gives it the potential to act as an alternative to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for real-time news search. A search for ""World Series"" turns up related trending topics, relevant posts from friends, and posts from Sports Illustrated, the NYT, NBC News, and other media sources. The overhaul comes amid reports Facebook is prepping Notify, an app that manages and sends out push notifications from news sources and other publishers.
The update also raises the possibility of public Facebook posts being indexed by and integrated with Google, Bing, and other search engines. Twitter already has integration deals with Google and Bing.
For now, Facebook reiterates it's not focused on monetizing search for the time being; keyword-based search ads are a natural fit for the new search engine. A Bing integration deal was ended last year.
Facebook's Q3 report arrives on the afternoon of Nov. 4.

1192,"Facebook higher after Argus upgrades, sets $115 target","Oct. 15, 2015, 9:54 AM","

Argus Research's Joseph Bonner has upgraded Facebook (FB +1.7%) to Buy, and set a $115 target.
Echoing arguments familiar to many sell-side firms, Bonner cites Facebook's high mobile adoption rates, mobile ad monetization, and the potential of Messenger and Oculus. He also argues Facebook's Shopping page (currently being tested) will be well-received by advertisers and provide the company with more data about its users' shopping habits.
Shares are back above $95, and go for 35x a 2016 EPS consensus of $2.75. Q3 results arrive on Nov. 4.
Separately, in a recent Wired interview, Messenger chief David Marcus talks up Facebook's efforts to turn Messenger into an alternative to e-mail for interactions between businesses and customers (with the help of the M personal assistant), as well as to provide ""a frictionless payment experience"" and monetize e-commerce via ads.
Marcus: ""eBay takes a cut of every transaction and listing; Alibaba does all that for free, and makes money from advertising. Alibaba is bigger than eBay and Amazon combined, and is growing much faster. We take the same approach ... Businesses will want to pay to be featured or promoted - which is a bigger opportunity for us.""

1194,Shopify down sharply as Facebook tests Shopping feed,"Oct. 12, 2015, 11:46 AM","

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is testing (with select users) a feed within its mobile app that shows a list (personalized based on connections, likes, and interests) of products highlighted by businesses on their Facebook pages.
For now, Facebook isn't going out of its way to highlight the feed: To access it, users first need to click on Facebook's navigation menu tab, and then select Shopping from the Favorites category.  The move follows the launch of Buy buttons that allow users to make purchases without leaving Facebook, and the creation of mobile storefronts (via Shop and Services sections) for Pages that let users browse a business' products/services.
E-commerce software/services provider Shopify (SHOP -8.7%) has tumbled following Facebook's announcement. The selloff comes in spite of the fact Shopify has partnered with Facebook to help clients adopt Facebook's Buy button and mobile storefronts.
Facebook has been uninterested in taking a cut on transactions enabled by its various e-commerce tools. Rather, the company aims to give retailers more incentive to buy Facebook ads, and to drive higher ad prices by boosting conversion rates.

1195,Twitter launches YouTube-like video ad service; shares up 16% on the week (updated),"Oct. 9, 2015, 9:59 AM","

Twitter (TWTR +1%) has updated to Twitter's Amplify video ad platform to let advertisers buy pre-roll ads for various content categories, rather than having to set up a deal with a particular content publisher. The solution also lets advertisers target specific audience groups watching a type of content.
Publishers currently supporting the service include Sports Illustrated, The Weather Channel, Fox, and AOL. They receive a cut of ad revenue via automated payments.
The solution has much in common with how YouTube (still by far the biggest player in online video ads) monetizes its content. One notable difference: Twitter is taking a 30% cut on ad sales, less than YouTube's (GOOG, GOOGL) 45%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has also been gradually rolling out new video ad buying options and formats. However, the company has said it's uninterested in pre-roll ads.
Shares have rallied strongly during a week that has seen Jack Dorsey named permanent CEO, and the Moments (Project Lightning) curated event stream service roll out.

1196,"Facebook tests Reactions emojis instead of ""dislike"" button; advertisers approve","Oct. 8, 2015, 2:54 PM","

Reactions complement Facebook's (FB - unchanged) standard Like button by providing six emojis - they're labeled Love, Haha, Yay, Wow, Sad, and Angry - that can be used to provide reactions to news feed posts. The feature is being tested in Spain and Ireland.
Mark Zuckerberg recently confirmed Facebook is working on a mechanism that would let users express empathy over a sad event, while adding the feature wouldn't let users register a negative opinion towards a post. Facebook director of product Adam Mosseri notes many users are already relying on Stickers to provide a wordless response to a post. ""Typing on mobile is difficult, and and this is way easier than finding a sticker or emoji to respond to in the feed.""
Advertisers and brands like the potential of Reactions to provide a better understanding of how viewers are responding to a post than the Like button allows by itself. ""The data will help marketers break down the posts more specifically,"" says the chief creative officer of architecture firm Mithun. An exec at ad firm Fluent: ""I wouldn't be surprised if advertisers gain access to this data over time and start targeting campaigns based on the emotional state of various consumer segments.""

1198,"Facebook goes after TV ad dollars with new buying options, Nielsen deal","Sep. 28, 2015, 2:26 PM","

Looking to make a splash at the Advertising Week conference (runs from Monday-Friday in NYC), Facebook (FB -4.5%) has announced a partnership with TV measurement leader Nielsen (NLSN -2.8%) to let advertisers run joint Facebook/TV ad campaigns using Nielsen's traditional target rating point (TRP) buying system.

The solution is initially launching for news feed video ads, and will arrive on Instagram in Q1 2016. It lets brands and agencies buy ads aiming to reach a certain % of a demographic group (a TRP) on TV and Facebook, with the option to buy a portion directly with Facebook. Nielsen's services verify ad delivery and compare performance with standard TV campaigns. Facebook claims 42 joint TV/ad campaigns yielded a 19% total increase in targeted reach relative to TV-only campaigns, and were twice as likely to hit their target audience.
Facebook exec Carolyn Everson: ""It's very much in many ways how TV [ads are] bought today where the advertiser or the agency can submit their budget and their reach goals and how many [gross rating points] they're looking to achieve.""
Along with the TRP-based solution, Facebook is launching ""brand awareness optimization"" tools meant to help advertisers target viewers likely to recall their ads, support for mobile advertiser polls, and support for videos within its carousel ad format. eMarketer estimates U.S. digital video ad spend will rise 33.8% this year to $7.8B, and 23.4% next year to $9.6B. YouTube remains the market's biggest player.
Also: Facebook says it now has 2.5M advertisers on its platform, up from 2M in February. Shares are off sharply on a day the Nasdaq is down 3.2%.

1202,Facebook to start using Like and Share buttons for ad targeting,"Sep. 18, 2015, 1:01 PM","

Starting in October, Facebook's (FB +0.1%) Like and Share buttons, nearly ubiquitous on the Web, will be used to send browsing data to Facebook that can be used to deliver targeted ads via its core service, Instagram, and mobile app ad network (i.e. the Facebook Audience Network).
Notably, a user doesn't have to click on a like or share button for data to be sent; simply visiting a page containing them is enough. Facebook is looking to address privacy concerns by letting users opt out of seeing ads based on non-Facebook activity.
Facebook already has plenty of experience with cross-site and cross-app ad targeting. E-commerce ads based on browsing activity are a staple on Facebook's news feed and (website) right-hand column, and the Audience Netowrk leverages Facebook activity data to send targeted ads to 3rd-party apps. Meanwhile, the company's Atlas ad-measurement/serving platform uses Facebook profiles (instead of cookies, which don't work as well on mobile) to anonymously track the performance of ads on and off Facebook, and across multiple devices.

Nine months after stating he's open to adding a ""dislike"" button meant to express empathy for a sad event (but not the disliking of an opinion or content), Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed during an online Q&A session Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is working on one. ""It’s surprisingly complicated to make an interaction that will be simple,"" he adds.
Zuck also reiterates his optimism about A.I./machine-learning - he suggests A.I., already used on Facebook to automatically tag users to photos, could be used to automatically filter graphic content.
He predicts a ""golden age of video"" will arrive over the next 5 years. Beyond that, he sees virtual reality going mainstream and (looking 25-35 years down the road) envisions a future where people can directly communicate thoughts from their minds.
Facebook, of course, has seen huge viewing growth for its autoplay videos, and is now trying to ramp its video ad sales. The WSJ recently reported Facebook is working on iOS/Android apps meant specifically for viewing spherical/360º videos - the kind that VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift are a natural fit for.

Instagram, whose photo/video streams lend themselves well to brand advertising, now also supports landscape photo and video ads (only portrait ads were previously supported), and has doubled its max video ad length to 30 seconds. Meanwhile, a new premium ad format called Marquee lets advertisers quickly reach large numbers of users in a short amount of time - Instagram calls it ""perfect for events like movie premieres and new product launches.""
In June, Instagram unveiled ""call-to-action"" ads that let users place e-commerce orders and install apps (among other things) after clicking on a button, as well as better targeting tools and an API for running ad campaigns via 3rd-party software. Axiom Capital recently reported seeing a ""meaningful increase"" in Instagram ad load.

WhatsApp remains very cautious about monetizing its platform, which has become a full-blown SMS replacement for many of its users. A $1/year subscription fee is charged in some markets, but WhatsApp remains free of the ads, games, and payment/e-commerce services provided by various mobile messaging peers. VoIP support was added earlier this year.
Separately, Axiom's Victor Anthony reports Instagram (over 300M MAUs) has seen a ""meaningful increase"" in ad load in recent weeks, with large brands such as Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Whole Foods, and Capital One among the advertisers. He thinks Instagram's ad sales will grow to nearly $4B by 2020 from just $102M in 2015. In early June, Instagram rolled out several new tools and ad formats for marketers.
Also: The WSJ notes Facebook is making it easier for its 850M+ Groups users to buy and sell goods with each other, thereby furthering its e-commerce ambitions and encroaching on eBay and Craigslist's turf. For now, Facebook isn't charging any listing or transaction fees.

M, launched today in test mode with a few hundred Bay Area users, operates within Facebook Messenger (FB +3.5%). Messenger chief David Marcus states M doesn't merely pull up information, but also completes tasks such as purchasing items, booking restaurants, and creating appointments.
Facebook is also looking to differentiate M from the likes of Siri, Google Now, and Cortana by relying on both A.I./machine learning and supervision from a group of Facebook employees called M trainers. A user sends a note to M by tapping a button within the Messenger app, and then receives follow-up questions and status updates on where a task stands.
Marcus, who once ran PayPal: ""We start capturing all of your intent for the things you want to do. Intent often leads to buying something, or to a transaction, and that’s an opportunity for us to [make money] over time ... An engineer went to Paris for a couple days, and his friend asked M to redecorate his desk in a French style. Twenty-four hours later, the desk was decorated with a proper napkin, baguette bread, and a beret."" Handling tedious customer service calls are another use case.
One lingering question, of course, is how well human supervision will scale if M is used by millions of Messenger users rather than just a few hundred, and if Facebook (via collected data and machine learning) can automate many of the tasks currently handled by people. Regardless, Marcus states Facebook plans to eventually employ thousands of M trainers.
Messenger was opened up to 3rd-party developers in March, and topped 700M monthly active users in June. Facebook is up strongly on a day the Nasdaq is up 2.7%.

Also arriving are the company's Dynamic Product Ads, which display images of products users have previously seen, and Carousel ads, which let users swipe through up to 5 images of advertised items.
Two video ad formats are supported: Native autoplay ads similar to the ones that appear in Facebook's news feed, and click-to-play ads that pop up on a screen. Facebook notes 80% of its Audience Network ad impressions now consist of native formats such as sponsored news feed posts.
RBC predicted in June video ads - they carry much higher ad prices than standard news feed ads - will account for over half of Facebook's ad sales over the long run. The company recently began allowing marketers to only pay for video ads that are viewed for at least 10 seconds.
Separately, Business Insider reports Facebook is working on an app that will push breaking news alerts from partner publications, with users selecting which publications they follow. The alerts would feature up to 100 characters, and a link to the related article on the publisher's site.

Facebook's (FB +0.2%) Oculus VR unit has acquired Pebbles Interfaces, an Israeli developer of ""technology that uses custom optics, sensor systems and algorithms to detect and track hand movement."" The WSJ reports the purchase price is around $60M.
Pebbles, which has 50 employees, will join Oculus' hardware engineering and computer vision teams to ""help advance virtual reality, tracking, and human-computer interactions."" Oculus is a month removed from unveiling (along with the first consumer Rift model) its Oculus Touch handheld motion controllers. The controllers work with Rift apps/games, and support 360-degree movement and haptic feedback.
Oculus hasn't been shy about using acquisitions to help maintain its VR tech lead. Last December, it bought hand-tracking tech developer Nimble VR, and 3D model-creation startup 13th Lab.
Separately, Facebook has begun testing the creation of full-blown e-commerce shops within business pages. The solution, which could help improve conversion rates (and thus ad prices) for Facebook ads, follows the recent launch of a Buy button.

Ahead of Facebook's (FB +0.7%) July 29 Q2 report, ad partner Nanigans has reported its clients saw a 13% Q/Q and 16% Y/Y drop in the average price of ads sold on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis to $0.54. E-commerce CPCs fell 35% Y/Y, while gaming CPCs rose 26%.
The average price for ads sold on a cost-per-impression (CPM) basis fell 6% Q/Q to $4.01 per 1K impressions, but was still up 142% Y/Y. E-commerce CPMs rose 91% Y/Y, and gaming CPMs 39%.
Click-through rates (CTRs), boosted by Facebook's ongoing efforts to improve targeting, rose 8% Q/Q and 187% Y/Y to an average of 0.88%. Video accounted for 16% of Facebook ad spend (21% on mobile), up from 13% in Q1.
Nanigans' report comes a week after Facebook announced it would no longer charge CPC advertisers for likes, comments, and shares related to their ads - a move that stands to both lower recorded ad clicks, and increase prices.
Separately, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak has hiked his Facebook target by $16 to $110.

Going forward, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will no longer charge News Feed advertisers paying on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis when a user likes, shares, or comments on an ad. They'll only be charged when a user clicks to visit another site, install an app, or use a Facebook-hosted app. Policies for CPM ads, which advertisers pay based on views rather than clicks, are unchanged.
Facebook declares the CPC overhaul, which could have a near-term effect on ad sales, is ""designed to provide [ad] measurement that’s more closely aligned with how advertisers are bidding so they can better optimize their campaigns against their stated goals."" The company predicts ""advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend, since they’ll be paying for only the most valuable outcome.""
As TechCrunch notes, the change could boost Facebook's ad prices, which have already grown rapidly over the last two years. ""Facebook is built to be a mousetrap for your time. Now it’s set up to be able to charge advertisers more to let you escape."" Last week, the company began allowing video advertisers to only pay for ads that are watched for at least 10 seconds.

In addition, starting in the fall, Facebook plans to give content providers such as the NBA and Fox Sports a 55% revenue cut (on par with YouTube's) for ads run against Suggested Videos. The news comes a day after Facebook began giving advertisers the option to only pay for video ads that have been watched for at least 10 seconds, and less than two months after the launch of Instant Articles, for which Facebook is allowing publishers to keep all of the ad revenue produced by their content.
With over 4B daily views for its autoplay videos and plenty of high-profile publishers sharing videos with followers, Facebook has already become a major indirect threat to YouTube, even if its video library and discovery features aren't yet comparable. In recent months, the company has begun letting users embed hosted videos on other sites, and has also added a Videos tab for Facebook Pages.
Last month, RBC predicted video ads (carry much higher per-view prices than display ads) would account for a majority of Facebook's ad revenue over the long run. Video ad tech platform LiveRail was acquired last summer.  "

The gains come as Instagram rolls out a revamped search engine and Explore page meant, in the words of co-founder/CEO Kevin Systrom, to provide ""a real-time visual pulse for what is happening in the world.""
The Explore page now shows photos related to trending locations and hashtags, as well as curated collections of photos from interesting accounts and places. The search engine now supports location-specific queries. Surfacing trending topics/hashtags has long been a Twitter staple, and is something Facebook proper embraced last year.
The updates come 3 weeks after Instagram unveiled a slew of ad formats and targeting tools meant to help it better monetize its 300M+ MAUs. Facebook exec Carolyn Everson recently said the company plans to ""open up the entire suite of Facebook [ad] targeting on Instagram over the next few months.""

RBC's Mark Mahaney (Outperform, $105 target) notes 2015 Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) revenue base is similar to 2007 Google's ... and that leads him to think Street estimates are too conservative.

""With varying levels of conviction, we have estimated the potential 2016 P&L impact from Autoplay Video Ads and Instagram to be $3.4B+ in incremental revenue and $0.40+ in incremental EPS. And we estimate the potential 2017 P&L impact from FB Messenger & WhatsApp to be $2.2B+ in incremental rev and $0.25+ in incremental EPS. Oculus Rift could have the potential to add a further $500MM+ to the topline in ‘17."" He adds survey work and channel checks indicate 54% of marketers are ""somewhat"" or ""very"" likely to buy Facebook video ads over the next 6 months, and that 72% are interested in spending on Instagram, which just significantly expanded its ad offerings. 
On CNBC, Mahaney added he thinks Facebook's autoplay video ad opportunity will be as big as its (non-video) mobile ad opportunity once was. ""[O]nly about 10 percent of the 500 advertisers that we surveyed are currently on there with video ads, but an additional 50 percent want to be on there ...

Facebook Messenger (NASDAQ:FB) has become the seventh app to top 1B Android downloads. The others: Facebook, WhatsApp, Gmail, YouTube, Google Search, and Google Maps.
Downloads, of course, aren't the same as active users: Messenger had 600M+ MAUs (on Android or otherwise) as of March, following a 2014 surge in response to Facebook's decision to remove messaging from its core app. The latest milestone comes as Facebook works to build an app ecosystem around Messenger.
Speaking of which, the first Messenger game has arrived: It's called Doodle Draw Game, bears a strong resemblance to Zynga's Draw Something, and relies on Messenger for social sharing/gameplay. The Information reported in May Facebook, which has seen its PC gaming revenue pressured by a shift to mobile casual gaming, is talking with developers about supporting Messenger games.
Instagram, which has historically emphasized its apps far more than its sites, is giving its PC and mobile sites a big facelift. In a nutshell, photos are larger and the design is more streamlined. Initial reactions are positive.
11 months after it began testing a Buy button that lets users make purchases without leaving its site/apps, Facebook has made the feature available to merchants using e-commerce software/service provider Shopify's (SHOP - just did an IPO) platform. As previously disclosed, Facebook isn't charging for the feature, but hoping it boosts ad conversions (and with them, ad prices).

It wants the app to work on any Android phone, and to load content quickly even when relying on 2G networks. Helping preserve bandwidth: Full-res photos aren't loaded unless a user taps on a photo thumbnail.
Much like its Internet.org initiative (provides free access to basic mobile Web services, recently turned into an open platform), Lite aims to grow Facebook's reach in underpenetrated regions. Of the 48M MAUs added by the company in Q1, only 8M came from North America and Europe.

As part of a broader rollout of direct response ads (i.e. ads meant to drive a purchase, sign-up, or other user activity) on the mobile photo-sharing platform, Instagram (FB +0.4%) is launching app install ads, long a cash cow for Facebook's core apps.
Instagram also plans to offer a ""Shop Now"" action that directs users to merchant sites to place orders. Facebook began testing a Buy button on its core service last summer with the goal of improving e-commerce ad conversions (and with them, ad prices). Google and Twitter are also embracing the concept.
Along with new ad formats, Instagram plans to give advertisers better targeting tools (an area that Facebook has plenty of expertise in). ""Working with Facebook, we will enable advertisers to reach people on Instagram based on demographics and interests, as well as information businesses have about their own customers. We will also improve the feedback mechanisms within Instagram to give people greater control and improve the relevance of the ads they see.""
Last but not least, an ad API will be released to help marketers run Instagram campaigns via 3rd-party software, and Facebook's ad-buying interfaces will be updated to support Instagram buys.
Collectively, the moves indicate Facebook is getting much more aggressive in its efforts to monetize Instagram, which has 300M+ MAUs and high engagement, and whose photo streams lend themselves well to brand photo and video ads. Though Instagram has inked deals with major ad agencies, Facebook has been cautious about monetizing the platform thus far.

The talks are said to come amid muted early adoption for 3rd-party Messenger apps, with developers complaining app discovery is difficult.
Facebook's options for monetizing Messenger games could be limited on iOS, where Apple acts as a gatekeeper for all app installs and gets a 30% cut on related in-app purchases; one possibility is for Facebook to get a referral fee for installs, much as it does for its app install ads.

Not surprisingly, LinkedIn (LNKD -20.5%) has received plenty of target cuts in response to the soft guidance (blamed on a variety of factors) provided with its slight Q1 beat. But no downgrades have arrived, and many on the sell-side are defending the professional social networking leader.
Canaccord's Michael Graham: ""Most factors impacting revenue appear temporary (FX, marketing solutions product transition, Talent Solutions sales force shuffle, lynda.com), while a display [ad] revenue headwind seems more secular ... We are encouraged by rapid growth in Sales Solutions, and believe any material weakness in the stock will likely provide a good long-term entry point.""

Key metrics such as number of members, mobile visitors, and corporate talent solution customers were all in line with expectations...""
Morgan Stanley estimates only 25% of LinkedIn's 2015 EBITDA guidance cut is due to fundamentals. Goldman thinks management is once more being conservative with guidance.
Brean's Sarah Hindlian, whose decision to launch coverage at Sell in March is looking smart right now: ""Premium Subscriptions/Sales Navigator missed by 3% [in Q1] while management talked down Sales Navigator ramp on the call and was mum on new customer signings ... we think the company is scrambling to buy growth and the [salesforce] re-org is due to product fatigue.""

They're still willing to spend money elsewhere, but they won't pay up for it. If there are cheaper options available to them when they use programmatic, there's no reason for them not to use them."" LinkedIn's unmatched professional data and favorable demographics could give it some room to differentiate in this landscape.

1241,EU to widen probe against U.S. tech companies,"May 1, 2015, 5:02 AM","

Just two weeks after launching its landmark competition case against Google,  the European Commission is poised to widen its front against U.S. tech companies by initiating a separate investigation into a broader range of online platforms.
The latest draft of the plan, seen by the FT, will encompass everything from online shopping to telecoms regulation and is set be approved by the commission next week.
The ""digital single market"" probe could also bring in stricter rules to video services companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and messaging apps like WhatsApp (NASDAQ:FB) and Skype (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have become big rivals to traditional European media and telecoms companies.

1242,Twitter strikes Google ad deal after weak Q1,"Apr. 28, 2015, 10:29 PM","

On a day that it posted a Q1 sales miss (a little ahead of schedule) and cut its full-year guidance, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announces it's partnering with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DoubleClick unit (a giant in the display ad space) to allow Twitter advertisers using DoubleClick to ""measure when conversions result from views and other actions on Twitter.""
Notably, Twitter/DoubleClick plan to give advertisers ""a new attribution model in DoubleClick to get a fuller understanding of how Twitter Ads served on mobile or desktop drive conversions for them across the web."" That could point to the (anonymous) use of Twitter profiles to track ad conversions. Also: The companies plan to make Twitter ad inventory available through DoubleClick Bid Manager, a widely-used ad-buying platform supporting many online ad exchanges.
The addition of Twitter as a partner is a notable win for DoubleClick as it tries to fend off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which last fall launched a new version of its Atlas ad server/measurement platform that tracks the performance of ads seen by Facebook users both on its site/apps and others. Facebook is counting on its anonymous linking of user profiles with ad measurement to give it an edge against DoubleClick and other rivals relying on cookies.
Meanwhile, Twitter's Q1 CC (live blog) failed to cheer up investors. The company mentioned Q2 user growth is off to a ""slow start,"" and that ad click rates (CTRs) declined Q/Q in Q1 due to a mix shift towards formats with lower CTRs. Ad load was flat, and app install ads (a format Facebook has seen huge success with) underperformed.
On the bright side, CEO Dick Costolo noted more than 1M people signed up for Twitter's Periscope live-streaming app in its first 10 days, that the company has seen ""orders of magnitude"" more native video on its site following the launch of a 30-second video platform in January, and that it's working with Apple on a Spotlight search integration deal. CFO Anthony Noto stated Twitter will begin counting users of its SMS follow service (there are currently ~6M) as MAUs.
Twitter fell 1.6% in AH trading after dropping 18.2% in regular trading on account of its results. Shares are now at $41.58.

1243,Facebook adds video call support to Messenger apps,"Apr. 27, 2015, 2:37 PM","
A month after launching a platform for integrating 3rd-party apps with Messenger, Facebook (FB +0.8%) is updating its iOS/Android Messenger apps to support video calling over mobile and Wi-Fi connections. The U.S. and 17 other markets are initially covered; more will be added later.Facebook's PC Messenger client (built into Facebook's site) has supported video calls since 2011, following a deal with Skype; Facebook later built its own video call infrastructure. Today's update makes the feature available to the 600M+ monthly active users of Messenger's mobile apps.One current shortcoming: Messenger app users can't place video calls to PC Facebook users. An exec says Facebook will soon fix the issue, and also plans to add group chat and video stabilization support. The long list of mobile apps/platforms currently supporting video calls includes Skype, Apple's FaceTime, Google's Hangouts, Tango, imo, WeChat, Line, and Viber.Both voice and video serve as natural extensions of Messenger's core chat features. Mark Zuckerberg stated in March Messenger now accounts for 10% of global VoIP phone calls. WhatsApp, which recently added VoIP call support to its mobile apps, doesn't yet support video calls. "
1244,Facebook bulls talk up video growth; spending guidance slightly cut,"Apr. 23, 2015, 1:56 PM","

Facebook (FB -0.8%) hasn't received any downgrades after posting its first sales miss as a public company (while beating again on EPS) thanks to a strong dollar. At least 6 firms (perhaps reacting to the stock price more than earnings) have hiked their targets.

Many bulls are focusing on Facebook's huge video traffic growth. FBN: ""[T]he company had >4B video [views] per day in FQ1, up from >3B in FQ4 and >1B in FQ3. Moreover, mobile is a key driver here as over 75% of FB video [views] are done on mobile."" FBR notes video ad prices can be 10-20x display prices on a CPM basis, and expects ""ad tech investments in Atlas, LiveRail, and the FB audience network should grease the tracks to enable more video ads.”

Barclays thinks there ""may be significant upside to revenue given tailwinds on both [video] inventory and pricing."" SunTrust sees video, Dynamic Product Ads (allow advertisers to quickly promote products from their catalog to targeted users), and a Buy button all acting as 2015 growth drivers.
Pac Crest (Sector Perform), on the other hand, thinks Instagram and video won't be major 2015 revenue contributors. It also observes Q1 ""was the first quarter since early 2013 when total [ad] impressions grew sequentially and price per ad declined sequentially,"" which leads it to think the impact of the mobile shift and lower right-column ad inventory are mostly finished. On a Y/Y basis, impressions fell 62% and ad prices rose 285%. On CNBC (video), Alpha One Capital's Dan Niles says he sold Facebook into earnings on account of its run-up, but still calls it his favorite company.
On the CC (transcript), Facebook cut its 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP spending growth guidance on the high end by 5% to 55%-65% and 50%-60%, respectively. Also: While declining to promise Oculus will do a commercial launch this year (its VR headsets are still in beta), CFO Dave Wehner stated 2015 expense guidance ""reflects any volumes that we might do in 2015.""
Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, stated Facebook now handles over 1B daily mobile searches, that the average Instagram user spends 21 minutes/day on the service, and that Facebook handles over 45B messages/day across its platforms. Sheryl Sandberg noted Facebook/Instagram account for over 1/5 of all U.S. mobile time spent.

1245,Facebook's Q1 ad sales hurt by strong dollar; MAUs up to 1.44B,"Apr. 22, 2015, 4:34 PM","

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) ad revenue rose 46% Y/Y in Q1 to $3.54B, a slight slowdown from Q4's 53% growth. However, ad growth would've been at 55% in Q1 (and  58% in Q4) if not for a strong dollar. With  many already expecting heavy forex pressures, the Street hasn't reacted too harshly thus far to Facebook's Q1 sales miss.
Payments/other fees revenue, hurt by the shift from PC to mobile gaming, fell 5% to $226M after rising 7% in Q4. Mobile was 73% of ad revenue vs. 69% in Q4 and 66% in Q3.
Monthly active users (MAUs) rose 4% Q/Q and 13% Y/Y to 1.44B. Mobile MAUs rose 5% Q/Q and 24% Y/Y to 1.25B. Daily active users (936M) equaled 65% of MAUs, up slightly from Q4's 64%. Mobile-only MAUs (581M) are now 40% of total MAUs.
Facebook is making good on its promise to spend aggressively: Costs/expenses (non-GAAP) rose 57% Y/Y to $1.7B, eclipsing revenue growth of 42%. On a GAAP basis, R&D spend was 30% of revenue vs. 18% a year ago, thanks in part to stock compensation spend rising to 16% from 8%; sales/marketing spend was 17% vs. 13%, and G&A 8% vs. 7%. Cost of revenue was flat at 18%. $502M was spent on capex, up from $363M a year ago.
Nonetheless, free cash flow rose 30% to $1.2B, slightly exceeding non-GAAP net income. Facebook ended Q1 with $12.4B in cash/investments, and no debt.
The U.S./Canada (less than 15% of MAUs) accounted for 49% of revenue. U.S./Canada ARPU rose 42% Y/Y to $8.32, and global ARPU 25% to $2.50.

FB -1.8% AH to $83.15.

1247,"Facebook reportedly shows interest in Nokia maps unit, launches dialer app (updated)","Apr. 22, 2015, 2:50 PM","

Ahead of Facebook's (FB +1.1%) afternoon Q1 report, Germany's Manager Magazin reports the social networking giant has expressed interest in Nokia's (NOK +1.7%) HERE mapping/navigation services unit. Uber, a consortium of German automakers, and a P-E firm have also reportedly shown interest.
The report comes after Nokia stated it's exploring options for HERE ahead of a planned merger with Alcatel-Lucent. The unit, which has had a tough time competing against Google Maps in Web/mobile mapping but has fared better in the automotive market, has been assigned a book value of €2B ($2.14B) by Nokia; many think it can fetch a higher price.
Facebook's PC site currently relies on Bing Maps, and its mobile apps on Google Maps. Owning a mapping platform could help Facebook deliver a better experience when integrating user/business data and local services with maps.
Separately, Facebook has launched Hello, an Android phone dialer app that relies on publicly-shared Facebook profile info to provide caller ID data and photos. No iOS version will launch due to Apple's app restrictions.
Hello (currently available in the U.S., Brazil, and Nigeria) also adds Facebook profile pictures and info to a user's contact book, integrates with Messenger to support free VoIP calls, and features a search bar that can be used to search for contacts/businesses. Much like the Home Android UI (hasn't lived up to expectations), it aims to strengthen Facebook's mindshare and engagement with Android users.
Shares are higher ahead of earnings. Though generally expecting strong numbers, several analysts have been slightly cautious due to forex concerns and high expectations; ad partner Nanigans recently reported solid Q1 figures.

Update (6:40PM ET): Bloomberg also reports Nokia, German automakers, and P-E firms are looking at HERE. It adds Nokia has reached out to Apple, Alibaba, Baidu, Amazon, Sirius, and Harman. First-round bids are reportedly due at the end of next week.

1248,WhatsApp tops 800M active users; Facebook ad partner sees strong Q1,"Apr. 18, 2015, 5:18 PM","

WhatsApp (NASDAQ:FB) has surpassed 800M monthly active users (MAUs) 3 months after reaching 700M, co-founder/CEO Jan Koum shares on his Facebook page. Given the pace of growth, the world's most popular mobile messaging platform has a good shot of reaching 1B before year's end.
The disclosure comes 3 weeks after WhatsApp began supporting VoIP calls on its Android app (iOS support is on the way), a move that makes it an even bigger headache for carriers who have seen WhatsApp eat into their SMS cash cow - over 30B WhatsApp messages are now sent daily, topping global SMS traffic of 20B/day. In spite of the friction, WhatsApp has struck deals with dozens of carriers, often for providing unlimited access to its services for a small monthly fee.
WhatsApp's MAU base is ~200M larger than Facebook Messenger's, which recently topped 600M; Instagram has over 300M MAUs, and Facebook proper had 1.39B at the end of Q4. Whereas Facebook launched a 3rd-party app platform for Messenger last month, WhatsApp, which is mostly monetized via $1/year subscription fees charged in some markets, has no plans to launch something similar. Its mobile messaging share is huge in Europe and various emerging markets (e.g. India, Brazil), but relatively small in the U.S., Japan, and China.
Meanwhile ahead of Facebook's Wednesday Q1 report, ad partner Nanigans has reported a 17% Q/Q and 260% Y/Y increase in its customers' Facebook ad click rates (CTRs). Their ad prices fell 17% Q/Q and rose 4% Y/Y for ads sold on a cost per click (CPC) basis, and fell 3% Q/Q and rose 273% Y/Y for ads sold on a cost per 1K impression (CPM) basis. While seasonality played a role in the Q/Q drops, it's worth noting e-commerce ad CPCs were also down 14% Y/Y; gaming CPCs and e-commerce/gaming CPMs were all up strongly Y/Y.
Video ad spend among Nanigans clients rose 180% Q/Q, as Facebook continues ramping video ad products launched last year. Spending on multi-product ads (launched last summer, support 3-5 images and links) rose 420% Q/Q.

 Major social data/analytics provider DataSift has announced its licensing deal to access Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) data firehose will expire on Aug. 13, after Twitter suspended negotiations. Twitter, which bought DataSift rival Gnip last year, states ""companies building analytic solutions using Twitter’s data and platform"" will now ""need to have a direct relationship with Twitter."" 
Twitter insists those accessing its firehose via third parties won't see an impact, other than that they'll now pay Twitter directly. ""Direct relationships help Twitter develop a deeper understanding of customer needs, get direct feedback for the product roadmap, and work more closely with data customers...""
DataSift, which provides data from 20 sources besides Twitter, has a different view of things. ""80% of our customers use technology that can’t be replaced by Twitter ... social networks make money from engagement and advertising. Revenue from data should be a secondary concern to distribution...""
The company uses the occasion to praise Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) more liberal stance towards data access. DataSift partnered with Facebook last month to launch Topic Data, a solution that lets advertisers access mountains of anonymized Facebook content (including status updates, comments, likes and shares) sorted by topic, to better gauge consumer sentiment.
DataSift on the Facebook deal: ""For the first time, aggregate analysis is enabled across the entirety of Facebook users – not just the public profiles ... We are now providing our clients with the most powerful tool in the world for understanding consumer opinion."" Facebook, which hopes Topic Data will help brands deliver better targeted ads (any by doing so, lead them to spend more on Facebook ads), isn't charging DataSift for now.
Twitter's data licensing/other revenue rose 110% Y/Y in 2014 to $147.3M (10% of total revenue). IBM, which has launched enterprise analytics services for mining Twitter data, was recently added as a client.  "

With Contrafund pushing $113B in AUM, Danoff - on advice from Warren Buffett to bet big on the best ideas - has trimmed the number of stocks in the portfolio to 350 from 500.

Others in the strong growth at a reasonable price category are Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM).
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""Don't sell after the first double,"" says Danoff, believing the migration to mobile means the company will continue to increase its current $6 in revenue per U.S. user.

1253,Zuckerberg downplays Facebook/Google rivalry,"Mar. 26, 2015, 6:59 PM","

Though Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are squaring off more than ever following yesterday's Facebook F8 conference product launches, none of it is intentional, insists Mark Zuckerberg in a Wired interview.
Zuck: ""To the extent that we are doing measurement and Google did measurement, that’s just because Google is smart and they also realize that measurement is valuable ... Same on the video front ... we are not thinking about how we are competing with YouTube. We are thinking about how are we going to make it more useful for people to share stuff on Facebook.""
Facebook's launch of a mobile ad exchange (competes against Google's DoubleClick, leverages Facebook data) and embedded video support (YouTube dominates video embeds) has led to more than a few headlines declaring Facebook is out to take Google's lunch. The companies already compete in multiple ad markets.
On the mobile ad exchange front, at least, the competitive overlap might be less than some think. As Foreester's Jim Nail observes, DoubleClick's exchange, much like Google search, focuses on intent-based advertising (i.e. ads for items users have recently expressed interest in), while Facebook's natural strength is targeting based on a user's historical likes.
Other Facebook F8 news: 1) Facebook has provided details about Aquila, a solar-powered drone that will have a wingspan similar to a Boeing 767, and be used lasers to beam Web access to underserved regions. Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace last year. 2) Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash promises big things for virtual reality, once tech challenges are resolved. ""Virtual reality -- done right -- truly is reality as far as the observer is concerned ... It's clear that VR has the potential to change almost everything about the way we live.""

Continuing its flurry of F8 conference announcements, Facebook (FB -2.5%) states publishers will now be able to embed videos on other sites; all they have to do is click on an ""embed"" button and copy/paste some code. The move makes Facebook a bigger threat to YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG); it's already a major indirect rival to the online video giant.
Confirming a recent Bloomberg report, Facebook is launching (via its LiveRail video ad unit) a mobile ad exchange that lets 3rd-party publishers sell both display and video ads with the help of Facebook data. The solution takes aim at Google's DoubleClick and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) MoPub units.
Facebook's Parse mobile developer tool unit has launched SDKs for creating apps that run on embedded/wearable devices (the proverbial Internet of Things). Meanwhile, Facebook proper is showing off Analytics for Apps,a dashboard that provides stats on how a Facebook-enabled app is being used (and who's using it) across multiple platforms; the solution includes tools for measuring ad performance.
Disclosed: 1) Native ad formats account for over half of all Facebook Audience Network (mobile ad network, launched last year) ads. 2) Over 400K developers now use Parse's tools. 3) Over 1B apps have now been installed via Facebook's app install ads.
After getting a brief bounce, Facebook has sold off to new intraday lows. The Nasdaq is now down 1.9%.

Mark Zuckerberg has kicked off Facebook's (FB -1.2%) F8 developer conference by disclosing Messenger MAUs have topped 600M (up from November's 500M), and that Facebook Groups users now top 700M. WhatsApp is still said to be above 700M (as announced in January). A Bloomberg column previously mentioned Facebook's Messenger user base had reached 700M, but no longer does so.
Zuck has also unveiled (confirming a recent TechCrunch report) the Messenger Platform, which allows 3rd-party developers to integrate their apps with Messenger. Over 40 apps are initially supported, including ESPN, The Weather Channel, Imgur, and a slew of independent content/media apps such as JibJab, PicCollage, and UltraText; an SDK rolls out today. Disclosed along the way: Messenger now handles 10% of all VoIP phone calls.
Also launching: Businesses on Messenger, a solution that lets businesses use Messenger to chat with and send alerts to consumers (and vice versa).

Long a huge referral traffic source for the many online media firms that provide excerpts and links for their material on the company's site and apps, Facebook (FB +1%) is now in talks with at least a half-dozen media firms to fully host their content in exchange for a chance to profit from related ad revenue, the NYT reports.
The NYT itself is said to be one of the publishers Facebook is talking to, as are viral content giant BuzzFeed and National Geographic. Tests are expected to begin in ""the next several months."" Some publishers are reportedly wary of Facebook's overtures out of fear of losing site traffic and control over the user experience.
Facebook could pitch publishers on providing a quicker/more seamless content-viewing experience, as well as on countering the rising popularity of video on Facebook - the social networking giant's video views have soared to over 3B/day following the launch of autoplay videos.
Facebook hasn't been shy about wanting to act as a media platform for its 1.39B MAUs, though readers still often engage more with viral content than longer-form material. The NYT's report follows a December video clip deal with the NFL for which Facebook is sharing revenue produced by Verizon ads run against the NFL's content.

 Following the lead of Line, WeChat, Snapchat, and other mobile messaging platforms, Facebook (FB +1.9%) will use its March 25-26 F8 developers' conference to ""announce new ways for third parties to offer experiences through its Messenger app,"" multiple sources tell TechCrunch

Facebook will initially ""focus on how third parties can build ways for content and information to flow through Messenger,"" and (depending on how the initial efforts go) might later support more features. No word on whether WhatsApp, which has taken a very minimalist approach to its service, will follow suit.
Line and WeChat have turned into huge revenue generators through their support for gaming, payments/e-commerce, stickers, and other value-added services, as well as ads. Line, owned by Korea's Naver (OTCPK:NHNCF), had Q4 revenue of $198.7M (+62% Y/Y) via just 181M MAUs; 60% of its revenue comes from games. Facebook recently told Bloomberg Messenger's user base has risen to 700M.
TechCrunch adds Facebook, which just added P2P payments support to Messenger (it's not collecting transaction fees for now), is intent on avoiding the spamming that took place for apps on its site (largely via game developers). Mark Zuckerberg has previously suggested he's not a fan of monetizing messaging platforms via ads.

After dropping slightly yesterday following news Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is giving Messenger users the ability to send money to each other (though not to merchants), EBAY is seeing steeper losses today. Volume (11M shares) has exceeded a 3-month daily average of 8.5M.
Unlike PayPal, Facebook doesn't plan to charge transaction fees for the time being. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested he isn't interested in monetizing Messenger until it hits 1B users.
Though P2P money transfers are a small portion of PayPal's transaction volume, Facebook's service could substantially grow the number of payment card numbers it has on file. The company is in the midst of testing (with the help of PayPal rival Stripe) a Buy button that lets users pay for advertised items without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using previously-saved card data.
Buried within a Bloomberg column about Facebook's payments launch: Facebook says it now has 700M Messenger users. The company reported having 500M MAUs back in November.

Facebook (FB +1.7%) is updating its PC and mobile Messenger apps to allow users to send cash (via debit cards) to friends. A user sending money simply has to tap a $ icon, enter an amount, and tap a Pay button; a PIN can be created to provide security.
Facebook is less than a year removed from hiring ex-PayPal chief David Marcus to run Messenger. Mark Zuckerberg, for his part, has suggested for a while payments will be a part of Facebook's efforts to monetize Messenger, which has 500M+ MAUs thanks in part to Facebook's decision to remove messaging functionality from its core apps.
Many think WhatsApp, currently monetized in some markets via subscription fees, will eventually join rival messaging platforms in supporting payments. Facebook has promised it won't run ads on WhatsApp, and has more broadly argued ads aren't a good way to monetize messaging apps.
PayPal owner eBay (EBAY -0.1%) has ticked lower following Facebook's announcement. For now, Facebook's platform doesn't support merchant payments, which account for a far larger percentage of PayPal's transaction volume than consumer-to-consumer payments.

""There is no fear in Silicon Valley right now,"" proclaims Benchmark VC Bill Gurley, once more raising alarm bells about a perceived bubble in private tech funding and valuations. He predicts some ""unicorns"" - startups with $1B+ valuations, a club whose ranks have swelled rapidly over the last couple of years - will go belly-up in 2015.
Gurley expects Facebook (FB -0.7%) to be one of the companies hurt by the shakeout, given its dependence on mobile app install ads that are often sold to startups looking to gain exposure for their apps. Though Facebook hasn't given an exact number, install ads are believed to account for a large portion of the company's mobile ad sales, which in turn were 69% of its total Q4 ad revenue.
Gurley's remarks come as The Information reports Facebook will use its March 25-26 f8 conference to unveil tools that let developers track the performance of install ads both on Facebook and 3rd-party apps. Google and Twitter entered the install ad market last year; Google, which currently places install ads within mobile search results, is set to expand its offerings to include ads placed within the Google Play app.
Other Facebook news: 1) BofA/Merrill argues today Instagram is worth up to $37B, and WhatsApp up to $32B. It thinks each platform could eventually deliver ~$4B/year in revenue, and that Instagram's MAU count could top 500M next year. Cowen recently gave Instagram a $33B valuation. 2) Facebook has updated its community standards to clarify its stance on adult content, hate speech, regulated goods, and several other matters.

While announcing the deal, TheFind says its search engine will be shuttered within the next few weeks, but adds it will be ""working hard to integrate our technology to make the ads you see on Facebook every day better and more relevant to you.""
A source talking to AdWeek states Facebook will use TheFind to deliver better retargeted ads (i.e. ads based on activity on non-Facebook sites/apps), something that could yield better ROIs and ad prices. ""Say you're looking at a pair of jeans on the Gap's website. You won't see those ads after you buy them.""
Facebook already does plenty of business selling retargeted e-commerce ads within its news feed, and on its site's right-hand column. However, delivering relevant product ads to consumers is still often a challenge, as it is for many other retargeted ad platforms.
The acquisition comes just a month after Facebook launched a news feed ad unit meant specifically for product ads, and for which ads are tailored to a user's activity and interests. The company has also been testing out a Buy button that could improve ad ROIs/prices by allowing users to make purchases without leaving Facebook's site/apps, using payment data previously saved to their accounts.

1262,WSJ: Google building virtual reality version of Android,"Mar. 7, 2015, 2:17 PM","

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has ""assembled a team of engineers to build a version of the Android operating system to power virtual-reality applications,"" two sources tell the WSJ. ""Tens of engineers"" are said to be working on the project, which was launched in the wake of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) $2B 2014 acquisition of early VR hardware/software leader Oculus.
The report comes as industry investments in VR platforms accelerate rapidly. In addition to Facebook/Oculus, Sony, HTC, and multiple startups have projects in various stages of development. Sony just promised its gaming-focused Morpheus VR headset would launch in 1H16; HTC showed off its Vive headset at the Mobile World Congress.
Last year, Google launched Cardboard, a cheap prototype kit meant to get developers to start writing VR apps for Android. Oculus, meanwhile, has partnered with Samsung to launch the Gear VR, a headset line that relies on Samsung (Android) phones to provide the device's display and camera; a full commercial launch is expected later this year. Oculus has also bought multiple startups to help maintain its tech lead.
""Virtual reality is bigger than gaming,"" Oculus CTO John Carmack proclaimed at this week's Game Developers Conference (GDC). Mark Zuckerberg at the time of the Oculus deal announcement: ""Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles ... Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.'
GPU leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD are also going after the opportunity: Nvidia used GDC to show off several VR game demos powered by its GPUs; its Maxwell GPU line has already been optimized for VR. AMD used GDC to launch LiquidVR, a VR developer SDK for its GPUs that improves head-tracking and reduces latency/stuttering, and by doing so aims to eliminate motion sickness (still a common user complaint).

1263,Facebook reportedly working on new mobile ad platform; Twitter falls,"Mar. 4, 2015, 11:37 AM","


Bloomberg reports Facebook (FB +0.8%) is working on a mobile ad platform for 3rd-party apps that would compete against Twitter's (TWTR -2%) popular MoPub mobile ad server/exchange platform for publishers. Twitter is lower following the news.
Bloomberg adds Facebook could unveil the offering at its annual f8 developer's conference (March 25-26), and might also make several other ad announcements at the time.
Facebook used last year's f8 conference to launch its Audience Network, which allows advertisers to sell ads on 3rd-party apps while leveraging Facebook data and targeting tools. The company later launched a revamped version of its Atlas ad-serving/measurement platform that links measurement of both Facebook and non-Facebook ads to user profiles.
Whereas Audience Network provides a set of Facebook ad units for publishers and advertisers, MoPub is a publisher-centric (i.e. supply-side) platform that gives developers a variety of tools (and access to many ad-buying platforms) for monetizing their ad inventory. Thus, creating a MoPub rival would represent an expansion of Facebook's efforts to act as an ad partner for app publishers.
Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) AdMob is a major player in this space. Millennial Media (MM -0.9%) remains a notable independent player, in spite of its recent struggles.

The device will track head's movements as precisely as one-tenth of a degree, and will include a Steam VR base station, which will let users walk around the virtual space instead of using a controller.

 Less than two years after reaching 1M advertisers and seven months after disclosing it has hit 1.5M, Facebook (FB -0.7%) says it now has over 2M active advertisers on its site and apps. In tandem with the announcement, Facebook has launched Ads Manager, an app that helps marketers create and edit ads, track the performance of live ads, receive related notifications, and edit ad budgets and schedules. An iOS version is currently available in the U.S., and will be available globally within a few weeks. An Android version will arrive later this year. Facebook has rolled out many tools over the last two years meant to give advertisers better audience data and more advanced targeting options. It's also busy working on tools aimed at improving ad performance measurement (including offline conversions). Those efforts are a big reason Facebook's average ad price rose 335% Y/Y in Q4, more than offsetting a 65% drop in ad impressions caused by an ongoing traffic shift to mobile (where less ads are shown).

He sees Instagram's MAU count (recently topped 300M) rising to 680M by 2020, and notes 72% of its users are aged 18-44. With Blackledge valuing Facebook Messenger at $10.5B and taking WhatsApp's $22B acquisition price at face value, he sees 23%-36% upside for Facebook's valuation on a sum-of-the-parts basis. For now, his target remains at $91. The note comes in a week that has seen Bloomberg report Snapchat could be valued at $19B in a new funding round, and the WSJ report Pinterest is seeking an $11B valuation in a new round. Separately, during a recent conference talk, Facebook product chief Chris Cox stated his company is working on virtual reality apps (presumably for Oculus' platform) and that Facebook is talking with publishers about getting them to fully publish (rather than just excerpt/link to) their content on Facebook, in exchange for a revenue cut.

Facebook at Work, first reported on by the FT in November, has been made available via app stores to select enterprise test partners. The platform looks a lot like standard Facebook (FB +0.4%) - it contains a news feed, messaging tools, and groups - and lets users log in with their regular Facebook accounts. But a user's professional data is completely split off from his/her personal data, and Facebook won't collect any of it.
Moreover, unlike LinkedIn (LNKD +0.1%), Facebook at Work is only focused (for now) on connecting with co-workers, thus arguably making it more of a rival to Jive Software (JIVE -0.3%), Salesforce's Chatter platform, and Microsoft's Yammer. LinkedIn and Jive both sold off following the November FT report.
With no ads being sold, corporate subscriptions are a potential revenue stream. Facebook can count on its giant, highly engaged user base to drive interest in Work. At the same time, it has to contend with corporate wariness towards Facebook, historically viewed by many of them as a productivity-killer.
Separately, Oppenheimer and Credit Suisse have respectively hiked their Facebook targets to $100 and $102. Oppenheimer expects a strong Q4 report on Jan. 28.

Facebook Search (FB -0.5%) has been updated to support searching for keywords within posts, photos, and other content that has previously appeared in a user's news feed. The feature is initially launching to PC and iOS users; Android support will arrive later.
For now, Facebook doesn't plan to sell mobile search ads, or any new keyword-based ads in general. But as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can vouch, offering such ads could prove very lucrative long-term. While Facebook has a treasure trove of data about its users, it knows relatively little (compared with Google and other search engines) about what a user is interested in buying at a particular moment. Keyword searches can help change that.
Product manager Rosseau Kazi says Facebook also plans to eventually provide keyword searches for publicly-shared posts, a move that would make it a bigger indirect threat to traditional search engines. ""Facebook has a wealth of information you can’t get anywhere else.""
Facebook is also finally bringing Graph Search to mobile. Though launched to much fanfare in early 2013, Graph Search hasn't lived up to expectations thus far, as users found its approach to queries (for example, searching for all friends who live in Seattle who work for Starbucks) too complicated relative to standard search.

With the former's ad sales and impressions far larger than the latter's, cross-platform measurement could provide a much better view of an Instagram ad's performance.
Given Instagram ads often consist of magazine-style brand ads, judging their performance solely based on clicks and resulting online purchases/conversions can be misleading. ""The current way we measure digital is flawed,"" says Facebook VP Brian Boland. Aside from Atlas, Facebook is relying on offline purchase data to get a better read on an ad's effectiveness.

Continuing its efforts to build (in Mark Zuckerberg's words) ""a pipeline of experiences"" on mobile, Facebook (FB +0.3%) has created standalone Android/iOS apps for monitoring and interacting with one's groups.
Group-related notifications are provided through the app, as is a Discover tab that recommends groups based on a user's interests. However, unlike with messaging, Facebook won't be removing Groups functionality from its core apps.
The Groups launch follows the October release of Rooms, an app that allows users to create discussion spaces while logging in with pseudonyms.
Separately, Hilliard Lyons' Stephen Turner has launched coverage on Facebook with a Buy rating and $92 target. Like others, Turner cites Facebook's ability to benefit from a shift in ad spend towards online/mobile channels - mobile still only accounts for 11% of U.S. ad spend vs. 25% of media time.

LinkedIn (LNKD -4%) is seeing profit-taking after the FT reported Facebook (FB -0.7%) is planning to launch a business-focused version of its core service that will support separate work accounts and feature collaboration tools. Enterprise social networking software vendor Jive (JIVE -5.9%) is also selling of.
Salesforce (CRM -1.5%), whose Chatter business social networking platform has seen strong growth, is off moderately. The Nasdaq is down 0.4%.
Facebook's service will be able to lean on the company's 1.35B-strong active user base, as well as its very high Web and mobile app engagement rates (much higher than LinkedIn's).
At the same time, the offering will have to contend with corporate wariness towards Facebook (due to Facebook's historical consumer focus and reputation as a productivity-killer), as well as LinkedIn's established base of professional accounts (332M at the end of Q3) and the popularity of business social networking tools from the likes of Jive, Salesforce, Microsoft, and IBM.

The revised text includes passages noting Facebook's use of location data to provide business recommendations and other content, as well as its collection of transactional data. Facebook also notes users can opt out of receiving ads that are based on non-Facebook activity.
Re/code's Peter Kafka observes Facebook's revisions pave the way for new payments/e-commerce services, as well as location-based ads.

Less than seven months after Mark Zuckerberg disclosed Facebook Messenger (FB -0.6%) had 200M monthly active users, Facebook states Messenger has topped 500M.The massive growth, of course, was driven by Facebook's decision to remove messaging functionality from its core apps, thereby forcing users to download the standalone Messenger apps. A backlash ensued; the latest version of the iOS app still has a rating of only 1.5/5 stars in the App Store due to users upset about the new requirement (its cumulative rating is 3/5 stars).Nonetheless, the requirement has led Messenger's MAU count to soar past that of all other mobile messaging platforms save for Facebook-owned WhatsApp (has over 600M), and grow to equal nearly 40% of Facebook's Q3-ending MAU base of 1.35B.Facebook put ex-PayPal chief David Marcus in charge of Messenger in June, and has suggested it plans to monetize the platform via payments.

1294,"Zuck: Facebook optimizes news feed for users, not businesses","Nov. 8, 2014, 10:12 AM","

""There's this inherent conflict ... Are we trying to optimize news feed to give each person, all of you guys, the best experience when you’re reading? Or are we trying to help businesses just reach as many people as possible? And in every decision that we make, we optimize for the first,"" says Mark Zuckerberg (NASDAQ:FB) addressing concerns from businesses that their Facebook organic reach (i.e. their ability to reach followers without paying for ads) is steadily declining.
Zuck observes the average Facebook user is eligible to see ~1,500 news feed updates per day, but only ends up seeing ~100 - Facebook's algorithms are largely responsible for picking out which ones are seen. As users add more ""friends"" and follow more pages, their eligible content grows, and their odds of seeing a particular post declines.
The upshot? Businesses increasingly need to buy Facebook ads in order to keep the rate at which their content is seen from declining. And since the number of posts viewed per user (ads or otherwise) is staying fairly constant, growing ad demand serves to boost ad prices.
Zuck's remarks come as Facebook updates its news feed controls to make it easier for users to unfollow users, pages, and groups, and gives them the option to see less of particular users/pages/groups without unfollowing them. Affected businesses will, of course, end up with less organic exposure.

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) aggressive 2015 spending forecast isn't driven by any particular field, but by large investments in everything from the core service to ad tech to new products, CFO Dave Wehner insisted on the CC. He suggested much of the new spending will be on hiring. (live blogs: I, II)
Price per ad soared 274% Y/Y in Q3, thanks in part to an overhaul of Facebook's right-hand column PC ads (they typically carry lower prices). With total ad revenue up ""only"" 64%, ad impressions fell 56% (fewer ads are shown on mobile).
PC ad sales rose 11% Y/Y, but were flat Q/Q. Though payments/other revenue rose 13% Y/Y, payments volume from games fell 2% due to lower PC gaming activity (a negative for ZNGA, which is down 1% AH).
Sheryl Sandberg notes only 11% of ad budgets are for mobile, and predicts improving inaccurate measurement systems (previous) will boost ROI and spending. She reiterates Facebook will take it slow in ramping Instagram and video ads, and that Facebook is aiming for Instagram to eventually have 1B users of its own (up over 4x from current levels).
Mark Zuckerberg cautions Oculus is unlikely to see 50M-100M unit shipments in the next few years, but reiterates he wants Oculus' VR headsets to be a mass-market product long-term. He also states Facebook plans to make new investments in growing public content viewing/sharing, where its focus on privately connecting friends/family can make for a tricky balancing act.
Facebook discloses WhatsApp (just beginning to monetize) had 2013 revenue of just $10.2M, and a loss of $138M ($98.8M from stock compensation).
Other details: 1) Of the 33M MAUs added in Q3, only 6M came from North America and Europe. 2) ARPU rose to $2.40 from $2.24 in Q2 and $1.72 a year ago. North American ARPU ($7.39) remains an outlier. 3) 456M MAUs (34% of them) are mobile-only.

Invites to an individual room can be obtained by taking a picture or screenshot of a room's QR code.The app, vaguely outlined in an Oct. 7 NYT report, is arguably a response by Facebook to the popularity of pseudonymous discussion platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and legions of Web message boards, and a recognition of the limits on discussion that stem from Facebook's real-identity requirement and focus on connecting with friends/family.Josh Miller, head of the team responsible for Rooms: ""We don’t want this to be a place where you talk to friends ...

Meanwhile, Facebook partner Nanigans (provides software for managing Facebook ad campaigns) reports (.pdf) its clients saw their ad click rates rise 56% Q/Q and 195% Y/Y to 0.56%. Y/Y growth improved from 146% in Q2.
The average prices for 1K ads sold on a CPM basis rose 80% Q/Q and 298% Y/Y to $2.98, while the average price for individual ads sold on a CPC basis fell 4% Q/Q and rose 30% Y/Y to $0.53. Mobile made up 62% of spending, up from 56% in Q2.
Nanigans attributes the huge CPM growth to strong demand for news feed ads - their CPM rose 153% Y/Y to $5.62 - declining interest in cheaper right-hand column ads, larger right-hand column ad units, and (perhaps more interestingly) a 38% Q/Q increase in the use Facebook's Optimized CPM platform, which gives advertisers more control over campaigns and delivers better targeting.

The app's reported goal is to allow users to ""use multiple pseudonyms to openly discuss the different things they talk about on the Internet; topics of discussion which they may not be comfortable connecting to their real names."" It's unknown if the app will interact with Facebook's core site and apps, or whether it will support anonymous photo-sharing.
At its spring f8 conference, Facebook introduced anonymous login support for 3rd-party apps. However, Zuck and other Facebook execs have defended requiring users of the company's core services to rely on their real-world identities.
Facebook's real-identity requirement is ""part of what made Facebook special in the first place,"" product chief Chris Cox recently asserted. However, the role pseudonym support has played in fueling the growth of Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and other platforms undoubtedly isn't lost on Facebook.
Five months after launching, Facebook's mobile ad network (relies on Facebook data to deliver targeted ads on other sites/apps), has been opened up to all developers.

With Facebook promising not to sell ads on WhatsApp, and many of the service's users having low incomes, monetization remains a question mark. Aside from the $1/year subscription fees now collected in some markets, payments appear to be a possibility.

As previously reported, the revamped Atlas uses Facebook profile info to allow advertisers to track the performance of Facebook and non-Facebook ads, and (leveraging Facebook data) also allows them to make automated ad buys for inventory on 3rd-party sites/apps.
Instagram and ad giant Omnicom are among the first supporters. Marin Software (MRIN -0.3%) is among the ad tech supporters - its platform will be integrated with Atlas to allow clients to better measure their ROI on search ad campaigns.
Interestingly, Re/code reports hearing Facebook has ""talked to Twitter"" about supporting Atlas. The site adds some think Facebook's main goal with the platform is to leverage the data it obtains about 3rd-party ad sales to improve the effectiveness of its internal ad sales.
Instagram has been blocked in China as protests erupt in Hong Kong. Until now, the photo-sharing platform has been available in China even as Facebook's core services are generally blocked. Many Chinese celebrities claim 100K+ Instagram followers.

Stifel's Scott Devitt (formerly at Morgan Stanley) has raised his Facebook target by $4 to $99 (a new Street high), citing the potential for rapid video ad growth. Devitt notes global digital video ad spend has been forecast to post a 29% CAGR from 2013-2018 (growing to $21.6B), and thinks Facebook can deliver 2016 video ad sales of $346M.

Penetration rates are especially high in several major emerging markets, some of which are also big WhatsApp markets. India is at 57%, the Philippines at 59%, Mexico at 51%, and Brazil at 46%.

The figures exclude Instagram, whose user base has a large U.S. component, and also WhatsApp.
In spite of the usage growth, Facebook's share of U.S. social media time has fallen to 33.3% from a 2011 peak of 40%. Likewise, its share of U.S. digital time spent has slipped to 6% from 6.5%. On the other hand, with digital continuing to grab media share, Facebook's share of total media time spent has grown to 2.8% from 2.2%.
Meanwhile, with Facebook's ad sales having soared over the last two years thanks to an all-out monetization push (especially on mobile), eMarketer estimates the company now has a 9.7% share of U.S. digital ad spend, 370 bps above its digital time share. By contrast, all other social networks claim just a 3.9% share of U.S. digital ad spend, in spite of having an 11.9% share of time spent.
Likewise, Pandora (NYSE:P) is estimated to have only a 1.4% digital ad spend share vs. a 7.1% share of time spent. With the company spending aggressively to grow its ad salesforce, that gap could narrow in the coming years.
As is the case for many of its peers, the U.S. remains crucial to Facebook's top and bottom lines: North America still accounted for 44% of Q2 revenue, even though it was responsible for only 15% of MAUs.

The Gear VR, long rumored to be in the pipeline, relies on Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) just-announced Galaxy Note 4 to run Oculus VR's (FB -1.1%) software, and provide the device's display and sensors. For now, no other phones work with the device.
Unlike the gaming-focused Oculus Rift (still in beta), the Gear VR doesn't need a wired connection to a PC. Users interact with the headset through a trackpad and head movements. No price details have been given yet.

Initial testers are intrigued by the Gear VR's potential, but are also quick to point out content/game support and software/UI development are still very much works in progress. Samsung/Oculus promise a content store will soon be available, and note initial content partners include DreamWorks, Warner Bros., Fox, and Marvel.
Facebook was recently reported to be working with Hollywood on Oculus deals. Meanwhile, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe has made it clear he considers OEM deals crucial to his firm's efforts to drive mass adoption of its platform, which has a solid head-start on rivals from a software standpoint.

Mark Zuckerberg has long been confident WhatsApp will eventually have over 1B users, and has even reportedly suggested WhatsApp could eventually have a bigger base than Facebook proper. Facebook claimed 1.32B MAUs at the end of Q2.
Meanwhile, comScore estimates Facebook's core app had 115.4M U.S. unique visitors in June, 32M more than the second-most-popular U.S. app (YouTube) and good for a 72% penetration rate. Globally, Facebook had 1.07B mobile MAUs at the end of June.
comScore estimates Instagram had 46.6M U.S. users (#8 overall), and Facebook Messenger 39.2M (#12). WhatsApp, often used as an SMS replacement abroad, didn't crack the top-25, as U.S. users continue relying heavily on the SMS services often bundled with their mobile plans.
Not surprisingly, comScore's data also suggests core Facebook's U.S. base skews older, and Instagram's base skews younger. Whereas core Facebook accounts for 18.4% of the time spent on apps by U.S. users aged 35-54, it accounts for 14.8% among those aged 18-24.

The latest iOS version of Facebook Messenger, released after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) began requiring users to download a standalone Messenger app to send IMs to Facebook friends, has a rating of just 1/5 stars on the App Store. Over its entire lifetime, the app still has a rating of 4/5 stars.
Both Twitter and the reviews sections for the App Store/Google Play have been flooded with complaints about Facebook's requirement. ""I absolutely refuse to download another app just so I can chat on Facebook with my phone,"" writes one irate reviewer, echoing a common sentiment. Also: revised privacy terms have sparked some criticism.
Mark Zuckerberg has argued using a standalone Messenger app yields a better experience than using Messenger via the core Facebook app. Requiring a separate messaging app is part of a broader Facebook effort to provide a slew of apps optimized for specific services, and in doing so avoid being just one icon on an iOS/Android home screen.
Zuck has also suggested Facebook plans to add payments support to Messenger, which now has 200M+ MAUs and is run by ex-PayPal chief David Marcus. Facebook was recently reported to be thinking of adding support for Uber's car-hailing service to Messenger.
Meanwhile, Facebook's new Slingshot app, a would-be Snapchat rival that requires recipients of an ephemeral photo/video to reply with one of their own, has plummeted on App Store download charts. A few other recent Facebook products have met similar fates.

Jefferies makes a similar point. It adds Facebook's ""ever-deepening ties"" to e-commerce leave it well-positioned to ""capitalize on strong holiday shopping trends.""

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will make efforts to accept more payments on its platform, says Mark Zuckerberg on the Q2 CC following a question about Facebook's Buy button and related payments tools (still in testing). However, he adds advertising (92% of Q2 revenue) will remain the company's main business.
Zuck also reiterates (in spite of Facebook's efforts to grow public sharing) creating private spaces for users remains a core objective. He states Messenger (now run by ex-PayPal chief David Marcus) will play a pivotal role in furthering this goal. WhatsApp presumably will also play a role.
New CFO David Wehner states Facebook's ad prices effectively more than doubled Y/Y due to a shift towards more costly news feed/mobile ads (improved targeting also didn't hurt). This enabled ad sales to rise 67% in spite of a 25% drop in ad impressions.
Sheryl Sandberg notes the acquisition of video ad tech platform LiveRail will further Facebook's ad network ambitions; the company just recently launched its mobile ad network. She also declares marketers are getting more creative with Facebook campaigns, comparing them to TV campaigns in the process.

Clicking on the button allows users to buy a promoted item without leaving Facebook's site, and to save the payment info they provide for future purchases. The feature is being tested out with a handful of U.S. SMBs. Facebook isn't charging a transaction fee for now, but is open to doing so down the line.
While Facebook does plenty of business with e-commerce advertisers - Nanigans' Q2 numbers drive this home - users have until now had to leave Facebook to finish a transaction (virtual goods purchases excepted). If on-site purchasing improves conversion rates, Facebook can benefit either directly (by charging a fee) or indirectly (by charging higher ad prices).
Separately, Facebook has rolled out Mentions, a new app meant to help verified public figures interact better with their Facebook fans.
Facebook and Twitter have been battling for celebrity support for years. Each platform has its strengths: Twitter has been better at fostering conversations with fans, and Facebook has been better at getting out celebrity messages that require more than 140 characters.

As part of a push to grow emerging markets ad sales, Facebook (FB -1.3%) is testing ""missed call"" ads in India. The ads allow users to receive automated voice/text messages providing content (e.g. sports scores, music), along with a promotional message.
Facebook is also providing more custom ad options for foreign locales, and giving marketers the ability to target based on geographic data (already available in the U.S.).
Facebook still received 47% of its revenue from North America in Q1, even though the region accounted only 16% of its MAUs. North American ARPU ($5.85) dwarfed ARPUs for Europe ($2.44), Asia ($0.93), and all other markets ($0.70). Demographics make it virtually impossible to fully eliminate this gap, but narrowing it is a priority for the company.
Sheryl Sandberg has apologized for ""poorly"" communicating a controversial 2012 mood experiment. Facebook tweaked its news feed algorithm for ~700K users to see if changing the number of displayed positive or negative posts led users to post more positive or negative content. U.K. regulators plan to probe Facebook's actions.
Facebook says its App Links platform has been adopted by ""hundreds of apps"" (inc. Spotify, Hulu, and Vimeo) since launching on April 30, and has enabled over 1B links.

The app arrives after Facebook reportedly made a failed $3B+ bid to acquire Snapchat, prior to turning its sights on WhatsApp. Facebook's Poke app, its first attempt to take on Snapchat, was shuttered in May.

1343,Facebook buys startup to strengthen push for carrier deals,"Jun. 3, 2014, 10:10 AM","

Facebook (FB +0.2%) is buying Pryte, a Finnish startup that allows carriers to offer cheap, short-term mobile data packages covering popular individual apps. Terms are undisclosed.
Both Facebook proper and WhatsApp have been trying to strike deals with foreign carriers to provide subsidized access to their services; the latter has arguably made more progress than the former.
In April, WhatsApp launched a €10 ($14) prepaid SIM card in partnership with Germany's E-Plus that provided unlimited access to its services (no data charges).
A big chunk of the mobile messaging leader's base is in emerging markets where a piecemeal approach to mobile data services could go over well with cost-sensitive consumers.

Engadget reports Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is partnering with Oculus VR (NASDAQ:FB) to build a mobile/media-focused VR headset.
Not surprisingly, Oculus is said to be handling the product's software/UI, and Samsung the hardware. Unlike the gaming-focused Oculus Rift, the headset won't have a display of its own, but will instead (using a slot within the device) rely on a smartphone to act as its screen.
The phone's rear camera can allow a user to stay connected to the outside world, and might also enable augmented reality apps. Oculus is reportedly providing Samsung with an early version of its mobile SDK,
As part of the tie-up, Samsung is providing Oculus with OLED displays sporting resolutions above 1080p for its own hardware; Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) should be happy to hear that. The latest Rift dev. kit (DK2) features a 5"" 1080p OLED display.
Mark Zuckerberg has insisted from the start the Oculus deal is about enabling a wide variety of VR applications, of which gaming is just one.

Whereas smartphone penetration in the 15 biggest developed markets was at 65% at the end of 2013, it was only 23% for the 15 biggest emerging markets, notes Mary Meeker in a mobile-centric 2014 Internet Trends Report.
Global smartphone penetration has reached 22%, well above 11% penetration for laptops and 10% penetration for desktops. Tablets are still only at 6%, and mobile phones in general at 73%. There were 2.61B global Web users at the end of 2013, and 1.79B smartphone subs.
Mobile made up 25% of Internet traffic as of May 2014, up from 15% a year ago and 10% two years ago. Asia and Africa are respectively at 37% and 38%. Mobile accounts for over 1/5 of online video time (favorable for YouTube).
Internet ad sales grew 16% last year to $116B. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) had a Q1 annualized ad ARPU of $45 (up $3 Y/Y), dwarfing Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) $7.24 (up $2.84), and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) $3.55 (up $1.58). Mobile is estimated to account for 20% of media time spent, and just 4% of ad sales. For Internet, the figures are 25% and 22%.
Other details: 1) Tech firms account for 19% of the S&P 500's market cap - up from 11% 20 years ago, but well below a Dot.com bubble peak of  35%. 2) Web-connected TVs made up nearly 40% of 2013 shipments, up from <10% in 2010. 3) Facebook made up 21% of social media referral traffic in March (per Shareholic), and Twitter just 1%.

Facebook's (FB -1.3%) news feed video ads, launched in the U.S. in March following delays, will be arriving soon in the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, Canada, and Australia.
Sheryl Sandberg cautioned last month not to expect big 2014 sales for the 15-second ads, which automatically play without audio (a user has to click/tap on an ad for sound). Facebook, nervous about upsetting users, is taking a conservative approach to video ads - only a limited number of advertisers will initially offer them in the new markets.
But with the company reportedly charging advertisers six or even figures per day for large-scale campaigns, and TV advertisers steadily becoming more comfortable with online video, video ads have the potential to be a $1B+ long-term opportunity. NBC was recently signed up as a client.

The network was launched Facebook's f8 developer conference, during which Mark Zuckerberg has declared his company's motto has changed from ""move fast and break things"" to the less catchy ""move fast with stable infrastructure."" To back up the change, Zuck promises Facebook will now fix any bugs in newly-released code with 48 hours.
Facebook, aided by its Parse unit, has also used f8 to: 1) Update its login solution for 3rd-party apps to allow anoynmous logins, and to give users more control over what info they share. 2) Launch AppLinks.org, a solution for linking between installed apps.
In a Wired interview, Zuck highlights Facebook's interest in acting as a knowledge source for users, rather than just a sharing source - 5-10% of Facebook posts are questions to friends - and reiterates his interest in having Facebook's various developer services act as a cross-platform infrastructure for apps.

""Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is not one thing. On desktop where we grew up, the mode that made the most sense was to have a website ... In mobile there’s a big premium on creating single-purpose first-class experiences,"" says Mark Zuckerberg in an NYT interview, highlighting his company's focus on unbundling its various services on mobile, where screen real estate is limited and each app represents just one home screen icon.
The remarks follow a TechCrunch report stating Facebook plans to remove messaging from its core app, thereby requiring users who want the feature to download the standalone Messenger app (and potentially triggering a backlash).
Zuck adds Facebook want to ""build a pipeline of experiences"" for users, and that his company's Creative Labs unit is ""[exploring] things that aren’t all tied to Facebook identity."" Those remarks arguably speak to the popularity (particularly among certain demographics) of rival platforms that don't require real names.
He also suggests he's unfazed by the muted early reception for Graph Search, arguing it's a 5-year project more focused on mobile than PCs (where it launched).
Interviewer Farhad Manjoo, discussing Zuck's strategy: ""When was the last time you swooned over some new feature in Facebook? ... The more users you have, the harder it is to innovate, because most will be averse to any change ... By filtering its innovations into new apps that lack an established user base, engineers and designers can take creative leaps that may not have worked if they’d simply been adding features to Facebook’s primary app.""

The FTC's approval of the Facebook/WhatsApp (FB -4.6%) deal was widely expected, given Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp (though collectively having a sizable mobile messaging share) face competition from a long list of rivals that includes Line, Viber, Skype, and BlackBerry. EU approval remains outstanding.
Though signing off on the deal, the FTC cautions WhatsApp needs to honor existing privacy commitments made to its users; EU regulators have raised privacy concerns of their own. Facebook settled an FTC privacy probe in 2012.
Facebook is giving back a big chunk of yesterday's gains as the Nasdaq turns in its ugliest day in years. Thanks to Facebook's recent selloff, the price tag for the WhatsApp deal has fallen by $1.4B to $17.6B.

Yesterday: Facebook removing Messenger from core apps
 "
1371,Facebook removing messaging from core apps,"Apr. 9, 2014, 6:51 PM","

Facebook Messenger (FB +7.3%) will soon no longer be integrated within Facebook's core mobile apps. Users looking to chat with friends via Messenger will have to download the standalone app (fairly popular with mobile users, but not as popular as the core app).
Mark Zuckerberg mentioned Facebook was considering such a move last November, arguing ""there's more friction to replying to messages"" from the core app.
Also possibly a factor: Facebook's interest in growing its mindshare in an iOS/Android-dominated mobile landscape where each app is simply one icon on a home screen. The Verge has reported Facebook plans to launch a slew of new standalone apps in 2014.
In addition, it probably hasn't escaped Facebook's attention soon-to-be-acquired WhatsApp will soon have 500M+ users for its standalone messaging apps. Nonetheless, a backlash from some Facebook users accustomed to chatting via the core app is likely.
Flurry recently estimated Facebook's various services (not counting WhatsApp) has a 17% share of time spent by U.S. consumers on mobile devices.

Facebook (FB +5.5%) should soundly beat Q1 estimates when it reports on April 23, predicts Susquehanna, reiterating a Positive. Meanwhile, SunTrust (Buy) reports an exec with Facebook ad software provider Nanigans suggests Q1 ad spend was ""stronger than expected when entering the quarter,"" due to a good second half offsetting a slow start.
Also: Nanigans says it saw Facebook ad prices rise 10% Q/Q ""across the board."" With the mobile shift pressuring ad impression growth and Facebook promising not to significantly hike its news feed ad load going forward, the company is depending heavily on price improvements to drive growth.
Facebook's ad prices rose 92% Y/Y on a CPM basis in Q1, easily offsetting an 8% drop in impressions. Earnings expectations have grown following three straight blowout reports.

WhatsApp (FB +2.8%) is partnering with German carrier E-Plus to launch a €10 ($14) prepaid SIM card that provides unlimited access to its mobile messaging services (no data charges apply) to go with regular voice/SMS/data services. Even after the SIM credit is used up, WhatsApp remains available.
Notably, the SIM card is provided under WhatsApp's brand, effectively making the startup an MVNO. With an estimated 90% of German smartphone users having already installed WhatsApp, there's a large installed base to sell to.
WhatsApp, used as an SMS replacement by a huge chunk of its 465M+ global MAUs, already has deals with 50+ carriers. Many of those deals, such as one with India's Reliance, provide unlimited WhatsApp usage for a small monthly fee. Facebook proper is looking to strike deals that provide free/subsidized access to its core services; the carrier response has been mixed.
Meanwhile, a Facebook exec has told the Economic Times his company's Indian MAU base has topped 100M. That makes India (population 1.24B) Facebook's second-biggest market after the U.S. (182M MAUs). Brazil is #3 (83M), and Indonesia #4 (65M).
Globally, Facebook had 1.23B MAUs at the end of 2013. Since then, the company's mobile MAU base has surpassed 1B.

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) services account for 18% of time spent by U.S. consumers on iOS/Android devices, and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) services 17%, according to analytics firm Flurry's latest stats. Google's figure includes a 4% share for YouTube. Facebook's doesn't yet account for WhatsApp.
Pressuring Google's usage share: Web browsing activity, to which search activity is tightly linked, accounts for only 14% of all time spent, down from 20% a year earlier. In addition, half that time is claimed by Apple's Safari, which carries steep search traffic acquisition costs for Google.
Google is trying to address the browsing/app issue in part by making its search engine more useful for finding/discovering content within apps. But progress has been gradual.
Nonetheless, as noted by Flurry, eMarketer estimates Google accounted for 49% of 2013 global mobile ad spend, well above Facebook's 17.5%. Contributing factors: Google's mobile search (and search ad) hegemony, a solid mobile display ad position, and Android's dominant position in most international markets.
Flurry thinks Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has just a 1.5% usage share. It's worth noting comScore estimates Twitter's app was only used by 22.8% of U.S. smartphone users in January. 77.6% used Facebook's core app, and 27.5% Instagram. Five different Google apps were used by over 40% of users.

1378,Google reportedly showed interest in Oculus; Zuck calls its tech superior,"Mar. 26, 2014, 1:10 PM","

Google (GOOG -0.4%) appears to have ""seriously sniffed around"" Oculus VR before Facebook (FB -3.8%) closed a deal to buy the VR headset maker, Kara Swisher reports. Meanwhile, The Verge reports ""several big companies"" had made overtures to Oculus (no names are given), and that the startup's VC investors ""offered the company more money to go it alone.""
Over time, Oculus' Rift headset, which Facebook hopes will be used for many non-gaming applications, could compete against Google Glass. For now, they address different markets: Rift is much heavier/bulkier than Glass, but also provides an immersive VR/3D gaming experience.
During a CC, Mark Zuckerberg asserted the Rift is ""way ahead"" of rival products such as Sony's (SNE -0.4%) Morpheus (due in 2015), and that Oculus' talent is unmatched. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe argues Facebook's resources will help make the Rift cheaper (the dev. kit currently goes for $350).

Stacy Higginbotham remains an Oculus skeptic: While calling a demo she tried out ""immersive and neat,"" she adds it was ""nothing like real life."" Brad Stone thinks ""there's nothing social"" about headsets that ""[blot] out absolutely everything around you.""

Jim Edwards, defending the deal, calls the Rift the kind of product for which words can't describe ""how incredible the experience of wearing one is."" VC Chris Dixon, who backed Oculus, makes a similar case.
Some game developers are unhappy about the deal. As are some of the Kickstarter backers who poured $2.4M into Oculus, and only have t-shirts and dev. kits to show for it. Facebook has joined several other Internet momentum stocks in selling off in the wake of King's disappointing IPO.

Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."" writes Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, explaining why his company is spending up to $2.3B to buy a VR headset maker.
Nonetheless, Zuck suggests Oculus will initially focus on its gaming opportunity. Last week, Oculus began taking pre-orders for its second-gen developer kit - it includes an updated Rift VR headset sporting a higher-res display and a camera that allows users to reposition their heads.
Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe promises the Rift will get much more comfortable and portable over time. ""A decade or two from now, it will be nothing but sunglasses."" If/when that happens, Rift might be squaring off against Google Glass.
A weekend NYT column discussing Oculus and Sony's headsets: ""After trying an array of prototypes and development kits ... I can assure you that virtual reality works. Technology is no longer the limitation. The lingering question is what game designers, artists and filmmakers should do with it.""
The fact Facebook is mostly paying for both Oculus and WhatsApp with shares that have soared over the last 8 months, even though the company has $11B+ in cash/investments and could obtain cheap debt, hasn't gone unnoticed.

After growing 105% last year (soundly above a prior forecast of 79%) eMarketer sees global mobile ad sales rising 75% in 2014 to $31.45B.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to account for 46.8% of all that spending; that figure is slightly below 2013's 49.3%.
An ongoing challenge for Google: Web browsing accounts for only ~20% of smartphone usage, making Google's search ad hegemony less valuable on mobile than on PCs. Helping to offset: Google's AdMob unit remains a top mobile display ad player, and the company is making efforts to integrate mobile app content within search results.
eMarketer recently predicted mobile search would account for 26.7% of Google's 2014 U.S. ad revenue, up from 19.4% in 2013. Altogether, the firm sees Google's U.S. PC search revenue falling $770M this year, and its mobile search revenue growing $1.76B.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which saw its mobile ad sales rise 4x Y/Y in Q4 and make up 53% of its ad revenue, is expected to have a 21.7% mobile ad share, up from 17.5% in 2013.
Twitter's (TWTR - 75% of Q4 ad sales from mobile) shares is expected to rise to 2.6% from 2.4%. Pandora's (P - 72% of Q4 ad revenue from mobile) is seen falling to 1.7% from 2.1%, and Millennial Media's (MM - just expanded by merging with rival Jumptap) to 0.7% from 0.8%.

Facebook's (FB -2.8%) news feed video ads, delayed more than once due to user experience concerns, are 15 seconds long (on par with Instagram's video ads) and begin automatically playing without sound. Clicking/tapping on an ad leads it to expand and sound to begin.
Ad exec Brian Boland says Facebook is testing features that allow marketers to decide at what time of day an ad appears, how often it appears, and whom it reaches. Facebook is working with video ad analytics firm Ace Metrix to weed out low-quality ads.

Past reports have mentioned Facebook is looking to charge anywhere from $1M-$2.5M/day for video ads, depending on reach. At those prices, showing the company's 757M DAUs an average of even 2-3 video ads/day could yield a $1B+/year revenue opportunity.
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others are all moving aggressively to offer targeted video ad products to brand marketers, and in doing so take a bite out of a TV ad market expected to be worth $67B in the U.S. alone.
Facebook launched a video app install ad product last fall.

Though Facebook agree to pay $45 per WhatsApp MAU, Martin thinks that figure will drop to $23/MAU within a year, given WhatsApp's growth trajectory. She also notes Facebook ($140/MAU) and Twitter ($180/MAU) have much higher per-MAU valuations (ed: unlike WhatsApp, both platforms are also monetized via ads rather than subscriptions), and that WhatsApp averages 14 sessions/user in some markets.
The gains come as Mark Zuckerberg talks shop at the Mobile World Congress. Zuck trumpets Facebook's Internet.org initiative to provide free Web access in emerging markets - Facebook is looking for 3-5 mobile carrier partners, and doesn't expect the effort to be profitable for a while - and suggests WhatsApp will be Facebook's last big acquisition for some time.

Zuck also argues WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger serve different purposes - the former acts as an SMS replacement, the latter as a way to have IM-like chats with friends.
Facebook's presentation slides (.pdf) note WhatsApp's daily traffic includes 19B messages (approaching global SMS levels), 600M+ photos, and 100M+ video messages, and that these figures are all up over 100% Y/Y.

1396,Facebook buying WhatsApp,"Feb. 19, 2014, 5:06 PM","

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is acquiring mobile messaging leader WhatsApp for a whopping $16B in cash and stock.
WhatsApp, long seen as an indirect threat to Facebook's mobile engagement rates, had 430M monthly active users as of last month. Facebook, by comparison, ended Q4 with 1.23B MAUs and 945M mobile MAUs.

FB -3.7% AH.

Update: Facebook states in the PR the deal will also include $3B worth of restricted stock units that vest over four years, leading to a total potential payout of $19B.

1397,"Twitter rebounds, Facebook makes new highs. Pivotal contrasts the two.","Feb. 7, 2014, 2:40 PM","

Down 24% yesterday due to the disappointing engagement/user growth metrics provided in its Q4 report, Twitter (TWTR +8.9%) is recouping a portion of its losses today. With 32.7M shares shorted as of Jan. 15, it's likely many shorts are taking profits.
Meanwhile, Facebook (FB +2.9%) is again surging to new highs even as LinkedIn sells off due to weak guidance. Shares are up 20% since the company posted a big Q4 beat.
Though reiterating a Sell on Twitter, Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser suggests Twitter is misunderstood by those making direct Facebook comparisons (previous), and that the former is to the latter as radio is to TV.
Twitter is ""a marketing vehicle capable of satisfying different kinds of marketing goals,"" writes Wieser. Whereas Facebook provides a better environment for marketers to form relationships with consumers and engage in ""immersive brand-building,"" Twitter provides immediacy, a greater proportion of out-of-home mobile activity, and ""a greater capacity for in-your-face messaging.""
He still considers Twitter overvalued, but believes its Q4 numbers show it's proving quite successful at gaining traction with a variety of marketers.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is down 2.3% AH, and LinkedIn (LNKD) is down 1.6%, after Twitter and Pandora provided disappointing Q4 reports. In addition, Twitter shareholder GSV Capital (NASDAQ:GSVC) is down 6.7%.
Richly-valued Twitter beat Q4 estimates and provided above-consensus revenue guidance. But it also reported a 7% Q/Q drop in Timeline views and slowing monthly active user growth. Pandora beat Q4 EPS estimates, but only reported in-line revenue and issued below-consensus guidance.

1399,"Facebook launches reader app, will allow anonymous accounts","Jan. 30, 2014, 11:57 AM","

With its shares soaring above $60 following a big Q4 beat, Facebook (FB +16%) has announced it's launching Paper, its rumored mobile reader app.
Like Flipboard (the market's leader), LinkedIn's Pulse, and Google Currents, Paper allows users to browse articles (split up into topics) and social media updates via horizontal swiping, and features an image-heavy UI. But it (naturally) places a much bigger emphasis on Facebook browsing, and also offers advanced tools for uploading content.

The Verge: ""[Paper is] much more than just a news-reading app — it's a complete reimagining of Facebook itself. Once you've used it, you may never want to open the standard Facebook app again.""
Product design lead Mike Matas ambitiously hopes the app, part of a broader push by Facebook to launch new standalone apps to grow its mobile engagement, will result in better content being uploaded. ""As you start changing the way you’re displaying this content, we hope that it will change the way people think about posting content.""
Meanwhile a BloombergBusinessweek cover story about Facebook's 10th anniversary mentions the company will (like Twitter and Instagram) soon allow users of certain apps to log in anonymously.
Such a move comes amid concerns Facebook's insistence on real names, along with a focus on private sharing with friends/family, has led to waning interest among teens and certain other demographics.

Instagram's user base has doubled over the last year, says COO David Ebersman on Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Q4 CC. With the mobile photo-sharing service having possessed 90M MAUs a year ago, that suggests Instagram might now have 180M. Instagram passed 150M MAUs in September.Mark Zuckerberg confirmed Facebook is interested in developing more standalone mobile apps. ""[We will] build a handful of great new experiences that are separate from what you think of as Facebook today."" That backs up a report from The Verge stating Facebook plans to launch several new apps in 2014, as it tries to maintain mindshare in an environment where each app is one of many icons on a smartphone home screen.Zuck also stated Facebook Messenger (one of its standalone apps) has seen 70% growth over the last 3 months, and claims its efforts to emphasize ""high-quality"" news content stem from the realization that content receiving a large number of ""likes"" isn't necessarily the content users want to see.Though responsible for less than 1/6 of Facebook's MAUs, North America still accounted for 47% of revenue in Q4. While Facebook's North American ARPU is at $6.03, its ARPUs for Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world are still only at $2.61, $0.95, and $0.84, respectively.CC live blogs: I, IIQ4 results, details, slides "

Facebook's (FB -1.5%) on-again/off-again efforts to launch a mobile display ad network are back on: The social networking giant says it has started a new test in which targeted Facebook ads will be shown within 3rd-party apps.Though Facebook has done similar tests before, the company says this one is ""more like a mobile ad network"" in that it's working directly with publishers and advertisers, rater than a 3rd-party ad-serving platform.Facebook's move is aimed at Google's (GOOG -0.2%) AdMob unit, the unquestioned leader in the mobile display ad space, and also Twitter's (TWTR -0.2%) recently-acquired MoPub mobile ad network/exchange unit. Millennial Media (MM -0.3%) and Apple's iAd unit also compete in this market.Twitter reportedly plans to launch a mobile ad network that leverages both MoPub and Twitter's user data.Helping Facebook's cause: The company has mountains of user data that it can rely on to deliver targeted ads, and its mobile ad business already works with thousands of app developers (courtesy of its app install ads).In spite of AdMob, the growing share of Web usage claimed by mobile apps remains a threat to Google's massive share of online ad spend, given the latter is heavily tied to search activity done via Web browsers.

Much like Twitter's (TWTR +0.9%) popular ""Trends"" feature, Facebook's offering allows users to scan publicly-shared content related to topics being widely discussed at a given point in time. One notable difference: Facebook also provides contextual info explaining why a topic is trending.
""Trending"" is the latest in a string of new features aimed at getting Facebook users to share more content publicly; others include hashtags and embedded posts. It could also enable an ad product similar to Twitter's Promoted Trends.
Though Facebook has had plenty of success getting businesses and celebrities to post public content, getting its broader user base to share content publicly the way that Twitter users frequently do is proving an uphill battle.

A source tells re/code Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is prepping a news reader app called Paper, and could launch it this month.
The initiative, known as Project Reader, is said to be a multi-year effort from the team responsible for Facebook's news feed. The source isn't certain whether Paper will be a standalone mobile app or ""a Web experience suited to mobile devices.""
Facebook's reader (assuming it launches) will enter a crowded news reader landscape in which Flipboard (raised funding last year at a reported $800M valuation) is the top dog. Google has an offering in this space (Currents), as does LinkedIn (Pulse).
As highlighted by recent acquisitions and product changes, Facebook is intent on developing into a hub its users rely on for discovering and sharing important news. But getting them to do so through the standard news feed require changing ingrained behavior patterns; no such requirement exists for a separate reader app.
Separately, Facebook has formed a partnership with Russian search giant Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) to include its publicly-shared data withing Yandex's search results. The deal, similar to one Facebook has with Bing, is part of an effort to gain ground against Vkontakte (VK for short), which dominates the Russian social networking scene.

But (as noted in a December AllThingsD report) a disconnect currently exists between Facebook's goal and actual user activity. ""Low-quality"" viral content posted on Facebook often receives far more clicks and comments than ""high-quality"" news content.

Sandler, who sang Google's praises yesterday, says he wouldn't be surprised if Facebook's ad revenue growth (+66% Y/Y in Q3) re-accelerated in Q4 thanks to improving monetization and still-rising engagement.
Android app monitoring tool developer Little Eye Labs has confirmed its expected acquisition by Facebook. A source tells TechCrunch the startup, which bolsters Facebook's efforts to become the top platform for consumer mobile/Web app development, was acquired for $10M-$15M.
During a recent interview, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) game partnership director Sean Ryan asserts Facebook is still seeing growing PC gaming activity, in spite of the mobile shift. That's a positive for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), provided the company can stabilize its share. Ryan also claims the development of cross-platform games (e.g. Zynga Poker, Candy Crush Saga) yields higher engagement on both mobile and PCs.
PC gaming still remains easier for Facebook to monetize, since the company (rather than Apple or Google) gets a 30% cut on in-app purchases. On mobile, Facebook is focused on monetizing gaming via its app install ads.

SunTrust's Robert Peck has hiked his Facebook (FB +3.4%) PT to $65 from $55 (established in September), citing optimism about a number of ad and engagement  trends.
Peck thinks concerns about slowing news feed ad load growth (triggered by Q3 CC remarks) are ""overdone"" in light of improving ad targeting and pricing. He also considers teen usage concerns overblown, given Facebook has evolved from being a ""cool app"" to a social utility.
Peck is enthusiastic about Facebook's Instagram and video ad ramps (he thinks they could add ~$300M in 2014 revenue), and (citing 3rd-party data) believes Facebook and other social apps saw healthy usage trends in Q4.
Meanwhile, the WSJ has provided a behind-the-scenes look at how Mark Zuckerberg learned to stop worrying and love ad monetization, as his company contended with a rocky 2012 IPO and the mobile shift.
""If you brought up revenue in an argument with Zuck, you would lose automatically,"" says one former employee. But Zuckerberg gradually embraced news feed ads and non-social ads (i.e. ads not tied to ""likes"" and other social signals), and eventually concluded ""some decline in usage would be an acceptable trade-off for higher ad sales,"" provided the drop was more than offset by other improvements.
Zuck: ""It's not like I just decided to get more involved in ads ... I needed to because basically the ad product had to be more integrated.""

Looking at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and assuming it can garner 5% of this action, Sena says 17% of his team's 2016 $6B revenue estimate would consist of video.

That compares with 22% for LinkedIn (LNKD - up from 20%), 21% for Pinterest (up from 15%), 18% for Twitter (TWTR - up from 16%), and 17% for Facebook-owned Instagram (up from 13%).
Facebook's success at reeling in older users has helped it continue growing: 45% of respondents age 65 or older said they use Facebook, up from 35% a year ago. 63% of users say they check in daily, and 22% weekly.
Unsurprisingly, Twitter and Instagram's user bases skew young: 31% and 37% of respondents in the age 18-29 demographic respectively use Twitter and Instagram, compared with 9% and 6% in the 50-64 demographic. 46% of Twitter users say they check in daily, a level notably below Facebook's 63% and Instagram's 57%.
A mere 13% of LinkedIn users claim to check in daily, evidence the company's efforts to boost engagement need more work. But the platform is used by 38% of respondents making over $75K, and 27% of all employed respondents. LinkedIn's recruiting and ad clients will be happy to know that.

Mostly they feel embarrassed even to be associated with it ... Parents have worked out how to use the site ... In response, the young are moving on to cooler things."" Miller adds U.K. teens are reallocating their social media time to Twitter, (Facebook-owned) Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat, with none of those services fully replacing Facebook on their own. A recent Piper survey of U.S. teen social media use turned up similar findings. Worries about Facebook's teen engagement have been easy to find since the company disclosed on its Q3 CC it saw a Q/Q drop in U.S. teen daily active users. Sheryl Sandberg later insisted overall U.S. teen Facebook usage remains stable. The bigger question for Facebook: Is softening engagement among teens in certain markets simply the result of teen-specific issues (for example, not wanting to engage with a social network one's parents and other older relatives are on), or a leading indicator of broader issues (e.g. boredom, privacy concerns) that could affect engagement among other demographic groups?

Cantor's Youssef Squali believes Facebook's (FB +4.5%) ad load (the proportion of news feed content consisting of ads) has doubled in Q4 to 10%. Though Facebook typically sees its ad load rise in Q4 Squali thinks there's an improvement in ad quality this time around, with more sales to major brands and ""a greater mix of higher-priced click-to-play video ads.""
The remarks come only two months after Facebook made investors nervous by stating it won't significantly increase its news feed ad load going forward, and will focus on improving quality.
In addition to Squali's note, shares could also be getting a lift from the fact Facebook's 70M-share, $3.85B stock offering was priced at only a modest discount to where shares traded before the offering was first announced.
Meanwhile, Facebook has struck a deal with T-Mobile USA (TMUS +0.9%) to offer free access to Facebook and Facebook Messenger to users of the #4 U.S. carrier's GoSmart prepaid services, whether or not they have data plans.
Facebook has already reached similar deals with many international carriers, in an effort to grow its user base and mobile engagement in markets where many Internet users are mobile-only.

Instagram Direct, a new service being launched at the mobile photo-sharing platform's NYC event (previous), allows Instagram (FB +3.9%) users to privately send photos and videos to up to 15 users. The photos can be accessed via Instagram's main feed, and are complemented by a group chat feature.

Om Malik previously reported Instagram was prepping a private messaging service. Though much attention is being given to how Direct compares to Snapchat, which Facebook reportedly tried to buy for $3B+, it's arguably more a response to the rise of mobile messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Kik, Line, and Viber, particularly in international markets.
Those messaging platforms are viewed as a threat to Facebook's mobile engagement rates, particularly as they develop app/services ecosystems around them. WhatsApp alone has 350M+ monthly active users (MAUs); Instagram reached 150M in September, and Facebook proper is at 1.19B.
Direct is also arguably a response to Twitter (TWTR -1.3%), which recently updated its apps to support private photo-sharing, and to place greater emphasis on private messaging in general. Twitter also recently began showing image previews in its Timelines.
Instagram hasn't announced a printing service, as was expected by many.

""The gap between ... two Facebooks (NASDAQ:FB) — the one its managers want to see, and the one its users like using today — is starting to become visible,"" writes AllThingsD's Mike Isaac in a report examining the social networking giant's efforts to evolve into a news/information hub.
But while Mark Zuckerberg wants his company to be ""the best personalized newspaper in the world,"" its users still largely see it as a place to keep in touch with friends/family and ""share a funny, viral story or LOLcat picture."" Viral, ""low-quality"" content often receives far more clicks than ""high-quality"" news pieces.
This disconnect has reportedly led Facebook to hold off on rolling out its media-heavy news feed overhaul (announced in March) to most users, and for engagement to stall among those users who have received the update.
An update amounting to ""a less drastic change"" is now reportedly being prepped. Ahead of that move, and in spite of the click rate data, Facebook has updated its news feed algorithm to show more ""high-quality"" stories.
Meanwhile, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), while still having a far smaller active user base, has evolved into a news hub for many of its users, and is trying to make the most of this status.
Isaac's report arguably drives home the challenges Facebook contends with as it tries to keep users (inc. younger ones) tiring of its traditional fare engaged, and without alienating the hundreds of millions of users content with the status quo.

Though centered around basic messaging services, the apps have added support for photo/video-sharing, 3rd-party games, and even payments, and in doing so represent a challenge to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter's engagement rates.

Some think Instagram, which just began monetizing its service via ads, could make hundreds of millions annually simply by adding a print button to its apps, and taking a cut on orders placed through it.

AdAge reports Facebook is not-so-subtly telling marketers they won't be able to reach users as effectively going forward via posts published on brand pages (and then distributed for free onto the news feeds of users who ""liked"" the page), as the company attempts to ""make sure people have a meaningful experience on the site.""
While advertisers might view Facebook's efforts as an attempt to sell more ads, they do come amid worries certain users (particularly younger ones) are cutting their Facebook usage as a result of finding their news feeds filled with uninteresting material. AdAge's report comes shortly after Facebook tweaked its news feed algorithm to display more ""relevant"" news stories.
During a Credit Suisse conference talk (transcript), infrastructure chief Jason Taylor shined a light on the huge investments that go into optimizing the performance, cost structure, and power efficiency of Facebook's data centers.

The Business Standard reports Facebook (FB -0.6%) is in talks to buy Little Eye Labs, an Indian startup that has developed tools to monitor/analyze Android app performance, and troubleshoot problems. Sources state a deal is expected to be announced over the next few weeks.

Private and group photo messaging services would represent a challenge to fast-growing Snapchat, widely reported to have snubbed Facebook's M&A overtures. And Instagram, with 150M+ mobile MAUs, high engagement levels, and a solid cachet with younger social media users, is arguably a better platform for launching the features than Facebook proper.
But as the many mobile photo apps that have failed to slow down Instagram (in spite of adding filter support) can attest, it takes more than adding comparable features to steal a popular social networking/messaging platform's thunder. Last year, Facebook launched a Snapchat-like app called Poke, but it failed to gain much traction.

The comments are meant to calm growing worries Facebook's popularity is waning among younger U.S. users, and that this trend could have broader long-term implications for Facebook usage. Those fears have been amplified by Facebook's admission it saw a Q/Q drop in U.S. teen DAUs in Q3, and reports it made a rejected $3B+ bid for Snapchat.
Sandberg insists Facebook's news feed ad business can keep growing thanks to improved ad quality and targeting - new tools such as Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences are expected to help - even as Facebook refrains from any further major increases in news feed ad load.

Monster, meanwhile, is called a play on job recovery, strategic initiatives, and buybacks.

 ""Someone once told me that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would be a great service if you un-friended 90% of your friends,"" writes Tech.pinions' Ben Bajarin, highlighting what he views as a core problem with the social networking colossus. While Facebook users may initially find ""the joy of discovery and connecting"" with people they know 'a very sticky experience,"" the service eventually ""becomes more about maintaining than connecting,"" and feeds filled with far more ""noise"" than interesting material. Meanwhile, limiting one's friends list to close/interesting contacts would drastically limit the amount of fresh material showing up. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), as Bajarin notes, has a very different problem. New users can have a much harder time finding contacts who are active users (that might be contributing to Twitter's heavy churn). But those who hang around often find plenty of compelling material delivered by non-contacts. Moreover, while Facebook is encroaching on Twitter's turf by encouraging more posting of public material - outside of celebrities and businesses, success has been moderate thus far - Twitter is trying to appeal to Facebook users by allowing images, videos, and cards to appear within timelines. Facebook's problem is of particular relevance following a Q3 in which North American MAUs rose by only 1M Q/Q, and U.S. teen DAUs declined; the latter revelation follows surveys and anecdotal reports pointing to declining popularity with U.S. teens, who have acted as trendsetters for many Web services (including Facebook, back in its college-only days).

Not spooked by ad trends, BMO downgrades Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from Buy to Hold anyway due to the lack of visibility surrounding the opportunity in Social TV advertising. For the stock to move higher, the Social TV story is needed ... the rest is priced in.

Noting decelerating user growth, steady newsfeed ad load, and several data points suggesting engagement in developed markets isn't growing that much, Bernstein suggests revenue growth must increasingly come from rising price-per-ad. ""We don’t think there is enough visibility into the demand for Facebook ads to make a high conviction call on the stock.""

Facebook also says it expects its Payments revenue to decline (+24% Y/Y in Q3) in Q4. It's worth noting here Facebook recorded four months of Payments revenue in Q4 2012.

Better late than never? BTIG's Richard Greenfield, who upgraded Facebook (FB +0.2%) to Neutral in July following its blowout Q2 numbers, has upgraded shares to Buy in advance of this afternoon's Q3 report.
Greenfield, who has frequently criticized the quality of Facebook ads: ""We notably underestimated Facebook’s stickiness as a consumer utility for messaging and photosharing, not to mention the power of Facebook as a ""cure for boredom,"" both in-home and on-the-go. BTIG's survey data found even users who say they're dissatisfied with Facebook ""continue to use it on a daily basis.""
He's also optimistic about the potential of Instagram to offer high-quality brand ads backed by strong user feedback. Om Malik recently made a similar argument: he sees native ad formats such as Instagram's yielding much better engagement than standard display ads (for which click rates have been steadily dropping), and potentially ""[openng] up a whole new era of Madison Avenue creativity.""
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) doesn't want to get left out: the company just began allowing previews of images and Vine videos to directly appear in timeline feeds. That, in turn, could open the door to visual brand ads.
Facebook's sponsored news feed posts and Twitter's Promoted Tweet, Trend, and Account products also qualify as native ad products.

The WSJ's Everlyn Rusli reports Mark Zuckerberg (NASDAQ:FB) approached Snapchat about acquiring the startup for $1B+, but was turned down.
Much like the Instagram deal, buying Snapchat would give Facebook control of a mobile picture-sharing platform that's seeing massive growth (350M+ Snapchat photos are now shared daily), and which is evolving into a social networking platform that could affect Facebook's engagement levels. Snapchat would also strengthen Facebook's efforts to keep teen users engaged amid concerns its popularity with the demographic is slipping.

Piper's latest survey of U.S. teen social media use found only 23% named Facebook their most important social media site, down from 33% in spring and 42% a year ago. On the other hand, Instagram rose to 23% from 17% and 12%. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) came in at 26% vs. prior levels of 30% and 27%.

""I do worry a little bit that we're beginning to hear things that are reminiscent of the 1999-2000 period—the number of hits, the number of eyeballs,"" says UBS' Art Cashin, suggesting a new tech bubble is afoot.
Cashin doesn't claim all tech names are taking part - many large-caps still go for less than 15x trailing EPS and 3x sales - just some of those with strong cloud and/or mobile exposure. ""We're beginning to see a case of old tech/new tech.""
Though using P/Es to value growth-stage tech firms can be tricky, given how near-term earnings are often depressed by big investments, a look at price/sales multiples makes it clear valuations for many high-growth names have soared.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and YELP now respectively trade at 13.4x, 13.1x, 10.9x, and 14.8x 2014E sales. The story is similar for some enterprise-focused names: Workday (NYSE:WDAY) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) go for 20.7x and 17.3x FY15E (ends Jan.

Price/billings ratios for enterprise firms that depend heavily on cloud subscriptions are a bit lower than price/sales ratios, but are still often in the double-digit range.

Facebook's (FB +3.8%) FBX exchange (shows targeted ads on Facebook sites based on non-Facebook activity) will now allow advertisers using DoubleClick's (GOOG +13.9%) Bid Manager ad-buying platform to purchase ad inventory.
As AllThingsD's Peter Kafka observes, the deal is a big one, given FBX's growth and DoubleClick's huge display ad market presence; Bid Manager already supports dozens of online ad exchanges.
Whereas Facebook had granted FBX access to ad tech platforms from AOL, Adobe, and many others, Bid Manager was a notable exception, reportedly due to concerns Google would gain access to valuable pricing/inventory data it could use to better compete against FBX.
Kafka: ""Either Google has made concessions to Facebook to get access to Facebook’s inventory, or Facebook has decided that working with its biggest competitor is better than shutting it out. Or both.""
FBX and DoubleClick's Ad Exchange compete in a fast-growing market for real-time (programmatic) ad bidding. AOL, Yahoo, and newly-public Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL) also take part.

Bellini says Goldman's online ad contacts ""again reported FB's ad products deliver the best performance outside of search,"" and the performance of the FBX exchange (display ads based on non-Facebook activity) especially stood out. A majority of contacts also reported major growth in mobile ad spend.
Bellini's PC ad forecast is below consensus ($890M vs. $914M), but her Payments forecast is above ($220M vs. $209M). Ad prices are expected to grow 8% Y/Y, and impressions 38%.

Evercore's Ken Sena has raised his Facebook (FB +2.5%) PT to $60 from $45, and thinks Instagram (about to launch its first ads) could generate $340M in 2014 revenue (~3% of Facebook's total sales).
Sena also sees Facebook's efforts to deliver targeted ads using data about non-Facebook activity yielding ""additional pricing strength"" and creating offline commerce opportunities, and calls pricing checks ""exceptionally strong.""
He observes Facebook's 2012 U.S. ARPU was only $13 - its 2013 figure will doubtlessly be higher - less than Yahoo's $18 and the New York Times' $20, and far below Gannett's $48 and Google's $80.
Separately, Facebook has updated its Custom Audiences platform, which thus far focused on enabling targeted ads based on offline activity, to allow marketers to deliver news feed ads based on Web site/app activity.
Facebook asserts the new ads are complementary to those enabled by its FBX Exchange (also deliver retargeted ads). It's pitching the former to ""businesses that don’t typically work with third parties,"" and the latter to larger firms.

With 150M+ active users (up 5x since the Facebook deal was announced and closing in on Twitter's reported ~240M), Instagram has evolved into a major social network in its own right.
Interestingly, though Instagram's parent company prides itself on an algorithm-heavy approach to determining what content a user should see, Systrom suggests Instagram will lean more on human judgment and community ""signals,"" albeit while granting ""there's no one person that can figure out what you should be looking at.""
Fine-tuning Instagram for foreign audiences is also a priority, as is getting the platform integrated with more 3rd-party apps/services through its Open Platform API.
Systrom's remarks come shortly after Instagram announced it will begin showing brand ads to U.S. users in the coming months. The company just introduced an app update that prevents users from disabling video autoplay on Wi-Fi, a move that may have been made with video ads in mind.
Adrian Salamunovic, co-founder of an online printing startup, argues Instagram could make hundreds of millions annually by adding a print button to its apps that provides access to printing services.

Facebook's login share surged from 2010-2012, partly at Google's expense, and peaked in Q3 of last year at 54%. Google, which bottomed at 33% that quarter, has made up some ground since then. The company's efforts to promote Google+ sign-ins are a key reason.

The hiring comes two months after North American ad sales chief and 7-year Facebook vet Tom Arrix left, and a day after Flurry announced it has hired top Facebook ad strategy exec Grady Burnett to be its COO.
North America accounted for 47% of Facebook's Q2 revenue ($848M out of $1.81B).
News of the hiring comes as Facebook expands Graph Search's reach to include status updates, comments, and photo captions, and check-in info shared with a particular user. Until now, Graph Search (made available this summer to all U.S. users) was focused on profile data and user ""likes.""
If users take a liking to Graph Search, it could provide a large boost to Facebook's search ad revenue, particularly given the ad targeting possibilities for business/product-related searches. But it remains to be seen how interested users will be in performing the kind of complex, multi-part queries Graph Search enables.

1478,Senior Facebook ad exec leaves for Flurry; company sharing TV data,"Sep. 30, 2013, 2:05 PM","

Grady Burnett, Facebook's (FB -0.9%) VP of Global Marketing Solutions for the last 4+ years, has left the company to become the COO of hot mobile ad-serving/analytics startup Flurry. Burnett helped craft Facebook's ad strategy, and was an exec at Google's DoubleClick unit before joining the social networking kingpin. (PR)
Facebook has already seen plenty of executive departures this year, including several involving ad execs. EMEA director Christian Hernandez and North American sales chief Tom Arrix left in July, and ad product chief Gokul Rajaram left in June.
Separately, Facebook says it will start providing NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox (along with a few smaller partners) weekly reports of Facebook commentary about their shows, in an effort to get the broadcasters to increase their engagement. The move follows the launch of new APIs meant to give media companies a quick birds-eye view of trending topics and public content.

Nine months after ending a test for a mobile ad network that would deliver display ads on 3rd-party sites/apps based on a user's Facebook (FB +0.9%) activity, Facebook has begun new tests.
The move comes shortly after Twitter bought mobile ad network MoPub for a reported $350M. If Facebook does a full launch, its network will put it into competition with Google's AdMob (the market leader), Apple's iAd, and Millennial Media (MM -1.7%), which is merging with rival Jumptap.
Separately, Facebook ad sales chief Carolyn Everson says Facebook is making further efforts to simplify its mobile ad offerings (previous), and needs to do more work to improve ad measurement. The purchase of Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving platform helps on that front; so might a reportedly pending Nielsen deal.
Also: Facebook has updated its news feed ad-placement algorithm to take into account marketer feedback on whom they'd like to target, and user feedback on what ads are relevant (or not).
Facebook's mobile ad sales, for now stemming only from the company's own site and apps, rose 75% Q/Q in Q2 to $656M, and made up 41% of total revenue.

Goldman's Heather Bellini has raised her Facebook PT to $58 from $52.

Jefferies' Brian Pitz has raised his Facebook PT all the way to $60 from $37, while arguing there's still plenty of room for Facebook to grow its adjusted op. margin from a current 44%.
Wunderlich's Blake T. Harper has raised his LinkedIn PT to $280 from $250 (matching Evercore's recent move). He predicts LinkedIn's Talent Solutions (jobs) business will beat expectations again in Q3, thanks to strong job listings growth, price hikes, and growing engagement.
Talent Solutions made up 56% of LinkedIn's Q2 revenue, and saw 69% Y/Y sales growth.

Facebook (FB +4.7%), Twitter, and the New York Times are among the sites that will reportedly be made accessible.
In addition, the government plans to allow foreign carriers to bid for licenses to provide Internet services in the free-trade zone. State-owned carriers China Mobile (CHL -0.8%), China Telecom (CHA -1.8%), and China Unicom (CHU -2.8%) have all reportedly been informed foreign companies will be able to compete with them in the area.

As previously reported, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) mobile payments autofill solution won't handle payment-processing on its own, but will simply autofill billing info for 3rd-party sites/apps with the help of data already provided to Facebook (via Facebook Payments, should a user have relied on it). Payment processors take over from there.
PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the processors acting as a launch partner. So are two of its rivals, Braintree and Stripe. The WSJ just reported PayPal is close to buying the former.
To the extent the service makes it easier for mobile users to pay through a PayPal rival, it could still serve as an indirect threat to the online payments giant. That, in turn, arguably bolsters the case for acquiring a company such as Braintree.
For now at least, Facebook's main goal with the product appears to be the gathering of additional purchase data (previous), which it could later use to deliver targeted ads.

A former Google exec, Badros held a number of positions during his 4 years at Facebook; most recently, he was in charge of the company's search product efforts. His departure comes shortly after Facebook launched Graph Search.
A new Facebook research team is using an artificial intelligence technique known as deep learning to better decipher the meaning and importance (or lack thereof) of news feed content, and in doing so predict user actions and determine what content should go to the top of a news feed.
A Facebook researcher suggests deep learning could also be used to help users organize content and making sharing/upload decisions. Google, aided by Ray Kurzweil, is looking to apply deep learning to search.
Facebook's news feed algorithm (depends on human judgment rather than AI) already takes into account nearly 100K factors to decide where content is placed within a news feed.
Facebook's iOS apps have been given an iOS 7-friendly overhaul (video). The biggest changes: the traditional sidebar has been replaced by buttons at the bottom of the display, and (for iOS 7 users) a bar at the top of the app changes as a user scrolls. Facebook says it did plenty of secret user testing with its older apps before making the changes.

Though Twitter CEO Dick Costolo proclaimed earlier this year he expected the microblogging giant to have 400M monthly active users (MAUs) by the end of 2013 after hitting 200M in Dec. '12, sources tell AllThingsD Twitter currently has ~240M MAUs.
That implies a 2013 growth rate of less than 4.5M MAUs/month, and suggests Twitter will end the year with ~260M, far below Costolo's target. For reference, Facebook (FB -0.9%) closed Q2 with 1.15B total MAUs (+3.6% Q/Q and +21% Y/Y) and 819M mobile MAUs. Om Malik previously reported Twitter is falling short of Costolo's target, but didn't give a specific number.
Twitter employees tell AllThingsD their company ""has a basic problem with churn — lots of people sample the service, and then stop using it."" Twitter is trying to address the problem in part by adding Facebook-like features (such as a conversations view) it hopes will make the service less intimidating to new users. Ironically, this is happening while Facebook tries to become more like Twitter.
Twitter shareholders GSV Capital (GSVC +14.5%) and the Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC +6.5%) remain up sharply. However, Chinese microblogging leader Sina (SINA -2.4%) has given up yesterday's AH gains.

Zuck also insisted Facebook isn't giving up on its oft-criticized Home Android UI. Home will soon integrate content from Instagram and 3rd-party social networks (Twitter?), and will also begin to be promoted via Facebook's site/apps. Facebook has been gradually addressing user complaints about Home, but it still only has a rating of 2.5/5 stars on Google Play. A lot of time was spent talking up Facebook's efforts to grow its developer ecosystem, and in doing so become a platform that 3rd-party sites/apps rely on for much more than basic social sharing. The app development/management tools Facebook obtained by acquiring startup Parse are central to those efforts.  Parse, used by 100K+ apps, rolled out a big update last week that included new analytics tools and cloud services modules.

1508,Instagram acquires video app startup; Facebook overhauls Gifts,"Aug. 23, 2013, 7:00 PM","

Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) has bought Luma, developer of a video capture//sharing app that didn't get much traction in a crowded field in spite of having some unique image-stabilization and video-filter features.
Luma's app is being shut down, and its team is joining Instagram, whose recently-launched video-upload features (they include a stabilization tool) are proving popular, but also continue to face intense competition from Twitter's Vine.
Though it's taking its time in monetizing Instagram, Facebook appears intent on providing the photo-sharing service with more R&D resources. The company recently made Peter Deng, a product manager who helped develop Facebook's Chat, Groups, and Messenger apps, Instagram's Director of Product.
Separately, Facebook's Gifts e-commerce product is removing support for physical gift purchases. Gifts will now only offer gift cards from merchant partners, and a general-purpose Facebook Gift Card that can be used with multiple merchants. As it is, gift cards made up 80% of the sales recorded by Gifts, which has only seen modest success thus far.

1512,"Zynga lower, Facebook slightly up after Janney starts coverage","Aug. 20, 2013, 10:17 AM","

Janney's Tony Wilbe and Murali Sankar have started coverage of Facebook (FB +0.4%) with a Buy and $50 PT, and Zynga (ZNGA -2.8%) with a Sell and $2.50 PT. Zynga is selling off; Facebook opened higher, but has since pared its gains.
In addition to making the usual comments about Facebook's mobile potential, the analysts argue Facebook has ""a unique opportunity to gain [ad] share by working with TV networks,"" in light of research indicating U.S. consumers are increasingly using smart devices during ad breaks rather than fast-forwarding ads.
They also argue Facebook is ""ideally positioned to break historical barriers to entry"" in the payments market (previous) on account of its 1M ad buyers, 1.1B users, and widespread adoption of Facebook Connect by third-party sites/apps.
But with regards to Zynga, Wilbe and Sankar assert the company is seeing a ""vicious cycle"" of declining game activity and friend-to-friend promotional work. Tough competition and a changing relationship with Facebook are also raised as concerns.
Oddly enough, the analysts also suggest next-gen console launches are a threat to both Zynga and Facebook's gaming-related revenue, and that ""a substantial portion"" of Zynga's 1.9M unique payers are hard-core gamers. The FarmVille and Call of Duty user bases aren't historically known for having huge overlap.

Analyst Ken Sena is raising his PT to $45 from $34. He argues the fruits of Facebook's (FB +1.5%) recent ad improvements only began around the middle of Q2, and stand to have a bigger impact on upcoming results.
Among the improvements: Facebook's efforts to simplify ad formats, to build custom ad audiences with the help of non-Facebook data, to enable larger news feed ads, to bring the FBX display ad exchange to mobile, and to integrate the Atlas ad server/tracking platform (recently acquired from Microsoft).
Sena is raising his Q3 and 2014 revenue estimates soundly above consensus, and now expects Facebook to post a 29% 5-year ad revenue CAGR (up from a prior 20%).

1514,Facebook higher following bullish analyst notes,"Aug. 16, 2013, 2:36 PM","

After giving back a sliver of its giant post-earnings gains in recent days, Facebook (FB +2.4%) is rallying with the help of upbeat notes from Raymond James and Topeka.
RJ's Aaron Kessler (Strong Buy) says talks with marketing developers indicate ""the outlook for Facebook advertising demand remains positive"" thanks to the company's mobile positioning, growing direct advertiser support, international sales, and ""increasing traction"" with consumer goods/automotive advertisers. Ad demand is said to be flat Q/Q due to seasonality.
Topeka's Victor Anthony (Buy, PT raised to $47 from $40) says checks point to rising news feed ad clicks and prices in Q3 relative to Q2, even as ad loads stay flat. He also thinks Instagram and video ads (not factored into his estimates) could add $3-$5/share in value.
Also: Facebook is replacing two credit facilities worth a combined $6.5B with a new 5-year facility worth the same amount, and sporting an interest rate of LIBOR + 1%. With the company holding $10.3B in cash/investments at the end of Q2 and only $1.5B in debt, it has no need to tap the facility unless it plots a huge acquisition.

1515,eBay losses pared following TechCrunch report on Facebook's plans,"Aug. 15, 2013, 5:45 PM","

Down as much as 4.7% earlier today, eBay (EBAY -2%) finished with losses only a little worse than the Nasdaq's after TechCrunch provided its own report about Facebook's (FB -0.3%) mobile payments product.
Like AllThingsD, TechCrunch reports Facebook's product won't offer payment-processing for now, but will rather focus on auto-filling billing info using data already provided to Facebook (the new Google Wallet functions in a similar manner).
But while AllThingsD argued Facebook's service amounts to a PayPal rival, TechCrunch argues this isn't the case, and that Facebook's primary goal is to collect data about user buying activity that could be used to improve ad sales/targeting. Facebook has already made some moves in this direction.
The truth may be in between. Though a lack of payment-processing (for now) prevents Facebook's offering from being a soup-to-nuts PayPal alternative, a product that allows billing info to be quickly auto-filled could still lead to more mobile transactions being processed by PayPal rivals. That is, provided Facebook is more successful here than Google Checkout/Wallet.
 "
1516,Facebook working on PayPal rival; eBay shares slide,"Aug. 15, 2013, 9:45 AM","

Facebook (FB +0.4%) confirms to AllThingsD it's testing an online payments product. A launch is expected in the next month or so.
Sources state the product, set to compete against 800-lb. gorilla PayPal (EBAY -2.4%), will ""allow online shoppers to make purchases on mobile apps using their Facebook login information,"" and (like PayPal) will allow them to avoid having to constantly re-enter their billing info.
However, for now, the test is focused on simply ""creating a better mobile checkout experience,"" and doesn't tie in payment-processing (as PayPal does).
Facebook already handles payments for in-app game purchases and its Gifts product (among other things), and the enormous reach of its social sharing tools could allow it to quickly reel in many 3rd-party apps and (if it chooses to expand further) Web sites.
But PayPal has stared down competition from Internet giants before, and the network effects stemming from its 132M active users and many thousands of merchant partners make it a tough company to seriously disrupt. PayPal expects to handle $20B in mobile transactions this year, up from $14B last year.

Facebook says it will support MT's apps ""for the time being,"" but its clear goal is to integrate the startup's underlying technology into various Facebook apps.

Google and Apple, needless to say, are making their own big investments in voice recognition and (in Google's case) machine translation.
Facebook discloses its Indian monthly active users rose another 5% in Q2 to 82M. In its Q2 earnings slides, Facebook noted 39M of the 45M MAUs it added in Q2 came from Asia or the Rest of World segment. Only 6M came from the higher-ARPU North America and Europe segments.

OpenTable (OPEN +3.9%) and Rovi (ROVI +1.4%) have spiked higher after Facebook (FB -0.5%) announces companies will be able to take OpenTable reservations and display Rovi TV listings data on their Facebook pages.
OpenTable has integration deals with 600+ sites/services. They currently account for 5%-10% of the company's monthly booked restaurant seats.
Facebook has made several moves in recent months (I, II) to improve the quality of the local content/services provided by its mobile site and apps. Yelp (YELP -1.2%) has sold off more than once thanks to those moves, but the company is still differentiated from Facebook (and other rivals) via the breadth of its local reviews database.
OpenTable's Facebook deal comes at a time when the company is seeing fresh competition from Yelp (remains a partner for now) and Groupon. It also comes shortly after OpenTable began testing a payments system for its restaurant bookings.

Bloomberg previously reported Facebook is looking to charge $1M-$2.5M/day for 15-second video ads, depending on audience reach, and AdAge reported Facebook is thinking of selling 4 daily video ad slots.
The WSJ also reports Mark Zuckerberg ""set an especially high bar"" for Facebook's video ad developer team. Zuck is reportedly intent on having video ads load quickly, and without alienating users or hurting engagement.
Ad execs state Facebook's video ads will automatically play without sound, and that a user will have to click/tap on an ad to enable audio.
The ads will ""appear prominently"" in news feeds, and users will be ""exposed to one video advertiser per day."" They'll be able to see additional ads from an advertiser by swiping right-to-left. Several major brands are reportedly on board.
