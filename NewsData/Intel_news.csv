Taiwan-based IC design sources expect Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPU shortage to ""ease significantly"" in 1Q19, according to DigiTimes.
The design houses expect to receive a fresh wave of orders from downstream PC and notebook clients as early as February.
In September, Intel confirmed it had tight CPU supplies but thought it had enough to at least meet the FY revenue outlook. Intel attributed the shortage to ""surprising"" PC growth and added another $1B to its capex to help catch up.

        Intel (INTC +0.6%) says it sold $1B of its Xeon AI processor chips last year.               Intel is increasingly dependent on sales to data centers as PC sales falter. Data centers provide the computing power for mobile and web apps, which rely on AI for features like speech recognition.                Data center chief Navin Shenoy says the company has modified its CPUs to become more than 200 times better at AI training within the past several years.                     The $1B estimate comes from customers telling Intel they were buying chips for AI and from calculations based on how much of a customer’s data center is dedicated to AI.                   Intel shares have felt the pressure since the company announced its next-gen chips wouldn’t be released until 2020, which gives rival AMD (AMD +0.3%) a timing advantage.    Previously: Intel unveiling plans to stave off AMD (Aug. 7) "

 The Information details the breakdowns that led to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) closing its wearables division this month.               Intel spent $175M to acquire smart-spectacle company Recon Instruments in 2015. Initially, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich seemed passionate about the project but he then refused to fund an AR-chip project requested by Recon head Dan Eisenhardt.                Eisenhardt’s costly project would’ve taken over a decade to provide returns and Krzanich wanted results faster.                Intel started cutbacks and discontinued the Recon Jet spectacles last summer. Earlier this month, most of the Recon team was laid off when Intel closed the wearable device unit called New Devices Group.                The Information notes that this was one of Intel’s many failed diversification efforts that also include moving into cybersecurity with a $7.7B McAfee acquisition (Intel sold a 52% stake for $3.1B) and the $884M purchase of IoT software company Wind River, which Intel sold earlier this month for undisclosed terms.                   Intel shares are up 0.2% to $52.82.    Previously: Intel buys fitness smartglass maker Recon for reported ~$175M (June 17, 2015)Previously: Intel spins out Wind River unit to TPG (April 3) "

 Wireless companies are racing to get commercial 5G service out to customers before the calendar hits 2019, which likely means the first rollout won't quite resemble the eventual visions. Standards are still being written, but carriers are working to be the first to implement service using one element of those standards. Most work is coming after December's wrap-up of key elements of 5G new radio standards from 3GPP, the international standards body. Most launches will revolve around fixed wireless service that beams Internet into homes through the air rather than via cable, whereas what comes at first will be a far cry from what will be possible in a few years. The technology will call for millions of new antennas yet to be installed. AT&T (NYSE:T) meanwhile has pledged mobile 5G service coming in 2018 to a dozen cities, including Atlanta, Dallas and Waco, Texas. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is looking at a residential 5G launch in 3-5 markets in the second half, starting with Sacramento, Calif. Sprint (NYSE:S) is looking toward 2019 for its 5G network.

The company says it will publish security research on the flaw later today, but differs with Intel's take that the flaw might be widespread and affect various companies. ""To be clear, the security research team identified three variants targeting speculative execution,"" AMD says. ""The threat and the response to the three variants differ by microprocessor company, and AMD is not susceptible to all three variants.

 A potential $70/share bid for Qualcomm (QCOM +12.7%) from Broadcom (AVGO +5.5%) feels a ""little low,"" Nomura says, looking more toward a 50% premium typical to major deals in the sector. As far as Qualcomm's bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI -2.1%), there's a scenario where Broadcom buys both companies, sets a licensing deal with Apple, then spins off noncore operations that could help fund the deals, Nomura's Romit Shah says. The deal ""makes sense for a bunch of different reasons,"" including scale, high accretion to EPS and that it's a very strategic deal with both companies' presence in smartphones, Shah tells Bloomberg Television. Cavium (CAVM +3.4%) and AMD (AMD +2.5%) could benefit from such a merger, BofA Merrill Lynch says, while the implications are more mixed for Intel (INTC -1.6%), Skyworks (SWKS +1.3%), Qorvo (QRVO -0.6%) and Xilinx (XLNX +0.4%). Intel could face more competition in mobile processing but the pricing environment could improve. At SunTrust, analyst William Stein and team say Broadcom's ""tactic is sensible, strategy somewhat less clear to us."" The deal fits with Broadcom's longstanding approach to take over leading franchises, they write, but: ""Since we began covering AVGO, one major investor concern has been the company's exposure to the volatile handset market (~30% of sales). As QCOM has ~90% of sales from the handset market, it would take the combined company's exposure to ~65% of sales, potentially challenging our view that AVGO deserves an expanded P/E.""  "

A lower court upheld that decision in 2014.                   Last year, an ECJ advisor took Intel’s side but that wasn’t a binding legal decision.                   If the court rules in Intel’s favor, other antitrust appeals could gain more traction. Google topped Intel this year with a $2.9B fine after prioritizing its own shopping results over competitors.  Previously: Google meets with EU antitrust regulators today to outline changes (Aug. 29) "

Broxton was set to use Intel's next-gen Goldmont CPU cores and a 14nm manufacturing process.
An Intel spokeswoman says resources previously directed towards SoFIA/Broxton will go towards ""products that deliver higher returns and advance our strategy."" The company plans to pitch OEMs on Pentium and Celeron chips related to its new Apollo Lake platform (based on Goldmont) as a solution for tablets and low-end PCs. Its partnership with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip, through which Rockchip has been developing SoFIA SoCs, remains in place.
Broxton (originally due in 2015) had already been delayed, as had certain SoFIA SoCs. Apple and Samsung's heavy reliance on their own app processors, together with tough competition from Qualcomm and MediaTek, had limited Intel's mobile chip sales. The company's tablet volumes were down 44% Y/Y in Q1; ASP was ""up significantly.""

It also comes amid expectations Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem, among the products overseen by Evans, will be used within some iPhone 7 units. Earlier this week, Qualcomm execs appeared to confirm on the company's earnings call (without mentioning Apple by name) it won't be Apple's sole modem supplier going forward.
Meanwhile, rival AMD rose 52.3% today following news (announced in AMD's Q1 report) it's forming a JV with Chinese consortium THATIC to develop server SoCs for the Chinese market, and receiving up to $293M in related licensing fees. With THATIC partly led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a major government research academy), the deal is being seen as an attempt by China to lower its reliance on Intel server CPUs in favor of locally-developed chips.
The JV's SoCs are expected to rely on AMD's next-gen Zen CPU cores, which will debut on AMD chips made using Samsung/Globalfoundries' 14nm manufacturing process. MKM's Ian Ing, who upgraded AMD to Buy today, argues the JV's chips ""will prove to be a serious challenge"" to Intel's Chinese dominance.

 Amid a weak market in both PCs and handsets, Citigroup is expressing caution on semiconductor stocks that it says could decline 20% in the next few months, while still seeing glimmers of light. The automotive end market should be strongest, analyst Christopher Danely says, leading him to sector favorites Microchip Technology (MCHP +0.1%) and ON Semiconductor (ON +0.5%), along with Linear Technology (LLTC -0.6%) -- each of which has a heavy component of sales in automotive (in ON Semi's case, 33% of calendar-year sales). Ahead of today's earnings, Intel (INTC -0.1%) gets a note of caution. Citi's Jim Suva says PCs will decline 6% this year, worse than Intel's forecast.

604,Micron has 31% upside - Brean,"Apr. 17, 2016, 9:27 AM","

Aside from an upgrade by Raymond James on Friday, Brean Capital initiated coverage of Micro (NASDAQ:MU) with a Buy rating and $14/share price target, implying upside of 31%.
Brean: ""On October 20 2015, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) unexpectedly announced a plan to convert its 100%- owned CPU fab in Dalian, China into a NAND fab by 2H16. Intel expects to spend at least $3.5B over the next 3-5 years and could spend as much as $5.5B to convert this plant. With Samsung already shipping 3D NAND and other manufacturers following suit, we believe investors are concerned about the potential surfeit of NAND supply in the coming years and view a new large supplier negatively. While difficult to predict the timing of such NAND chips coming on line, we look for more discipline in the NAND industry similar to DRAM and believe both companies will work together to maximize profits.
""It is notable that 3D NAND devices are actually manufactured on older process nodes (35nm-50nm). 3D NAND will allow memory manufacturers to continue to increase capacity at a lower cost/GB than planar NAND. All NAND manufacturers have plans in place to move to 3D NAND, with Samsung being the first followed by all other manufacturers who started in the 2H15. In contrast to all other companies using a charge trap design, MU will continue to use a floating gate design for 3D.
""The DRAM industry has been under a consolidation wave over the past decade. At this point, the DRAM competitive landscape is much more concentrated, with three providers accounting for more than 90% of the market. While Samsung’s (OTC:SSNLF) behavior over the last year has proven that even under the “new paradigm” in Memory, the industry will still face supply-driven cyclicality. Logically, we believe the overriding consequence of consolidation will result in more disciplined supply growth in order for players to maximize profits, but in this capital-intensive space, we expect supply-driven up and down cycles such as that witnessed in 2013/14 and then 2015/16.""

""We expect to lengthen the amount of time we will utilize our 14 [nanometer] and out next-generation 10 [nanometer] process technologies, further optimizing out products and process technologies while meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions,"" reads a disclosure uncovered in Intel's (INTC -0.5%) 2015 10-K filing.
Traditionally, Intel's ""tick-tock"" cycle has resulted in two CPU platforms being launched for each manufacturing process (e.g. 22nm, 14nm) the company adopts: An initial platform (tick) that delivers performance and power benefits from the higher transistor densities enabled by a moving an existing architecture to a newer process, and a brand-new architecture (tock) that optimizes Intel's use of the process. Typically, a full tick-tock cycle has lasted about two years before a new one starts.
The 10-K disclosure and accompanying graphics suggest Intel is now willing to roll out three CPU platforms for a process. As it is, the company announced in July it's delaying the launch of its first 10nm CPU platform (Cannonlake, once expected in late 2016 or early 2017) to 2H17, and will instead roll out a third 14nm platform (Kaby Lake, succeeds Broadwell and Skylake) this year.
Intel's strategy change could lower its capex needs - the company has already been investing conservatively in recent years. At the same time, it could give foundry providers TSMC, Samsung, and Globalfoundries a chance to eliminate Intel's historical manufacturing process edge. TSMC plans to begin production for its 10nm process (believed to have a lower transistor density than Intel's 10nm process) in Q4, and migrate to 7nm in 2018.

Following a rough 2015 in which weak PC demand, slowing smartphone growth, plunging memory prices, and a late-year inventory correction all weighed, Wells Fargo's David Wong thinks a chip industry recovery is on the way.
His rating for the sector has been upped to Overweight from Market Weight, and his ratings for Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), and Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) in particular have been raised to Outperform. Outperform ratings are reiterated for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Linear (NASDAQ:LLTC), AMD, Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), and SunEdison Semi (NASDAQ:SEMI).
Wong argues 2016 chip industry growth could be as high as 7% (with growth reaching double-digits by year's end), and that 8%-14% growth is possible in 2017. Gartner estimates industry revenue fell 1.9% in 2015 to $333.7B.
Wong: ""Over the last 5 years 2010-2015, semiconductor industry growth has tracked below global GDP for the most part. We think this has created significant pent-up demand created by the deferral of electronics goods purchases and aging of the installed base of electronics systems ... We think that there could well be the first signs of improvement in the year/year comparisons at some point in the June 2016 quarter in the many of the broader chip markets, including the industrial, communications infrastructure and PC markets.""
Some expectations for a recovery might already be priced in: The Philadelphia Semi Index (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up 18% from a February low of $74.80. However, it's still down 13% from a June high of $101.80.
Earlier today, Broadcom (the company produced by the Avago/Broadcom merger) posted big gains after beating January quarter estimates and issuing healthy April quarter guidance. On its earnings call, Broadcom forecast solid April quarter growth for its wired infrastructure (telecom/networking chip) segment, and a 2H16 recovery for its mobile chip segment (recently hurt by soft iPhone-related demand). More cautious outlooks were provided for Broadcom's storage and industrial segments.

He estimates the company could supply 30%-40% of the modems going into the device. Pajjuri thinks such a win would boost Intel's revenue and earnings by 1.5%-2%, and respectively hurt current iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm's (QCOM -1.2%) revenue and earnings by 4% and 2%.

VentureBeat reported back in March 2015 Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem (450Mbps peak download speeds) would go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. The site followed up in October by stating Intel ""now has a thousand people or more"" working to get the XMM 7360 designed into an iPhone, and that Apple is interested in eventually developing an SoC pairing a 4G modem with an A-series app processor, with Intel manufacturing the SoC and providing modem IP.
Qualcomm is still viewed as having a modem performance lead on the high-end. The company recently unveiled a modem (the Snapdragon X16) supporting 1Gbps peak download speeds, while adding the chip is expected to go into commercial products in 2H16.
Separately, Baird's Tristan Gerra has upgraded Intel to Outperform, and hiked his target by $5 to $38. He cites healthy DCG (server CPU division) growth and (without naming Apple) the potential for a major ""tier-1 smartphone ramp"" in 2H16.
Gerra: ""After being on the sidelines for a few years on Intel, we think data center has reached sufficient critical mass within Intel's mix to drive a resumption in EPS growth starting in 2017 ... Assuming a low single-digit decline in annual PC revenue and a high single-digit growth rate in data center (below Intel's 15% growth target), DCG mix becomes large enough to drive EPS growth starting in 2017 and in years forward ... We believe Intel's LTE technology has matured, improving Intel's positioning for a potential tier-one smartphone ramp this second half.""

It adds Google and Qualcomm have cooperated on design work, and that the former will commit to using the latter's chips if they meet performance goals.
Google is the world's biggest server buyer, and has largely relied on Intel's (INTC -4.1%) Xeon CPUs. The Web giant's adoption of Qualcomm processors, even if for only a fraction of its workload, would act as a major reference win for the fledgling ARM server CPU market. There has been speculation Amazon might also adopt ARM server CPUs, following its acquisition of chip startup Annapurna Labs (recently unveiled a line of low-end network processors).
Qualcomm is just four months removed from showing off a prototype ARM server CPU featuring custom cores. The company has been hoping the server market will provide a long-term sales lift as it continues dealing with mobile pressures - Qualcomm's chip division (QCT) sales fell 22% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $4.1B.

OCP could aid carrier efforts to adopt network functions virtualization (NFV), which allows switching, routing, and other networking functions to be handled by software running on commodity hardware. AT&T aims to virtualize over 75% of its network functions by 2020, Verizon, meanwhile, has been testing commodity switches running on software supplied by startups.
Switch/router giant Cisco (CSCO -1.3%) could see its carrier sales pressured if OCP-based hardware is widely adopted by telcos. Facebook has been contributing modular data center switch designs to OCP. Meanwhile, startup Big Switch Networks has contributed a Linux-based network OS that supports switching and routing.
Intel (INTC -0.6%), on the other hand, could benefit, as many OCP designs rely on the company's CPUs. On its Q4 earnings call (transcript), Intel estimated it had less than 10% telecom/networking penetration, and predicted the market would be a 2016 growth driver for its Data Center Group (DCG). The company also talked up its networking opportunity during its November investor day, and noted AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, and SK Telecom have deployed Intel-based NFV solutions.

626,"Macquarie upgrades Intel, declares 2016 CPU restocking a catalyst","Jan. 25, 2016, 11:11 AM","

Believing Intel (INTC -0.2%) under-shipped end-market demand for all of 2015, and that this ""adds potential upside to estimates as the PC supply chain replenishes processor inventories,"" Macquarie's Deepon Nag has upgraded the chip giant to Outperform. His target remains $35.
Nag also argues Intel's dividend (3.5% forward yield based on an increased quarterly dividend of $0.26/share) provides downside protection should a global downturn arrive. The upgrade comes less than two weeks after Intel tumbled in the wake of a Q4 beat - slowing server CPU growth and cautious commentary about Chinese/Asian demand weighed on shares.
Intel's desktop and notebook CPU volumes respectively fell 9% and 10% Y/Y in Q4; ASP increases of 9% and 6% limited the revenue impact. IDC and Gartner respectively estimate PC shipments fell 10.6% and 8.3% Y/Y in Q4; IDC's figure improves by ~600 bps if one counts detachable tablet shipments.

628,Chip equipment makers underperform after Intel cuts capex budget; analysts defend,"Jan. 15, 2016, 2:26 PM","


Up strongly yesterday as markets rallied and TSMC set a 2016 capex budget of $9B-$10B (up from 2015 capex of $8.12B), a slew of chip equipment makers are seeing big losses amid a 3.3% Nasdaq drop after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) used its Q4 report to disclose its 2016 capex budget has been cut by $500M to $9.5B (+/- $500M). That's still up by $2.2B at the midpoint from 2015's $7.3B, but lower than the $10.1B-$11B spent annually from 2011-2014.
On Intel's earnings call (transcript), CEO Brian Krzanich indicated the budget cut is related to logic (i.e. CPU) capex, and insisted no specific major factor was responsible. ""As we went from the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the team has just sharpened down all the numbers and went through it in more detail.""
Major decliners: Applied Materials (AMAT -4.3%), Lam Research (LRCX -6.5%), KLA-Tencor (KLAC -3.8%), ASML (ASML -6.3%), MKS Instruments (MKSI -3.9%), Ultratech (UTEK -4.9%), Teradyne (TER -3.1%), Advantest (ATE -4.6%), and Ultra Clean (UCTT -5.2%).

Stifel's Patrick Ho argues the selloff is a buying opportunity. ""[W]e have already seen positive preannouncements with two of our names (Ultra Clean, Axcelis) and we expect more upside surprise than those on the downside ... We believe 3D NAND momentum continues to build while there has been some initial buying for 10nm logic (Intel) and foundry (TSMC). We maintain our industry thesis that 3D NAND spending will be the largest incremental driver for spending in 2016, with upside potential from the foundries in 2H16 related to 10nm investments."" He likes Applied, Lam, Teradyne, and MKS.
Credit Suisse's Farhan Ahmad notes Applied, ASML, and Lam have relatively low Intel exposure, and that a Korea Times report indicates DRAM/NAND flash maker SK Hynix's capex might increase in 2016. On the other hand, he's worried current expectations for EUV system shipments (important for ASML) are too optimistic.
Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), another top-3 chip equipment buyer, reports after the Jan. 21 close. Citi's Atif Malik sees Samsung cutting capex due to lower DRAM-related spending. ""We think Samsung moderating memory spend, particularly DRAM, would improve memory supply-demand balance and sustainability of memory equipment spend in C16.""

629,"Intel tumbles below $30 post-earnings; Street worried about China, servers","Jan. 15, 2016, 1:29 PM","

Intel (INTC -8.5%) has received a mixture of target hikes and cuts (and no downgrades) after posting a Q4 beat, providing above-consensus sales guidance (aided by the Altera acquisition), and reporting weaker-than-expected Data Center Group (DCG) sales growth. Nonetheless, shares have dropped below $30 for the first time since October.
Aside from DCG's performance, analysts have voiced concern about earnings call remarks (transcript) indicating Chinese demand, as well as Asian demand in general, is soft among both consumers and enterprises. CEO Brian Krzanich: ""I would say [the weakness] is a little bit heavier on the client-side, so the PC side than the data center side, but we are seeing some of it on the data center side as well...""
Goldman's James Covello (Sell rating): ""Intel noted that organic 1Q trends are at the low end of seasonal, primarily due to weaker demand in China in consumer and enterprise PCs, which in turn drove higher internal inventory; We believe investors will be focused on whether DCG growth can return to the mid-teens target range after three quarters of sub-15% [Y/Y] growth...""
Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon (Market Perform): ""We had already believed “mid-teens” growth targets for DCG are optimistic, a point of view that seems to be gaining credibility given the company’s commentary on end demand. And of course PCs still don’t look great either ... Our estimates go up, but the drivers are low-quality, and purely non-operational (exclusion of amortization, a lower tax rate, and the aforementioned accounting games).""
MKM's Ian Ing (Buy): ""Intel has turned more cautious on growth since the November analyst day, particularly given uncertain China ... This not only affects client computing but data center as well, as management affirmed only double-digit growth for this segment instead of a mid-teens target.""
Rosenblatt's Kinngai Chan (no rating): ""While the current demand climate remains soft due to uncertainty in the emerging market regions, we believe Intel could begin to outperform starting from 2Q16 mainly due to product cycle refresh in both the Datacenter and the PC client segments.""
Also mentioned on the earnings call 1) Krzanich argues growing sales to the telco/networking market (where Intel has less than 10% penetration, and where NFV growth is providing a lift) will help DCG deliver double-digit 2016 growth. 2) PC CPU ASPs benefited from higher sales of Intel's Core i7 and gamer-focused K-series CPUs. 3) Over 40% of server CPU volumes for cloud clients involved custom SKUs. 4) Memory sales rose over 20% Y/Y.

Helping Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) deliver a big Q4 EPS beat: Gross margin was 64.3%, +130 bps Q/Q and -110 bps Y/Y, and above a guidance midpoint of 62%. Q1 non-GAAP GM guidance is also at 62% (+/-2%). Full-year GM guidance is at 63% (+/- 2%).
Also helping: Intel's tax rate was just 16%, down from 26.9% in Q3 and 21.4% a year ago. 2016 tax rate guidance is at ~25%. Meanwhile, the 2016 capex budget has been cut by $500M to $9.5B (+/- $500M). (Intel's November guidance)

Server CPUs: Worrying the Street: Data Center Group (DCG - server CPU/network processor) revenue rose just 5% Y/Y in Q4 to $4.31B, after growing 12% in Q3. Volumes +7% Y/Y, ASPs -1%. Division op. income fell 4% Y/Y to $2.17B. Intel previously forecast a 15% CAGR for DCG through 2018.

PC/mobile CPUs: Aided by Intel's Skylake CPU ramp and a positive mix shift, Client Computing Group revenue fell just 1% Y/Y to $8.76B in spite of a weak PC market, an improvement from Q3's 7% drop. Volumes -16% Y/Y, but ASPs +17%. Desktop volumes -9%, ASPs +9%. Notebooks volumes -10%, ASPs +6%. Tablet volumes -33%, ASPs ""up significantly."" Division op. income -4% to $2.72B.

632,PC sales down strongly again in Q4; 2016 stabilization expected,"Jan. 12, 2016, 5:56 PM","

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Annapurna Labs chip unit, acquired a year ago for a reported $350M, has unveiled (amid CES) a set of 32-bit and 64-bit ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) processors for home gateways, Wi-Fi routers, and NAS storage appliances, along with related subsystems.
The chips, to be sold under the Alpine label, target a low-end networking/storage processor market in which Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), Cavium (CAVM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Broadcom (BRCM) are notable players. Annapurna suggests the Alpine line will be differentiated in part by offering superior general-purpose computing power, thus allowing it to support more higher-level services. It also promises Alpine will support 4K video streaming 10G Ethernet and PCIe Gen3 connectivity, low power consumption, and enterprise-class reliability.
Asus and Netgear plan to use Alpine. To date, Amazon has been tight-lipped about its plans for Annapurna. There has been speculation the Israeli chipmaker will develop low-power ARM server CPUs that will go into AWS' data centers. For now, AWS continues relying on Intel's x86 server CPUs.

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) November hiring of Qualcomm vet Murthy Renduchintala to head a new and massive Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group is just one of many noteworthy recent hires of outsiders, observes long-time chip analyst and Linley Group chief Linley Gwennap.
Renduchintala's arrival was preceded by the 2014 hiring of Amir Faintuch, previously the head of Qualcomm's Atheros Wi-Fi chip unit, to head Intel's Platform Engineering Group (handles chip R&D). Gwennap notes Faintuch, who once more reports to Renduchintala, has ""already brought in other outsiders such as Anwar Awad (from Synopsys), Amit Baruch (Samsung), Shawn Covell (Qualcomm), Mark Davis (Via Telecom), Charlie Matar (AMD), Ari Rauch (AMD), and Howard Wright (Qualcomm) to hold VP-level positions.""
He sees the hiring spree potentially changing a ""not invented here"" culture at Intel, and in doing so shortening chip development cycles and improving Intel's ability to go after non-core markets. A greater willingness to use ARM CPU cores (previously strongly discouraged by management) is also deemed a possibility.
Gwennap cautions such a management/culture shakeup can be disruptive and alienate employees if not handled well. ""The key is for the new managers to recognize Intel’s many strengths, including industry-leading IC technology, excellent engineers, and a broad IP portfolio. If they can harness these strengths while improving workflow and accelerating development time, Intel will have a better chance at winning in new markets.""

During his presentation (.pdf), CFO Stacy Smith guide for mid-teens Data Center Group (DCG, server CPUs/network processors) 2016 revenue growth, in-line with the 4-year CAGR forecast Intel provided last year (aided by Altera?). The Client Computing Group (CCG, PC/mobile CPUs) is expected to see flat to low-single digit sales growth, with low-double digit op. profit growth due to improved mobile CPU profitability.
Gross margin is expected to benefit from higher ASPs, and be pressured by 3D XPoint investments and 10nm start-up costs. Notably, Intel expects only 1/3 of 2016 DCG revenue to come from traditional enterprise server sales. 1/3 are expected to come from cloud service providers (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.), and 1/3 from HPC, workstation, networking, and storage systems. The CCG outlook assumes a slight decline in PC unit sales.
Sterne Agee's Doug Freedman (Buy): ""INTC highlighted non-consumer group segments make up 40% of total revenue in 2015 while contributing 65% of the operating profit ... Management noted the ongoing weakness in traditional enterprise market but continued to expect strong growth to be driven by robust demands in cloud service provider and high performance computing.""
Freedman considers capex guidance better than feared. As does Cowen's Tim Arcuri (Market Perform), who also thinks gross margin guidance is conservative.
Roth's Krishna Shankar (Buy) is a little worried about the traction seen by ARM server CPU vendors AppliedMicro (AMCC -0.4%) and Cavium (CAVM -1.1%). ""Beyond 2015, we believe that Intel’s quasi-monopoly in high-margin servers (95% market share in server platforms) may be challenged by new low-power ARM-based server platforms for the high growth cloud services, social networking/video-delivery market."" Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann (Underperform) states CEO Brian Krzanich admitted Intel's server CPU forecast accounts for share ""degradation.""
SA author Bruce Burnworth is upbeat about DCG's growth outlook. Among other things, he notes Intel respectively sees $5B and $1.6B 2020 addressable markets for silicon photonics and Omni-Path, and a major opportunity to grow networking sales as carriers adopt network functions virtualization (NFV, involves migrating networking functions to software running on commodity hardware).

649,"Intel looks to grow HPC server market with new architecture, high-speed fabric","Nov. 16, 2015, 5:53 PM","

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has used the supercomputer industry's SC15 conference to unveil SSF, a high-performance computing (HPC) system architecture meant to make HPC deployments easier for enterprises that have remained on the fence to date.
Intel notes HPC deployments, a bright spot in a soft enterprise server market, have expanded beyond traditional use cases such as DNA sequencing, nuclear simulations, and weather modeling to cover a variety of corporate analytics workloads. The company argues a system-level approach will help eliminate system bottlenecks, and allow enterprises to use a common infrastructure for numerous HPC and non-HPC workloads.
Central to SSF is Omni-Path (OPA), a high-speed interconnect fabric for HPC server nodes (first outlined by Intel a year ago) running on Intel CPUs. OPA is promised to enable switches that are both cheaper and more power-efficient than ones relying on InfiniBand interconnects (widely used in HPC deployments). Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many other OEMs plan to offer OPA-based switches and servers, which are expected to ramp in early 2016.
Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX), the top player in the InfiniBand interconnect market, is in the crosshairs. Earlier today, Mellanox announced Switch-IB 2, an InfiniBand switch supporting 100G port speeds and (notably) embedded processing power for offloading communications tasks from server CPUs.
Along with SSF, Intel has announced Knights Landing, the latest entry for its Xeon Phi co-processor line, will be generally available in Q1 2016; Intel was previously aiming for a late 2015 launch. Knights Landing features 72 CPU cores and 16GB of on-package DRAM, and promises big performance gains over the current-gen Knights Corner. It takes aim at Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tesla GPU line, which remains the biggest player in the HPC co-processor market.
Aside from potentially growing the HPC market, SSF/Omni-Path could boost Intel's dollar content for various enterprise server deployments, as it continues pursuing a 15% Data Center Group revenue CAGR through 2018. Altera, whose FPGAs can be paired with Xeon CPUs to accelerate HPC workloads (among other things), could also aid in boosting dollar content.

Raytheon's (RTN -0.5%) Websense security software unit is buying Intel's (INTC -1.8%) Finnish Stonesoft firewall/next-gen firewall unit, which was acquired by the chip giant in 2013 for $389M. Terms are unknown for now.
Trade site CRN has picked up a memo from Websense CEO John McCormack confirming the deal. The memo states Websense will be adding 300 employees, and that the deal is expected to close by year's end.
Stonesoft's hardware has been sold under the McAfee brand. From all indications, it has had a tough time competing against the likes of Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Check Point.
Earlier this year, Intel re-branded its McAfee unit as Intel Security, and formerly integrated the business with the rest of the company. More recently, Intel unveiled a security strategy focused on cloud and endpoint (device) protection. A new version of McAfee Endpoint Security (version 10.X) was announced, as was a new threat-detection/incident-response tool called McAfee Active Response.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ""now has a thousand people or more working to outfit a 2016 iPhone"" with its XMM 7360 2G/3G/4G modem, sources tell VentureBeat. It adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may dual-source its 2016 iPhone modems via Intel and current supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
That meshes with a March VentureBeat report stating the XMM 7360 will go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Though an August Northland Securities report forecast Intel will supply modems for some iPhone 6S/6S+ units, teardowns indicate Apple is solely relying on Qualcomm's MDM9635M modem.
The MDM9635M supports 300Mbps peak download speeds, and the XMM 7360 450Mbps peak speeds. Qualcomm, whose high-end modems are generally considered to have a performance/power consumption edge, recently unveiled the X12, which supports 600Mbps peak speeds and will be integrated with its Snapdragon 820 processor.
Also: VentureBeat reports Apple would like to eventually develop an SoC that features both an A-series app processor and a 4G modem, and which would be manufactured using Intel's 14nm process. The site also suggests Apple is interested in Intel's 10nm process (due in 2017).
Intel would provide modem IP for the SoC in addition to manufacturing the chip. To date, Intel has paired discrete A-series processors manufactured by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) with 3rd-party modems (in recent years, Qualcomm's). Intel recently bought 3G CDMA modem assets (needed to service Verizon, Sprint, China Telecom, and certain other carriers) from Taiwan's VIA Telecom.

655,Intel turns positive post-earnings as chip stocks rally,"Oct. 14, 2015, 1:48 PM","

Intel (INTC +1.8%) started the day lower after delivering a Q3 beat with the help of strong PC CPU ASPs, providing in-line Q4 guidance, and cutting its full-year server CPU division (DCG) growth forecast. Helping out: The Philadelphia Semi Index is up 3.3%, buoyed by reports SanDisk and Fairchild are on the block.
Summit Research's Srini Sundarajan has upgraded Intel to Buy, and several other firms have hiked their targets. Sundarajan: ""Guidance was easily achieved in C3Q15 despite a fall in number of units due to customer preference for latest and greatest ... Future is systems with Skylake, DDR4 and Windows 10 which are doing extremely well and allowing ASP appreciation even with a tepid backdrop.""
B. Riley's Craig Ellis (Buy): ""Positives are robust [PC division] ASPs, continued 10%+ yy growth in 40% of sales (DCG, IoT, Memory), in-line to better GM from high levels, accelerating mobile operating loss reduction, and a $400MM down-tick in capex. Negatives are moderately weaker than expected PC units and DCG’s enterprise weakness.”
Roth's Krishna Shankar (Buy): ""We believe that new PC platforms such as Skylake on 14nm technology with new Windows10 PC upgrade cycle and continued strength in datacenter segment will likely drive 2016 results. Intel’s NVM memory business is observing robust growth driven by enterprise/datacenter SSD storage, while the embedded and IOT segment sees good growth due to trends such as [SDN] and NFV platforms on Intel architecture and evolving M2M and embedded Internet connectivity.""
On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore (Underweight) thinks some of Intel's PC ASP gains are temporary, fueled by a mix shift towards developed markets, low-end inventory burnoff, and stronger replacement rates on the high-end. Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann (Underperform) suspects DCG growth will be pressured going forward by price discounts meant to discourage clients from adopting ARM server CPUs.
On the earnings call (transcript), CFO Stacy Smith stated enterprise server demand has been weaker than expected, and cloud demand (partly coming at the expense of enterprise as cloud service adoption continues) stronger than expected. He also downplayed Intel's latest capex budget cut, suggesting the spending has simply been pushed out to 2016. ""CapEx will be up some next year, but we will talk much more about that in November.""
CEO Brian Krzanich echoed various analysts in asserting ""there are signs that the PC market is beginning to stabilize."" Smith noted the high-end Core i7 line (refreshed via Skylake) was a strong point in Q3. PC demand within emerging markets and ""non-consumer segments"" remained soft.

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.8% Y/Y in Q3 to nearly 71M units, a drop nearly as large as Q2's 11.8% and above a 9.2% projection. Gartner estimates shipments fell 7.7% to 73.7M.
IDC: ""Across many regions, the channel remained focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory before a more complete portfolio of models incorporating Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake processors comes on the scene ... Though easing a bit, currency devaluation continued to inhibit PC shipments in the third quarter. While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware.""
Nonetheless, IDC is ""optimistic"" about a demand pickup. ""While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware...""
Likewise, Gartner expects ""more stable market conditions"" in 2016. It's also pleased the U.S. notebook and ""premium ultramobile"" segments saw positive growth. Various analysts have reported seeing signs of stabilizing PC demand.
With tablet sales also under pressure, tablet cannibalization is less of an issue than before. The ability of older PCs to handle mainstream computing tasks without trouble (including on Windows 10) may be a bigger problem. Many in the industry are hoping 4K video and/or virtual reality will fuel upgrades.

""Taiwan notebook ODM shipments increased 16% MoM in August, above our Citi Asia Hardware Analyst William Yang’s estimate of up 10% MoM and above the three year average of up 6% MoM,"" writes Citi's Chris Danely, arguing PC demand is improving after a very rough Q1 and Q2.
Danely adds Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has ""indicated PC demand appears to have bottomed, and PC OEMs have started to replenish inventory driven by the Skylake processor ramp,"" and that Micron (NASDAQ:MU) has ""stated DRAM spot prices have started to stabilize, which the company believes is a sign of a bottom in the PC market."" IT distributor Ingram Micro (NYSE:IM) is also said to be seeing stabilizing demand.
Wells Fargo's David Wong sings a similar tune. ""There have been signs of a seasonal pickup in PC builds. Month of August sales data reported by Taiwanese notebook and motherboard/computer makers shows a clear month-over-month lift in PC builds in August, and solid growth in the first two months of the September quarter compared to the first two months of the June quarter.""
Likely helping: Windows 10 (free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) launched in late July to decent reviews, and Intel has since gradually rolled out its 14nm Skylake CPU line. After starting off by launching the gamer/enthusiast-focused Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K desktop CPUs, Intel has rolled out the Skylake Y-series (meant for tablets and compute sticks), U-series (ultrabooks/convertibles), H-series (notebooks), and S-series (desktops). Sizable power/efficiency and GPU performance gains are generally promised relative to comparable 14nm Broadwell CPUs.

Believing PC sales are set to rebound as the holidays arrive and businesses buy Windows 10 systems, Northland's Gus Richard has upgraded Intel (INTC +2.3%) to Outperform, and set a $32 target.Richard also argues sales of integrated CPU/FPGA solutions made possible by the Altera acquisition will benefit from the growing concentration of computing power at network edges, and calls Intel and Micron's 3D XPoint memory a potential game-changer.Separately, Canaccord's Matt Ramsay argues Intel can still hit a 15% long-term revenue CAGR target for its server CPU division (DCG), following a Q2 in which DCG only posted 10% growth. He notes management reiterated confidence DCG can see 15% 2015 growth with the help of strong cloud and networking-related growth.Ramsay has slightly cut his 2015 DCG growth estimate to 14.2% from 15% on account of China-related concerns, and his 2015 and 2016 EPS estimates by a penny to $2.16 and $2.59.

671,Intel invests $60M+ in drone maker; shares close up 5.5% as Nasdaq surges,"Aug. 26, 2015, 6:55 PM","

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) prolific VC arm has invested over $60M into Chinese consumer/industrial drone maker Yuneec. The companies will collaborate on future products, presumably while leveraging Intel CPUs. CEO Brian Krzanich: “We’ve got drones on our road map that are going to truly change the world and revolutionize the drone industry.”
Intel has previously invested in two other drone companies - Airware and PrecisionHawk - as it looks to gain ground against ARM-based CPUs within the budding market. Qualcomm, for its part, has invested in U.S. drone maker 3D Robotics. China's DJI (valued at $10B in a recent funding round) remains the top player in the consumer drone segment.

Earlier this week, Intel announced it led a $100M funding round in Mirantis, a top provider of software and managed services for the popular OpenStack cloud infrastructure platform. Other recent investments include Glyph, a VR headset maker, and BlueData, a provider of software for running server clusters for the Hadoop and Spark big data platforms. A big investment was made last year in leading Hadoop software vendor Cloudera.

674,Reports: Intel will have to wait until 2016 to take iPhone share from Qualcomm,"Aug. 24, 2015, 7:08 PM","

Two weeks after Northland Securities predicted Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will have a ~50% iPhone 6S modem share, Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann reports ""multiple [Silicon] Valley datapoints"" suggest Intel will take iPhone share in 2016, not 2015, via its XMM 7360 4G modem.
Mosesmann: ""At IDF, the Street got the opportunity to meet newly promoted GM of the Communications and Devices Group, Aicha Evans, who refreshingly and bluntly told the audience of analysts and investors that if Intel couldn’t get to scale in modems, it would basically be done. Our sense is that she knows it will have scale and Apple is that avenue.""
Cowen's Tim Arcuri also doubts Intel will take 6S share from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in 2015, but leaves the door open to other wins. ""[F]ield work with carriers and otherwise suggests QCOM will keep thin [modem] for 6S and 6S+. While we believe INTC has been evaluated for 6C (the 4″ model expected in CQ1:16), checks w/carriers and otherwise still do not support a new premium-tier modem – the addition of which would require at least 9 months of extensive testing (lab, interoperability, etc.) to get approval from the large US carriers.""
He adds checks also suggest Samsung will use both Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 app processor and its own Exynos processors in the Galaxy S7, after using only the Exynos 7420 in the Galaxy S6. Recently-leaked Samsung docs suggest the 820 is being tested by Samsung with the S7.

VentureBeat reported earlier this year Apple plans to use Intel 4G modems in 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Meanwhile, Digitimes has reported Qualcomm is ""partnering with TSMC to supply 100% of the modem chips for use in the new iPhones slated for launch in September 2015.""

Intel's (INTC -0.8%) RealSense gesture recognition camera/sensor technology (first announced in 2014) has received attention on the first day of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). The chip giant says RealSense will now support Linux, Mac OS, and several other platforms, in addition to Windows and Android, and also work with Google's Project Tango, which uses cameras and sensors to create 3D maps of a user's surroundings on Android devices.
Also announced by Intel: Optane, an SSD platform that combines the company's 3D XPoint next-gen memory (recently announced in partnership with Micron) related controllers, interface hardware, and software. In a demo, an Optane SSD delivered over 5x the IOPS performance of Intel's high-end P3700 NAND flash SSD.
The first Optane drives will launch in 2016. Potential use cases include performance-optimized enterprise and Web/cloud servers, as well as high-end PCs and workstations.
In addition, Intel has announced partnerships with microcontroller vendors Atmel (ATML -1.7%) and Microchip (MCHP -1.4%) to integrate its EPID privacy tech - it allows cloud services to be quickly/securely provisioned to Web-connected devices - with Atmel/Microchip's products, which are used to power many embedded systems.

677,Northland: Intel taking iPhone modem share from Qualcomm with 6S launch,"Aug. 12, 2015, 12:39 PM","

""We now believe that Intel (INTC +0.9%) will capture roughly 50% of Apple’s modem business in the upcoming iPhones due to launch September 9th,"" writes Northland Securities' Gus Richard. ""[W]e estimate that this win could represent $750M to $1.25B in revenue for Intel in [2016]. This is a marque win for Intel and would go a long way to reducing the mobile business losses.""
At the same time, Richard is concerned Alibaba plans to deploy ARM-based (ARMH -3.3%) server CPUs developed by Cavium (CAVM -1.7%), and reports hearing Amazon, Facebook, and Google are working on their own ARM server CPU designs. Major Web/cloud service providers currently rely overwhelmingly on Intel server CPUs (primarily Xeon).
Qualcomm (QCOM -0.9%) has been the iPhone's exclusive baseband modem supplier for some time, and also sells complementary RF transceiver, power management, receive-only, and envelope-tracking ICs to Apple. VentureBeat reported in March Apple plans to use Intel modems in 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets.
Qualcomm suggested last month Apple's high-end smartphone share gains were partly responsible for its soft FQ4 (calendar Q3) guidance. However, this was generally seen as a reference to the fact Apple uses home-grown app processors (the A-series) within the iPhone rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon line. The company has dominated the 4G modem market to date, and is generally seen as having a high-end performance/power consumption edge.
Separately, Qualcomm has unveiled its next-gen GPU core architecture, the Adreno 5xx. Qualcomm promises up to 40% improvements in performance and power draw relative to the prior-gen Adreno 430. The first GPUs based on the architecture will go into the company's upcoming Snapdragon 820 (next-gen flagship) and 620/618 (mid-range) processors.
Intel is up modestly in spite of a 1% Nasdaq drop. Qualcomm is following markets lower.

The first CPUs based on Intel's (INTC - unchanged) anticipated 14nm Skylake CPU platform (the successor to the 14nm Broadwell, launched last year) are the quad-core Core i7-6700K (4GHz.) and Core i5-6600K (3.5GHz.).
The overclocking-friendly chips are aimed at gamers/enthusiasts, have MSRPs of $350 and $243, and (given Intel has only launched less powerful Broadwell parts) succeed the Core i7-4790K and i5-4690K (i.e. Devil's Canyon), which are based on the 22nm Haswell architecture. Unlike their predecessors, and like Intel's 8-core i7-5820K (also based on Haswell), the chips support DDR4 DRAM. They also support high-speed PCIe 3.0 storage and more high-speed I/O lanes, and (though gamers would doubtlessly opt for a graphics card) contain a faster integrated GPU.

AnandTech's tests turned up just an average 5% gain for the 6700K relative to the 4790K, albeit with much larger gains for certain benchmarks such as HandBrake (video encoding) and Google Octane (JavaScript). DDR4 yielded only a modest performance improvement over DDR3, but AnandTech notes the technology also provides density and power draw advantages.
Skylake notebook/tablet CPUs are due in the coming months, as are cheaper desktop CPUs. More details are expected at the Aug. 18-20 Intel Developers Forum.

The NAND JV partners declare 3D XPoint ""significantly reduces latencies, allowing much more data to be stored close to the processor and accessed at speeds previously impossible for non-volatile storage."" Unique materials and a cross point array structure are said to make 3D XPoint possible.
Major write endurance improvements are also promised relative to NAND. The first product will be a 128Gb (16GB) chip.
Intel/Micron are sharing additional at a San Francisco event (webcast). Shares of both companies are higher amid a 0.6% gain for the Nasdaq.

Update: More details from Fortune. 3D XPoint samples are expected by year's end, and commercial shipments are set for 2016.

Update 2: During the Q&A session for the announcement, the cost for 3D XPoint is said to be ""somewhere between"" that of NAND and DRAM. Intel/Micron affirm their commitment to 3D NAND, while noting its high densities.

Update 3: Both Intel and Micron plan to make 3D XPoint products. Micron CEO Mark Durcan claims he doesn't know of any comparable rival products on the way, and predicts 3D XPoint will be used for both storage (like NAND) and main memory (like DRAM).

On Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q2 CC (webcast), CEO Brian Krzanich stated his company doesn't plan to launch its first 10nm CPU platform until the second half of 2017. The platform, previously codenamed Cannonlake and more recently referred to as Ice Lake, was expected to arrive by late 2016 or early 2017.
Krzanich: ""The last two technology transitions have signaled that our cadence today is closer to 2½ years than two.” To hold users over between the its first 10nm chips and its 14nm Skylake CPUs (due later this year), Intel plans to roll out a 3rd-gen 14nm platform (codenamed Kaby Lake) in 2016. The disclosure coincides with a $1B 2015 capex budget cut.
On the bright side, Intel remains upbeat about server CPU division (DCG) sales - the company previously forecast a 15% CAGR for DCG through 2018 - and predicts Skylake and Windows 10 will drive a seasonal pickup in PC demand following a very rough Q1/Q2.

Not surprisingly, many analysts argue a much higher bid will be needed to win over management and/or are doubtful regulators would allow a Chinese company to buy Micron. UBS' Stephen Chin: “Valuation appears low as a potential $21 a share bid is 8.3 times fiscal year 2016 PE or low end of the historic range of 7 to 15 times whereas Micron’s stock was at $32 just 5 months ago.”

State-owned Chinese tech firm Tsinghua Unigroup has prepped a $23B, or $21/share, bid to acquire U.S. DRAM/NAND flash giant Micron (NASDAQ:MU), the WSJ reports.

With Micron having started the year trading in the mid-30s - shares were still in the mid-20s a few weeks ago - there's a good chance management rejects the offer, which could prove to simply be an opening bid. If Micron agrees to a deal with Tsinghua, U.S. regulators are likely to closely scrutinize it.

690,IDC: PC sales fell 11.8% Y/Y in Q2,"Jul. 9, 2015, 10:02 PM","


IDC estimates global PC shipments tumbled to 66.1M in Q2, falling at a sharper Y/Y clip than Q1's 6.7% and about 1% faster than expected. Gartner is slightly less harsh, estimating shipments fell 9.5% to 68.4M.
Factors blamed for the decline: Inventory reductions ahead of the Windows 10 launch (set for July 29), a strong dollar (has led to higher overseas prices), and tough Y/Y comps caused by the 2014 boost in business PC sales caused by the end of Windows XP support. With tablet sales under pressure as well, tablet cannibalization is less of a factor than before ... but rising smartphone/tablet usage still appears to be taking a toll on PC upgrade rates.
Gartner sees full-year shipments falling 4.4%. IDC still expects low-to-mid single-digit declines in 2H15, before volumes stabilize in future years. It sees the Windows 10 launch going ""relatively well,"" but cautions Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to provide free upgrades to Windows 7/8 users will limit its impact on PC sales.
Continuing a recent trend, market leaders grabbed share from smaller rivals. IDC estimates #1 Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose to 20.3% from 19.4% a year ago, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) to 18.5% from 18.2%, and #3 Dell's to 14.5% from 14%. Acer (OTC:ASIYF) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) are respectively given 6.6% and 6.5% shares
Curiously, IDC has Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranked #4 globally, with its share rising to 7.8% from 5.9% via 5.1M Mac shipments (could imply a 15%+ revenue share), but Gartner doesn't have the company in its top-5. IDC and Gartner respectively assign Apple 13.5% and 12.7% U.S. shares. In the past, IDC's Mac shipment estimates have been notably different from the quarterly figures Apple would later report.
Near-term expectations for PC sales are already quite low, following Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q1 warning, AMD's Q2 warning, Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) June 25 results/guidance, and plenty of other negative news. Intel's Q2 report arrives on July 15.

Intel (INTC -1.6%) has gradually sold off after QLogic, whose Fibre Channel and Ethernet adapter cards and controllers go into plenty of servers powered by Intel Xeon CPUs, issued a major calendar Q2 sales warning.

Avago is also off, as are Mellanox/Brocade and IDT (IDTI -7.1%). IDT received 45% of its calendar Q1 revenue from HPC/data center chip sales.
QLogic blamed its warning on soft enterprise server/storage demand, along with high OEM inventories caused by a ""slower next-generation server transition in enterprise environments."" The latter is an apparent reference to Intel's Grantley (Xeon E5 V3) platform.
Of note: Some of the enterprise weakness seen by QLogic could be due to the rapid growth of the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market. Intel, of course, sells plenty of Xeon CPUs for both enterprise and IaaS server deployments.
Thanks in part to Grantley demand, Intel's server CPU division (DCG) revenue rose 19% Y/Y in Q1 to $3.68B, helping offset an 8% drop in PC/mobile CPU division (CCG) revenue to $7.42B. Q2 results arrive on July 15.

9to5 Google reports the first commercial Google Glass (NASDAQ:GOOG) model features ""a larger prism display, as well as an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Atom processor that brings better performance and moderately improved battery life."" Connectivity is provided via Bluetooth and dual-band Wi-Fi.
The site adds Google is internally referring to the Glass model as Enterprise Edition. Many businesses and institutions have come up with potential uses for Glass, even as consumer attitudes towards the product remain quite mixed, thanks in large part to the privacy concerns caused by its camera.
Still no word on the model's pricing or official launch date. It's expected to be much cheaper than the $1,500 charged for the Explorer edition of Glass, which Google stopped selling earlier this year.
A larger display could provide an ASP boost for Glass microdisplay supplier Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX). The WSJ reported last fall Intel would provide the CPU for a next-gen Glass model.

693,Intel gains after management shakeup; Citi offers positive reaction,"Jul. 2, 2015, 6:40 PM","

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1.2% today following news president Renee James and 3 other execs will be leaving soon as part of a management shakeup.
In an employee memo (.pdf), CEO Brian Krzanich stated Intel's Technology & Manufacturing Group and HR ops (previously reporting to James) will now directly report to him. The rest of James' direct reports will ""transition to other organizations."" Intel's PC, mobile, and server chip units began directly reporting to Krzanich back in 2013. Since then, Intel's PC CPU and Atom mobile CPU units have been merged.
Discussing the moves in general, Krzanich says they aim to ""continue [Intel's] drive for velocity and streamlined decision-making."" Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants have carried out big shakeups in recent years with similar goals in mind.

Bloomberg reports James ""doesn’t have a new job lined up and is leaving to carry out the search."" Citi's Chris Danely considers James' departure a positive given ""the lack of growth and low profitability of [Intel's] software business"" under her leadership.
Danely: ""We believe Renee James was largely responsible for spearheading Intel’s confusing $7.7 billion acquisition of McAfee in 2011. The McAfee deal has been a major disappointment in our view as there are virtually no synergies between Intel’s core silicon business and McAfee security software. When Intel acquired [McAfee] it generated 2010 revenue of $2.1 billion with operating margins of roughly 11%. We estimate McAfee revenues have remained roughly flat since the company was acquired, while operating margins have declined to the mid-single digit range.""

James has been Intel's second in-command behind CEO Brian Krzanich, and became responsible for overseeing manufacturing, software, security tech, and corporate strategy/planning as part of a 2013 reorg. She'll stay until January to help ""transition the Executive Office.""
Three other execs are also leaving: Arvind Sodhani, the head of Intel Capital (the company's VC arm) and a 35-year vet; Hermann Eul, until last fall the head of Intel's mobile processor ops; and Mike Bell, previously in charge of a Devices unit responsible for wearables. M&A chief Wendell Brooks will take over Sodhani's responsibilities.
Also: 1) Intel's Security unit (formerly McAfee) has been formally integrated with the rest of the company. 2) Communications & Devices Group GM Aicha Evans is joining the management committee. 3) Josh Walden, the GM of Intel's New Technology Group, now ""leads all product and research teams that create and deploy new technology categories, such as interactive computing devices, perceptual computing and wearable devices.""

 Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is at the initial stage of reviewing whether to split itself in two or spin off a business, and has asked a consulting firm to help it review its options and draw up scenarios on how such a move might work, Reuters reports. One option said to be under consideration is separating AMD's graphics and licensing business from its server business; AMD had explored such a move in the past and  decided against it, but CEO Lisa Su, who took over last October, believes there is merit for AMD to at least consider such a possibility again, according to the report.

Intel (INTC +1.2%) has bought Recon Instruments, a Vancouver-based maker of heads-up displays for skiers, cyclists/joggers, and other fitness enthusiasts. Local site Techvibes reports the ""word on the street"" is that Intel paid ""upwards of $175 million.""
If Recon's name sounds familiar, it might be because Intel's VC arm made a big investment in the company in 2013. The chip giant now says Recon gives it ""a talented, experienced wearable computing team that will help us expand the market for head mounted display products and technologies.""
Historically, Intel's hardware efforts have been focused on creating reference designs and proof-of-concepts (see the MICA bracelet) meant to get OEMs to launch similar, Intel-powered, products. Nonetheless, Intel promises Recon will ""continue selling, enhancing and marketing their products under the Recon brand,"" while also (in-line with the historical efforts) ""[partnering] with Intel’s New Devices Group to develop smart device platforms for a broader set of customers and market segments.""
The purchase follows a 2014 partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica to create Intel-powered smartglasses, and reports the first commercial Google Glass model will contain an Intel processor.

Declaring May sales data from Taiwanese PC contract manufacturers (ODMs) was much weaker than expected, Goldman's James Covello (Sell, $23 target) has cut his 2015 Intel (INTC +0.3%) EPS estimate by $0.10 to $2.10 (below a $2.16 consensus).
Deutsche's Ross Seymore (Buy, $37 target) has cut his Q2, 2015, and 2016 estimates, stating PC sales remain weak and that a seasonal demand pickup aided by the launch of Windows 10 (due on July 29) and Intel's Skylake CPU platform (expected to begin rolling out in late summer) will come largely in Q4, rather than Q3.
Seymore also thinks channel inventory burn will hurt Intel's gross margin, and that the Altera deal will affect the pace of buybacks. However, he maintains ""INTC offers a favorable risk/reward at its current discount valuation and [expects] shares to appreciate as PC headwinds lessen (2H15/2016).""
RBC's Amit Daryanani recently estimated May ODM shipments were down 16% M/M to 9.6M, in sharp contrast to May 2014's 12% M/M growth. ""Given the larger than normal monthly declines thus far reported in 2015, we see risk to the downside for PC demand in June-qtr and CY15. Broadly barring a much stronger June, we think PC units could end up being down q/q in June-qtr.""
On the bright side (and echoing Deutsche), Daryanani thinks Q2 should ""mark a bottom for PC supply chain as we see Win 10 being a tailwind in 2HCY15 and we suspect the channel will start rebuilding inventory and provide relief as well."" In May, Intel's IR chief reportedly tried to temper hopes for an immediate Windows 10-driven PC rebound, while adding Intel does expect 2H15 inventory replenishment.

699,Intel drops on BMO downgrade; Computex product barrage arrives,"Jun. 2, 2015, 11:06 AM","

Skeptical of the wisdom of the Atlera acquisition, BMO's Ambrish Srivastava has downgraded Intel (INTC -2%) to Market Perform, and cut his target by $7 to $33.
Srivastava: ""We really do not see the opportunity/rationale that Intel is laying out for parting with ~$17 billion. Specifically, we do not concur with Intel's assumption of 7 percent CAGR for the business. Altera has grown at a negative CAGR of 2 percent in the midst of one of the more aggressive carrier CapEx builds we have seen.""
He also  wants more details about the deal. ""[W]e do not know ultimately how much debt Intel will end up issuing to finance the deal, potentially in the range of $7 billion to $12 billion, in the medium turn, it could lead to potentially reduced capital return via share repurchase...""
Others have been more positive. Deutsche's Ross Seymore predicts the deal will be 3% accretive to 2016 EPS, and expects co-packaged CPU/FPGA server and IoT products to arrive by 2H16. JPMorgan's Halrlan Sur predicts as many as 1/3 of cloud server workloads will rely on integrated CPU/FPGA SoCs by 2020, and forecasts FPGAs will fare well in the industrial/auto IoT chip space.
Meanwhile, as is its custom, Intel has unveiled a slew of new products at the Computex trade show. Among them: 14nm Broadwell desktop and notebook CPUs (Core i5 and i7) with integrated Iris Pro 6200 GPUs. Intel claims up to a 2x improvement in GPU performance relative to prior-gen Haswell parts to go with CPU performance and power improvements.
Also shown off: 1) Thunderbolt 3, a next-gen connector that works with USB Type-C ports; it delivers up to 40Gbps of bandwidth and 100W of power, and can be used by external GPUs, dual 4K monitors, and 10G Ethernet switches (among other things).  2) The Xeon E3-1200 v4 line, the first Xeon CPUs to sport Iris Pro GPUs. 3) A new reference design for Intel's IoT gateway family (previous) that adds more CPU and packaging options. 4) New Pentium/Celeron/Atom CPUs and OS options for IoT products.

Following more than two months of drama, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to announce tomorrow it's buying FPGA vendor Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) for the same $54/share price Bloomberg reported hearing in early April, per the WSJ.
The reported price translates to a $16.2B valuation (per Yahoo/Google Finance), or $13.2B after factoring net cash/investments. It represents an 11% premium to Altera's Friday close, and a 56% premium to where it traded before the WSJ first reported of deal talks on March 27.
Since the first reports, Altera has posted disappointing Q1 results/Q2 guidance, and Intel has announced a server CPU partnership with programmable ASIC maker eASIC (NYSEARCA:EASI) that has been seen as a hedge against Altera. But that alliance could prove complementary, as FPGAs remain the gold standard for rapid programmability and low design costs, while ASICs maintain a size, performance, and power edge.
Will Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) get acquired next? Reuters reported earlier this month Avago has shown interest in the Altera archrival. But that was before Avago struck a $37B deal to merge with Broadcom.

Slides leaked by a Chinese site Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to launch the first CPUs for its 14nm Skylake platform (successor to the current-gen/14nm Broadwell line) in August/September, and gradually flesh out its Skylake lineup over the following 4-5 months. Intel has said Skylake will launch in 2H15.
Desktop Skylake chips codenamed Skylake-S will reportedly arrive in August and September - with Intel skewing its Broadwell launches towards notebooks and tablets, some PC OEMs are opting to pass on launching desktop Broadwell parts and wait for Skylake.
Reportedly due in September: High-end notebook CPUs (Skylake-H), mainstream notebook CPUs (Skylake-U), and ultrabook/tablet CPUs (Skylake-Y). Additional Skylake-H parts are said to be due in October/November, and additional Skylake-U/Y parts in January.
Whereas Broadwell prioritized lowering power draw and enabling new form factors (see Apple's 12"" retina MacBook), Skylake appears to emphasize CPU/GPU performance gains as much as power savings. The PC industry is counting on Skylake and Windows 10 to spark a 2H15 rebound following a rough start to the year.
Separately, Digitimes reports Intel and Chinese mobile SoC partner Rockchip have stepped up their efforts to sell Rockchip's 3G Atom SoC (part of the SoFIA line, launched in March) to white-box Chinese tablet makers. As part of the effort, Intel is said to be offering a $3 subsidy for each device using the chip.
7"" tablets using the Rockchip SoC reportedly wholesale for just $45. With the help of generous marketing subsidies, Intel shipped 46M tablet CPUs last year, beating a goal of 40M.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is partnering with programmable ASIC maker eASIC (EASI - recently filed for an IPO) to create custom Xeon CPU products that (per the companies) can deliver up to 2x the performance acceleration of a solution using an FPGA for programmability. Web/cloud service providers (major buyers of custom Xeon parts) are targeted, as are security and big data/analytics workloads.
eASIC, whose customers include Seagate, Ericsson, and Huawei, argues ASICs designed by its clients deliver the programmability, development cost, and deployment time advantages of FPGAs (to a large extent, at least), while maintaining the size, unit cost, performance, and power draw advantages of standard ASICs. 60%-120% and 50%-80% performance and power advantages are respectively claimed over comparable FPGAs.
The alliance could act as a hedge against reported acquisition target Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), whom Intel has partnered with to create solutions that put a Xeon CPU and Altera FPGA in the same package. Web/cloud providers looking to use FPGAs to accelerate processing for algorithms they've developed are among the intended clients. FPGAs can still deliver a level of on-the-fly programmability that eASIC's offerings can't.
For those interested, eASIC filed its latest IPO prospectus last week. The company had 2014 revenue of $67.4M (+126% Y/Y), and a net loss of $1.1M. As of March 31, eASIC had enabled over 200 custom IC designs and shipped over 21M chips.

AMD has guided (.pdf) at its 2015 analyst day for 2H15 revenue to rise 15% (+/- 3%) from an expected 1H15 level of ~$2B. That implies full-year revenue of ~$4.3B, close to a $4.28B consensus.
Gross margin is expected to be in a ~32%-34% range in 2H15 after amounting to ~32% in 1H15, and operating expenses are expected to fall to ~$680M-$700M from ~$715M. Free cash flow is expected to be negative in 1H15, and positive in 2H15.

Long-term targets: 36%-40% GM, over $0.50/year in EPS, double-digit revenue growth from AMD's server CPU, embedded processor, and pro GPU ops, mid-single digit growth from its semi-custom (inc. console APU) and other GPU ops, and flat to down PC CPU revenue. AMD plans to use any cash in excess of $1B to retire debt (it had $906M at the end of Q1).
AMD has also officially unveiled its 7000 Series notebook CPUs (codenamed Carrizo). The cheapest version has two 1.5GHz. cores, and a 10W max power draw.; the most powerful version had four 2.5GHz. cores, a 12-25W max power draw, and a Radeon R5 GPU. Also announced: A set of new mainstream desktop and notebook GPUs (the Radeon 300 series), and price cuts for A-series desktop CPUs (prices now range from $42-$127).
In Q2, AMD plans to launch its first GPU to support High Bandwidth Memory (HBM); performance/watt is said to be over 3x greater than current-gen GDDR5 memory. In 2016, it plans to launch GPUs that support HBM and use a FinFET (3D transistor) process; TSMC's 16nm process is a possibility. AMD is counting on the GPUs to reverse share losses to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Also launching in 2016: Zen, a next-gen CPU core said to handle 40% more instructions per clock cycle and feature a high-bandwidth/low-latency cache system. Samsung/GlobalFoundries' 14nm process is expected to be used; that would narrow Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) manufacturing process edge, given Intel is currently at 14nm (10nm next year) and AMD at 28nm. Earlier today, SA author Alex Cho took a look at AMD's leaked 2016 Zen CPU roadmap.
On the ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) front, AMD is abandoning Project Skybridge, which sought to create ""ambidextrous"" platforms supporting either x86 or ARM CPUs. The timetable for the company's custom K12 ARM core has been pushed out from 2016 to 2017.

 Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new Xeon E7 v3 server CPU line follows the Sep. 2014 launch of the company's Xeon E5 v3 (Grantley) line. Whereas Grantley is aimed at smaller servers (1-4 CPUs) going into distributed HPC systems or hyperscale Web/cloud data centers, the E7 v3 line is aimed at high-end/mission-critical servers running up to 32 CPUs. Like Grantley, E7 CPUs are made using Intel's 22nm Haswell architecture and support up to 18 cores (the prior-gen E7 v2 supports up to 15) able to run two threads at a time. With an eye towards catering to memory-intensive analytics and in-memory database workloads (a rapidly growing market segment), the chips support up to 45MB of Level 3 cache and up to 1.5TB of DRAM per CPU socket (Intel claims this is an industry high). 17 OEMs, including HP, Dell, Cisco, Lenovo, and Oracle, plan to launch E7 v3 servers. Intel is counting on the CPUs to take further high-end share from RISC CPU lines such as Oracle's SPARC and IBM's Power. IBM is trying to drive a rebound in Power sales by licensing the platform to 3rd-party OEMs and CPU developers; its massive Power8 CPUs support up to 12 cores and 8 threads/core.

Arguably providing more ammo for those disgruntled shareholders pushing for an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) deal, Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) forecasts Q2 revenue will be down 4%-8% Q/Q. That implies a range of $400.6M-$418M, far below a $492.1M consensus.
Telecom/wireless revenue (-12% Y/Y, 42% of total revenue) was a soft spot in Q1. As was industrial automation, military, & automotive (21% of revenue -7%). Networking, computer, & storage (17% of revenue, +2%) and other products (20% of revenue, +7%) were healthier. FPGAs were 84% of revenue, and CPLDs 8%. Book-to-bill was below 1.
Shares have dropped to $40.45 AH, after having fallen 1.6% in regular trading in response to Xilinx's numbers, which were blamed to a large extent on soft mobile infrastructure demand. For those keeping score, Altera is now 26% below Intel's rumored $54/share offer price.

In addition to missing FQ4 revenue estimates (while beating on EPS), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is guiding for FQ1 revenue to be flat to down 4% Q/Q. That implies a range of $544.2M-$566.9M, below a $584.8M consensus.
Hurting FQ4 sales: Telecom/data center chip revenue (39% of total revenue) fell 7% Q/Q and 26% Y/Y; Texas Instruments just cited telecom infrastructure weakness (particularly for mobile gear) as a reason for its Q1 sales miss and soft Q2 guidance. Industrial, aerospace, & defense revenue (42% of total) fell 7% Q/Q (seasonality) but rose 13% Y/Y. Broadcast, consumer, & automotive (17% of total) rose 12% Q/Q and 6% Y/Y.
Helping EPS beat estimates: Gross margin was 69.9%, up 230 bps Y/Y and above guidance of 68%-69%. FQ1 GM guidance is at 69%-70%. Also boosting EPS: $175M was spent on buybacks, even with FQ3.
Xilinx has fallen to $42.89 AH. Archrival Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), which reportedly rejected a $54/share Intel buyout offer, has dropped to $42.25 ahead of tomorrow's Q1 report. Piper downgraded Altera to Neutral earlier today, citing valuation.

717,ASML +12.4%; U.S. chipmaker (likely Intel) buying 15 EUV systems,"Apr. 22, 2015, 9:45 AM","


ASML has ""signed an agreement with one of its major US customers to deliver a minimum of 15 ASML EUV lithography systems to support increased development activity and pilot production of future-generation manufacturing processes.""
The first two systems (NXE:3350B units) will be delivered by year's end, complementing existing systems owned by the customer. The customer ""intends to use EUV lithography for multiple processing steps in future process technology nodes."" Financial terms are undisclosed.
The client is most likely Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which invested $4.1B in ASML in 2012 to bolster its EUV efforts but has been non-committal on when it will begin using EUV for commercial production. Intel stated last year it won't use EUV for 10nm chip production - its 10nm Cannonlake platform launches in 2016.
Today's announcement suggests Intel might use EUV for 7nm production; Intel has previously suggested it could even get to 7nm without EUV. TSMC has said it will use EUV at 7nm.

ING thinks the order will ""put pressure on other chip manufacturers, especially logic clients, to also consider bulking up orders for EUV."" It comes shortly after ASML struck a cautious tone about 10nm EUV adoption, but added R&D advances are making the technology more viable for 10nm pilot production.

720,"Intel +4.4%; RBC, Wedbush upgrade after earnings","Apr. 15, 2015, 1:29 PM","

RBC and Wedbush have upgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Outperform after the company slightly missed Q1 revenue estimates (while posting in-line EPS) thanks to weak PC sales, offered light sales guidance (as expected), cut its capex budget, and provided healthy gross margin and server CPU division (DCG) figures. Canaccord and Topeka have hiked their targets; Cowen, Deutsche, and Nomura have cut theirs.
RBC: ""Our upgrade is about double-digit [DCG] growth driving a 25% increase in cash flow over the next 2 years. It sees DCG revenue rising 13.2% in 2015 and 12.3% in 2016 - Intel has forecast a 15% CAGR through 2018 - and in doing so helping cash flow/share rise to $2.56 from 2014's $2.04.
Also: RBC (like others) thinks PC weakness is priced in, sees ""optionality"" in IoT, memory, and mobile chip growth. It thinks Intel's relatively light implied 2H15 gross margin guidance is due to the accounting treatment of inventory charges.
Wedbush notes Intel's light Q2 guidance is due to another quarter of PC CPU inventory drain, and argues this sets the stage for better 2H15 sales as Windows 10 and Intel's 14nm Skylake platform (the successor to Broadwell) launch. It also observes Intel expects mobile losses to drop by $800M in 2015 as contra revenue payments to OEMs subside.
Mentioned on the CC (transcript): 1) NAND flash sales (grouped within the ""Other"" segment) were up 14% Y/Y. 2) Desktop CPU volumes were down 16% (business weakness), while notebook volumes rose 3% and tablet volumes 45%. 3) Intel now expects a mid-single digit 2015 PC decline vs. prior guidance for flat growth. 4) Intel's cautious full-year GM forecast is attributed to 10nm startup costs (ramping in Q3/Q4) and declining 22nm utilization rates as 14nm production ramps.

 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had a Q1 gross margin of 60.5%, -540 bps Q/Q and +90 bps Y/Y, and slightly above a guidance midpoint of 60%. Q2 GM guidance is at 62% (+/- 2%); full-year GM guidance has been cut by 1% to 61% (+/- 2%).
Also: Intel has slashed its 2015 capex budget by $1.3B to $8.7B (+/- $500M). 2014 capex was $10.1B. In its CFO commentary (.pdf), Intel notes higher ASPs provided a 50 bps Q/Q GM boost in Q1, and are expected to provide a 150 bps Q2 boost; a mix shift towards server CPUs appears to be helping. Lower factory startup costs are expected to provide a 100 bps Q/Q Q2 boost, while lower platform volumes and higher platform unit costs will respectively provide 150 bps and 100 bps headwinds. Client Computing Group (CCG - PC/mobile processors) ASPs rose 1% Q/Q and fell 13% Y/Y in Q1 (mix shift towards Atom); unit volumes fell 18% Q/Q (seasonality and PC weakness) and rose 6% Y/Y. Data Center Group (DCG - server/networking CPUs) ASPs fell 3% Q/Q and rose 5% Y/Y; unit volumes fell 7% Q/Q and rose 15% Y/Y (the Grantley Xeon launch and Web/cloud demand).

Gartner estimates shipments fell 5.2% to 71.7M. With IDC also reporting of price pressure, revenue declines might be larger.
IDC: [T]he Q1 market faced multiple headwinds – including inventory build-up of Windows Bing based notebooks, commercial slow down following the [Windows] XP refresh and constrained demand in many regions due to currency fluctuations and unfavorable economic indicators.""  Gartner thinks sales of  ""mobile PCs"" (notebooks, convertibles, and Windows tablets) rose, while desktop sales fell sharply. ""PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality.""
Both Gartner and IDC report U.S. PC shipments fell only ~1% Y/Y. On the other hand, IDC thinks Japan (another high-ASP market) saw shipments fall 44%; strong Q1 2014 spending prior to a tax hike made for tough comps.
Market leaders Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) continued taking share from firms with less scale: IDC estimates Lenovo's share rose to 19.6% from 17.6% a year ago (3.4% unit growth), and HP's to 19% from 17.1% (3.3% unit growth).
#3 Dell's share rose to 13.5% from 13.4%; #4 Asus (OTC:ASUUY) was flat at 7.1%, and #5 Acer (OTC:ASIYF) rose to 7% from 6.3%. Everyone else collectively fell to 33.9% from 38.4%.

The roadmap for Intel's (INTC -0.1%) Atom x3 processor line (formerly codenamed SoFIA) is being expanded to cover IoT hardware, the chip giant announces on day 1 of the Chinese Intel Developer Forum (IDF). Developer kits will arrive later this year.
Like Atom x3 parts aimed at low-end Android devices (unveiled last month), the IoT chips will have integrated 3G or 4G modems. They'll complement Intel's tiny Quark CPUs (meant for less powerful IoT devices), as well as its button-sized Curie module (features a Quark CPU, among other things) and IoT Platform.
Intel also states it has begun shipping its 14nm Braswell low-end PC CPUs under the Pentium and Celeron brands. Braswell, the PC successor for the 22nm Bay Trail architecture, is available in dual and quad-core parts, and delivers improved graphics and power draw; CPU performance isn't expected to change much. Bay Trail's 14nm tablet successor (Cherry Trail) ships later this year.

Though Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) switches and routers often rely on home-grown ASICs, the company's new ""compute-integrated"" QFX5100-AA data center switch runs on an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon server CPU. Meanwhile, a complementary ""packet flow accelerator"" module features an Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) FPGA that can be programmed to run custom apps.

Juniper claims the switch and module, which are aimed at financial services firms demanding high throughput and low latency, can eliminate the need for a separate server to handle data processing, along with the related network hops. Private Maxeler Technologies provides a programming environment for the FPGA.
The switch and module begin shipping in Q3. Like Juniper's recently-launched QFX10000 data center spine switches, they take aim at fast-growing Arista (NYSE:ANET), whose low-latency switches have gained a strong following with HFT trading desks and other financial firms. Arista is no stranger to using x86 CPUs or Altera FPGAs in its hardware.

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Compute Stick (first unveiled at CES) is just slightly larger than a USB flash drive, and can turn any monitor/TV set with an HDMI port into a PC. Newegg has begun taking pre-orders for a $150 Windows 8.1 model, and a $110 Linux model; shipments begin on April 24.
Intel manages to cram a Z3735F Atom CPU (22nm, quad-core, up to 1.83GHz.), 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth radios, a USB port, and a micro USB port (for power) into the stick. The product arrives as Google and Asus get set to launch a sub-$100 Chrome OS PC stick.
Historically, Intel's goal with such hardware hasn't been to sell huge volumes, but to provide proof-of-concepts that compel OEMs to launch similar hardware (while using Intel silicon, of course). Aside from the Compute Stick, Intel has also launched a new mini PC (NUC) sporting a Core i7 CPU with Iris 6100 integrated graphics; it's expected to sell for ~$500.
Separately, Intel has detailed a new reporting structure that will be used in its April 14 Q1 report. Sales will be reported via 5 operating segments: A Client Computing Group (PC CPUs, mobile chips, connectivity chips); a Data Center Group (server CPUs, networking/storage processors); an Internet of Things Group (embedded CPUs); software/services (McAfee, other software, various services); and All other (flash memory, new devices, various corporate expenses).
The new structure allows Intel to avoid separately breaking out the top and bottom-line performance of its mobile chip ops, by merging them with those of its (very profitable) PC CPU ops. With tablet CPU marketing subsidies weighing on results, Intel's mobile chip reporting segment posted a $4.2B 2014 op. loss; losses are expected to narrow in 2015, but not evaporate.

Pitched as a cheaper alternative to the Surface Pro 3 (starts at $799, launched last May), Microsoft's (MSFT -0.6%) Surface 3 tablet starts at $499 and eschews the Pro 3's Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs in favor of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) less powerful/recently-launched Atom x7 (Cherry Trail). Its display is smaller (10.8"" vs. 12""), and resolution slightly lower (1920x1280 vs. 2160x1440). In what might be the final nail in the coffin for Windows RT, the tablet runs on Windows 8.1 (free upgrade to Windows 10 later this year).
The Surface 3 weighs just 1.37 lbs. and is only 0.34"" thick (the Pro 3 is at 1.76 lbs. and 0.37""), and goes without its costlier sibling's fan. The rear and front cameras respectively have 8MP and 3.5MP resolutions vs. 5MP apiece for the Pro 3. Other features - a kickstand, optional type cover accessories, a business-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio, stereo speakers with Dolby (DLB -0.2%) audio support - are similar.
Microsoft claims 10 hours of battery life when playing video. The Surface 3 begins shipping on May 5 (pre-orders start today); Verizon and T-Mobile will sell 4G-capable models later this year. To win over consumers, Microsoft is throwing in a free year of Office 365 Personal (normally $70/year).
Following a rough start in 2012/2013, the Surface line has gained a following among businesses and consumers wanting a tablet that can double as a PC/productivity device. Microsoft's Surface revenue rose 24% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $1.1B. IDC estimates Windows devices had a 5.1% 2014 tablet unit share via 11.6M shipments.

After rising 28.4% on Friday on reports Intel (INTC -0.3%) is in talks to buy the company, Altera (ALTR -3.8%) is paring its gains in response to downgrades from CLSA, Morgan Stanley, and Macquarie. Morgan Stanley has also downgraded Xilinx (XLNX +0.3%), which rose 5.8% on the reports.

Reactions to the reports, which vindicate at least a few predictions, have been largely positive. Among the perceived benefits to Intel from a deal: 1) Cost synergies from handling the manufacturing of Altera's FPGAs in-house. 2) Lowering Intel's PC dependence amid soft industry demand. 3) The potential to better cater to the likes of Facebook and Google (and keep ARM rivals at bay) by creating Xeon server CPUs with built-in FPGA circuitry to accelerate algorithm performance. 4) The potential to create system-level solutions for servers, telecom infrastructure gear, and other products that combine processors, FPGAs, and other chips.
CLSA: ""[W]e view a potential Altera deal favorably given the manufacturing and end-market synergies ... Altera’s strong base station presence is valuable to Intel ... we see $0.05-0.10 accretion to our 2016 EPS, and additional accretion down the road as manufacturing moves in house.""

Cowen: ""[W]e surmise the deal would be heavily debt financed ... ALTR is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margin than INTC ... PLDs are one of the only verticals requiring leading-edge silicon in which INTC does not compete.""
Though upgrading Altera to Market Perform, Wiliam Blair is more cautious. ""[W]e believe Altera’s fundamentals have deteriorated as the company has faced multiple headwinds. These include market share loss to Xilinx, declining margins, delays in new product ramp-ups, and competitive issues ... On top of this, we believe Altera (as well as Xilinx) has been negatively affected by the increased adoption of SoC solutions, resulting in decreased demand for FPGAs for Glue Logic functions."" Bernstein (still bearish on Intel) notes Altera's revenue is only equal to 3% of Intel's.
If a deal happens, many think Xilinx will be acquired soon afterwards. The short list of chipmakers big enough to swallow Xilinx ($11.1B market cap) and arguably having complementary products includes Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Analog Devices, NXP/Freescale (about to merge), Skyworks, and Avago. There's also some speculation Intel, which has sat out the chip industry's recent M&A wave, will follow up on an Altera deal by making other purchases to lower its PC exposure.

The offerings take aim at Samsung, which has been shipping 3D NAND parts for several months, as well as Toshiba and partner SanDisk (SNDK - fell 18.5% today due to a Q1/2015 warning). Today, Toshiba/SanDisk announced a 48-layer 128Gb 3G NAND solution - the Intel/Micron solution features 32 layers, as do Samsung's current chips. The SanDisk/Toshiba offering relies on an advanced 15nm manufacturing process and is sampling today, but full commercial production isn't expected until 2016.
Needham's Rajvindra Gill (Strong Buy on Micron) is pleased with today's news. ""We think MU’s strategy of optimizing bits per area is the right approach in 3D NAND."" At the same time, he notes Samsung's 3D offerings deliver major endurance, performance, and power benefits relative to 2D NAND.
In other Intel-related news, the WSJ reports HP is close to selling a 51% stake in its H3C Chinese networking hardware unit to Tsinghua Unigroup. With Intel taking a 20% stake in Tsinghua last year as part of a mobile processor alliance, a deal could lead to greater use of Intel's CPUs, network processors, and switching chips within H3C's hardware.
Intel doesn't separately break out its NAND sales. The business is part of an ""All other"" reporting segment that had 2014 revenue of $2.25B (+18% Y/Y). After initially falling due to SanDisk's warning, Micron closed up 0.3% today. Intel closed up 0.6%.

Update: AnandTech estimates the Intel/Micron solution has an array efficiency (the % of the die that's dedicated to memory cells) of 85%, above the 66% and 72% respectively estimated for MLC and TLC Samsung chips. ""I now understand why Intel-Micron claim that their 3D NAND technology comes with disruptive cost because it really is the most efficient 3D NAND technology we have seen so far.""

736,Intel scores Tag Heuer watch design win; IBM OpenPower servers arrive,"Mar. 19, 2015, 10:05 AM","

With Apple Watch set to ship next month, leading high-end Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer plans to launch a watch that runs on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear platform, and is powered by an Intel (INTC +0.1%) CPU.
The PR provides few details about the watch, but Reuters reports the product will be a version of Tag's bestselling Carrera line, and launch next autumn. With Carerra watches often priced above $2K, the deal will likely be more valuable to Intel as a reference win - the vast majority of early smartwatch launches have involved ARM-based CPUs - than as a revenue-generator.
Intel is going after the wearables market by pitching its Atom CPUs for relatively powerful devices, and its tiny Quark CPUs for less resource-hungry products where battery life is a priority. It has also launched Curie, a button-sized module containing a Quark CPU, flash memory, Bluetooth radio, and sensor hub. The company has a partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica, and has reportedly landed a design win for the next version of Google Glass.
Separately, IBM (IBM +0.2%) has announced the first OpenPower servers - servers running on IBM's Power CPUs (compete against Intel's Xeon line), but which can be made by 3rd-party OEMs and could sell for much less than IBM's Power-based servers historically have - will launch in Q2 and be sold by Taiwanese manufacturer Tyan. IBM plans to offer its own OpenPower servers later this year in partnership with Taiwan's Wistron; they'll be aimed at the high-performance computing (HPC) market.
Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, and Rackspace are among the companies that have given their support to OpenPower. IBM is both hoping to halt Power's long-term share losses to Intel, and grab a bigger share of an Internet/white-box server market (dominated by Intel systems) that accounts for a large and growing portion of global server spend.

Canaccord's Matt Ramsay has upgraded Intel (INTC -0.6%) to Buy a day after the company issued a Q1 warning blamed on weak business PC sales and lower-than-expected customer inventories. CLSA has also upgraded, albeit only to Underperform from Sell.
Ramsay: ""[W]e believe the removal of unrealistic PC expectations actually makes Intel shares more investible and the Win10/Skylake refreshes during 2H/15 could even provide modest upside to lower expectations ... We believe 15%+ [server CPU division] and 20%+ [IoT chip division] growth expectations are quite achievable for the next several years, growing non-PC sales to >50% of Intel’s revenue by 2017...""
Intel's mobile division (MCG) performance is also expected to improve, though Ramsay considers an iPhone baseband win unlikely. ""With lower platform costs and gradual LTE and SoFIA revenue ramps, we anticipate lower losses in MCG in 2015 and materially lower losses in 2016. We believe LTE connectivity in PCs could emerge as an underappreciated LTE modem driver...""

Others on the Street have reacted more cautiously, with several analysts noting Intel's forecast is backed up by negative Asian supply chain data. Susquehanna's Chris Caso thinks the euro's weakness - it's selling off again today - is playing a big role. ""Since PC component costs are all in dollars (and are priced accordingly in Euros), the exceptional Euro weakness has caused PC prices to rise dramatically in Europe.""
Meanwhile, though the warning has grabbed far more headlines, Intel has been busy this week refreshing its server CPU lineup. The company has launched Xeon D, an SoC that's based on the 14nm Broadwell architecture, sports a built-in memory controller and two 10-gig Ethernet links, and is aimed at Web servers and storage/networking hardware. Facebook's Open Compute Project has unveiled an open-source server design that relies on Xeon D.

VentureBeat reports Intel's (INTC +3.7%) recently-announced XMM 7360 4G baseband modem (made by its Infineon unit) will go into 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, thus partly taking a slot reserved for several years by Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.9%) Gobi modems.
The site adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers ""have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone,"" and that Intel ""has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones."" Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm.
The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation. Qualcomm, which still claims the lion's share of the 4G baseband market, announced a Cat-10 LTE modem (the Gobi 9x45) last November that was declared to offer better power consumption and take up less board space than the prior-gen/Cat-6 9x35.
Apple sold 193M iPhones last year, and will likely top 200M this year. As is the case with many other clients, Qualcomm's modem sales to Apple help enable the sale of several complementary parts - an RF transceiver, a power management IC, a receive-only chip, and an envelope-tracking IC that lowers power draw.
Intel is up sharply today after selling off hard yesterday amid a market rout. The chip giant has already seen 18.2M shares traded vs.a 3-month daily average of 29M.

 With Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Grantley Xeon CPU launch and Web data center investments offsetting weak high-end server demand, IDC estimates global server revenue rose 1.9% Y/Y in Q4 to $14.5B, and Gartner estimates it rose 2.2% to $14B; those figures compares with Q3 growth estimates of 4.8% and 1.7%, respectively.
Likewise, IDC estimates global enterprise storage revenue rose 7.2% Y/Y in Q4, aided by Web investments and healthy demand for mid-range systems featuring integrated flash. Q3 growth was pegged at 5.1%.

IBM had a rough time its both the server and storage markets: IDC believes its storage share fell to 9% (tied for #3) from 12.7% a year earlier, and Gartner estimates its server revenue fell 14% if one excludes Big Blue's x86 server unit, which was just sold to Lenovo. After accounting for the x86 sale, IDC estimates IBM's server share was at 13.7% (#3) vs. 26.8% a year ago.
HP (NYSE:HPQ) fared a little better: IDC has its server share falling fractionally to 26.8% (still #1 overall), and its storage share falling to 13.8% (#2)  from 14.1%. The company's x86 server unit has been gaining ground against IBM's former business, but its high-end server sales remain weak.
Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) UCS server line (recently refreshed) continues to gain ground: Its share rose to 5.3% (#5)  from 4.5%, with full-year revenue pegged at $2.9B. With the help of aggressive pricing and x86 growth, Dell's server share rose to 16.7% (#2) from 15.2%, while its storage share slipped to 9% (tied for #3) from 9.2%. Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) claimed a 7.6% server share (#4) thanks to the IBM deal, kicking Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) out of the top-5 along the way.
EMC, whose high-end storage sales have been pressured (mid-range/flash demand has been better), saw its storage share drop to 22.2% (still #1) from 23.1%. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), which posted an FQ3 miss and light guidance last month amid tough mid-range competition from EMC and others, saw its share drop to 7.2% (#5) from 8%.
Not surprisingly, the white-label hardware beloved by Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. continued to take share. IDC estimates such hardware, referred to as ODM Direct, claimed server and storage shares of 8.2% and 12.8% vs. 6.4% and 9.9% a year ago.
Sales of x86 servers, the lion's share of which run on Intel CPUs, rose 7.1% to $11.5B. Sales of non-x86 servers fell 14% to $3B, thanks to declining demand for both mainframes and UNIX servers running proprietary RISC CPUs.

CPU and 3G modem, another (made by partner Rockchip) a quad-core, 1.2GHz. CPU and 3G modem, and a third a quad-core 1.4GHz. CPU and 4G modem. Notably, SoFIA uses ARM's (NASDAQ:ARMH) Mali GPU cores, and relies on an older 28nm manufacturing process.
Also officially launched: Cherry Trail, the 14nm successor to the 22nm Bay Trail line as Intel's entry for the tablet and small-screen convertible market, and whose processors will be sold under the Atom x5 and x7 monikers.
Relatively few details were provided about x5/x7 parts, which leads AnandTech to suspect they're aimed at late 1H15 and 2H15 products. Intel does note x5/x7 processors will sport powerful Gen 8 GPUs, and (as rumored) the company's next-gen Airmont CPU core.
The XMM 7360, the latest entry for Intel's standalone baseband modem line, supports Cat-10 LTE (peak speeds of 450Mbps). The prior-gen XMM 7260 topped out at Cat-6 (peak speeds of 300Mbps); Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) unveiled a Cat-10 modem last November.
Other announcements: 1) Intel's McAfee unit's VirusScan Mobile software will be pre-installed on Samsung's Galaxy S6, and McAfee's Mobile Security software will be bundled with an LG smartwatch; a pre-install deal already exists for LG smartphones. 2) Intel is partnering with Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, and Huawei on creating a variety of network management and radio network hardware running on (Intel-powered) servers.
Intel is hoping the efforts will bolster a mobile chip division that (thanks in large part to marketing subsidies) posted a $1.1B op. loss in Q4, and a $4.2B op. loss for 2014. Nomura and Wells Fargo are optimistic SoFIA can provide a lift.

The WSJ previously reported of a $350M deal price, while adding the final tab could be $375M if certain conditions are met.
According to the WSJ's sources, Annapurna is developing ""midrange networking chips for data centers, offering improvements over existing products in terms of information-transmission rates and power consumption."" Israel's Calcalist reports the company is developing ""microprocessors that allow fast data traffic for low-power computing servers and storage servers.""  It also notes CPU core giant ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) is an investor.
AWS' data centers contain hundreds of thousands of servers running Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 CPUs. Though Amazon has downplayed the efforts of 3rd-party ARM server CPU vendors, it has also hired several key engineers from defunct ARM CPU vendor Calxeda, a move that has fueled speculation Amazon is prepping its own ARM server chips. Annapurna could assist with the effort.
The news comes on a day in which Piper has assigned AWS a ~$32B valuation.

756,"Xilinx -6.1% on revenue miss, guidance; Altera -3.1%","Jan. 21, 2015, 5:31 PM","

On top of missing FQ3 revenue estimates (while beating slightly on EPS), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is guiding for FQ4 revenue to be down 2%-6% Q/Q. That implies a range of $557.9M-$581.6M, well below a $635.4M consensus.
The FPGA vendor blames its FQ3 revenue miss on weak broadcast and telecom market sales. Many chipmakers and optical component vendors have seen telecom-related sells pressured by soft industry capex.
Gross margin was 69.7%, -220 bps Q/Q but +50 bps Y/Y and above guidance of 69%. That contributed to the EPS beat, as did $175M worth of buybacks. GAAP opex rose 10% Y/Y to $223.9M, exceeding revenue growth of 1%.

Segment performance: Telecom & data center revenue (41% of total) -7% Y/Y. Industrial, aerospace, & defense (43% of revenue) +18%. Broadcast, consumer, and automotive (14% of revenue) -9%. Everything else (2% of revenue) -39%. 28nm chip sales rose nearly 20% Q/Q.
Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) is following Xilinx lower. Its Q4 report arrives tomorrow afternoon.

759,"Intel off slightly as bulls trumpet servers, capex; AMD falls","Jan. 16, 2015, 12:43 PM","

Intel (INTC -0.4%) is off fractionally after providing in-line revenue guidance and a soft gross margin forecast to go with a Q4 beat. Charter Equity has downgraded to Market Perform, and Stifel (Buy) has upped its target by $2 to $41.
Not surprisingly, bulls are focusing heavily on the 25% Y/Y growth posted by Intel's server CPU unit (DCG). Jefferies: ""To say DCG is a hidden gem is an understatement ... all four segments (Enterprise, Cloud, High-Performance Computing, Networking) posted growth. We think Intel’s new server cycle (Grantley) helps in 2015, but view drivers in DCG to be largely secular.""
Also going over well: Intel's 2014 capex ($10.1B) was below prior guidance of $10.5B-$11.5B, and its 2015 guidance midpoint is only at $10B. Wells Fargo observes the 2014/2015 figures are below 2011-2013 levels of $10.7B-$11B, even though ""2015 revenue that is likely to be substantially higher than in any of these years.""
Those less positive often highlight slowing PC CPU growth. Ascendiant Capital thinks Q4 PC CPU division revenue ($8.9B, +3%) fell short of a $9.2B consensus. ""It looks as though the upgrade cycle is tapering off and we expect a return of a secular declining PC market in 2015."" Bernstein, reiterating inventory concerns: ""Intel’s [PC] unit shipments still remain well above market data on a YoY basis, and account receivable DSOs increased sharply.""
Intel has guided for PC division sales to fall by a low-single digit % in 2015, following a strong 2014 boosted by an inventory refresh and share gains against AMD (AMD -4.2%). AMD, which reports on Jan. 20, is selling off today.
On the CC (transcript) CEO Brian Krzanich stated Intel shipped 46M tablet CPUs in 2014, beating a goal of 40M, and that the company is committed to driving out $800M in mobile chip unit costs in 2015. Thanks in large part to heavy marketing subsidies, the unit posted a $4.2B 2014 op. loss.

Arguing Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) manufacturing process lead threatens Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.5%) mobile processor share, Drexel Hamilton's Rick Whittington has downgraded the mobile chip/IP giant to Hold, and cut his target by $25 to $75.
Whittington observes Intel is now selling 14nm processors - its 14nm Cherry Trail tablet CPUs recently began shipping - while Qualcomm has just begun selling 20nm processors (made by TSMC). He adds top foundries are slow to ramp 14nm and 16nm FinFET processes - Samsung/Globalfoundries are rolling out the former, TSMC the latter - and that Intel ""also appears set on commoditizing low-mid-range LTE [baseband modems] for incorporation in their mobile processor offerings, conjuring a price war.""
Worth noting: 1) While Intel has begun offering powerful app processors that leverage advanced manufacturing processes, it hasn't launched high-end baseband/app processors that can take on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 series. 2) A large portion of Intel's low-end efforts - both for app processors and baseband/app processors - are tied to alliances with Chinese chipmakers who (like Qualcomm) rely on 3rd-party foundries.
Qualcomm is off modestly following the downgrade. FQ1 results arrive on Jan. 28.

761,Intel's gross margin outlook light; server CPU sales jump,"Jan. 15, 2015, 4:33 PM","

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had a Q4 gross margin of 65.4%, +40 bps Q/Q and +340 bps Y/Y,  above a guidance midpoint of 64%, and contributing heavily to its EPS beat. However, GM is expected to fall to 60% (+/- 2%) in seasonally weak Q1, and 2015 GM guidance of 62% (+/- 2%) is mostly below a 2014 figure of 63.7%.
In its CFO commentary (.pdf), Intel states higher platform unit costs and higher factory start-up costs will respectively have 200 bps and 150 bps Q1 impacts on GM relative to Q4. Lower platform volumes will have a 100 bps impact, and higher platform write-offs (mostly related to the next-gen Skylake platform) a 50 bps impact.

PC CPU division performance: Revenue +3% Y/Y to $8.9B. Volumes +6%, ASPs -2% (mix shift to Atom). Desktop volumes +1%, ASPs flat. Notebook volumes +11%, ASPs -3%. Op. profit +18% $3.98B.

Server CPU division performance: Revenue +25% to $4.1B (boosted by the Grantley launch and cloud demand). Volumes +15%, ASPs +10%. Op. profit +39% to $2.23B.

With marketing subsidies to OEMs still taking a toll, the mobile chip division posted a $1.11B op. loss on official revenue of -$6M. The IoT Group had revenue of $591M (+10%), and a $185M op. profit. Software/services had revenue of $557M (-6%), and a $25M op. profit. Everything else produced revenue of $617M (+23%), and had an op. loss of $856M (includes one-time costs).
$4B was spent on buybacks vs. $4.2B in Q3. R&D/MG&A spend rose 4% Y/Y to $5B.
The 2015 capex budget is at $10B (+/- $500M). At the time of the Q3 report, the 2014 budget was $11B (+/- $500M).

764,PC sales better than expected; Apple's share tops 7%,"Jan. 12, 2015, 5:58 PM","


IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 2.4% Y/Y in Q4 to 80.8M - a bigger decline than Q3 and Q2's 1.7%, but better than expectations for a 4.8% drop. Gartner is more positive, estimating shipments rose 1% to 83.7M.
Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win. XP support) has slowed, and that ""market progress has been fueled by low-priced systems, including growth of Chromebooks and [Microsoft's] promotion of Windows 8 + Bing.""
On the bright side, both IDC and Gartner report Asia-Pac returned to positive growth, and that broader consumer demand is gradually improving. The U.S. consumer market is expected to return to positive growth in 2015, aided by slowing tablet demand and the Windows 10 launch.
IDC believes all top-5 vendors gained share from rivals with less scale. A quarter after cracking the top-5 for the first time with a 6.3% share, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) unit share is believed to have risen to 7.1% (+130 bps Y/Y) on the back of 4.9M shipments (+18.9%). Given higher ASPs, revenue share might be around 15%.
Market leader Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose 140 bps to 19.9%; #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) rose 300 bps to 19.7%; #3 Dell's rose 140 bps to 13.5%; #4 Acer's (OTC:ASIYF) rose 40 bps to 7.7%. Non-top 5 firms saw their share drop 740 bps to 32.2%, with their shipments declining 20.7%.

766,"Intel launches Broadwell-U CPUs, receives MKM upgrade","Jan. 5, 2015, 12:17 PM","

Four months after launching its first 14nm Broadwell CPUs - the ultrabook/tablet-focused Core M line, also known as Broadwell-Y - Intel (INTC -0.5%) has rolled out over a dozen CPUs based on its Broadwell-U architecture, which targets mainstream notebooks and smaller desktops. Plenty of products featuring the chips should be shown off at CES.
The dual-core CPUs will be sold under the Celeron, Pentium, and Core i3/i5/i7 labels, and (naturally) come with integrated GPUs. Most have an official max power draw (TDP) of 15W, but a handful have 28W TDPs and also come with relatively powerful Iris 6100 GPUs. The Core M line can deliver sub-5W TDPs.

Intel claims a Core i7 Broadwell-U CPU can respectively deliver 22% and 50% increases in 3D graphics and video conversion performance over a comparable 22nm Haswell CPU, and (perhaps more notably) up to a 1.5-hour increase in battery life. Quad-core Broadwell parts aimed at tower desktops and high-end notebooks aren't expected until mid-2015.
Rival AMD's (AMD -1.1%) most advanced PC CPU lines still rely on 28nm processes; the company has promised 20nm parts will arrive later this year.
The launch comes as MKM makes a belated upgrade to Buy, and hikes its target by $5 to $45. ""We likely kept our neutral rating (with positive bias) for too long as PCs stabilized, data center improved, and INTC demonstrated a flexible approach to succeed in tablets and access existing China consumer channels.""
MKM is also upbeat about server CPU demand, given new product cycles and strong cloud and big data-related demand. Intel has forecast its server CPU division sales will rise at a 15% annual clip through 2018. PC CPU division sales are expected to fall slightly in 2015, following a strong 2014.
Also: Intel has bought a 30% stake in smart glasses maker Vuzix for $24.8M. The investment follows an alliance with eyewear giant Luxottica, and a WSJ report that the next version of Google Glass will sport an Intel CPU.

French carrier Iliad's (OTCPK:ILIAF) Online.net unit plans to launch a cloud infrastructure service next month that runs on servers featuring ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) CPUs supplied by Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL). Making good on ARM's promise of high densities, 18 servers - each sporting one quad-core CPU - can fit onto a blade, and 16 blades can fit within a chassis.
Though it's no Google or Amazon, Iliad provides a useful reference win for ARM server CPU vendors as they try to take share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), whose Xeon CPUs claim the lion's share of the server market, including most Web/cloud data center deployments.
Canaccord has forecast ARM server CPUs, still in their infancy, will grab a 20% share by 2018. Hyperscale data centers and application-specific server appliances are seen as areas where ARM-based solutions could stand out.
Intel is looking to head off the ARM threat both by developing low-power Atom server CPUs, maintaining a manufacturing process edge, and (notably) providing a variety of custom CPUs to Internet giants such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and eBay; the latest offerings are packaged with Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) FPGAs to provide on-the-fly programmability.
Nonetheless, Facebook's Open Compute Project supports both ARM and x86 CPUs, and Google has been reported to be thinking of building its own ARM chip. An Amazon VP recently stated ARM vendors aren't keeping pace with Intel. But Amazon might simply be opting to create its own ARM designs, given it has hired several key engineers from defunct ARM vendor Calxeda.
Cavium (CAVM) and AppliedMicro (NASDAQ:AMCC) are often viewed as ARM server CPU plays. AMD, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are also competing in this space.

The Intel IoT Platform (NASDAQ:INTC), launched today, aims to provide a ""reference model"" for Web-connected embedded devices (the proverbial Internet of Things), along with related software and services.
The solution includes: 1) An updated version of the Intel IoT Gateway (launched last year), which provides Web connectivity and data sharing for embedded devices. The gateways will be offered by 20 ODMs by early 2015. 2) Management software from Intel's Wind River (embedded software) unit. 3) Security tools from McAfee. 4) An API and traffic management tools for developers (enabled by the Mashery acquisition).
Intel is also partnering with Dell, Accenture, SAP, Wipro, and others to create solutions that ""provide a repeatable foundation"" for the IoT Platform that developers can build customer-specific solutions on top of.
The chip giant's main goal, of course, is to drive CPU sales - partly for gateways, but primarily for the devices they interact with. Intel offers Atom CPUs for more powerful embedded devices, and Quark CPUs for smaller, low-power products.
The Intel IoT Platform will face off against ARM's (NASDAQ:ARMH) mbed IoT platform (launched in October).

Calling the company's guidance for mid-single digit 2015 revenue growth ""optimistic,"" CLSA's Srini Pajjuri downgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Sell today in the wake of its investor day.
Pajjuri: ""Intel’s PC segment volumes are on track to grow 9% in 2014, compared to our PC unit forecast of -2%. We believe share gains explain ~3 points of the discrepancy, which means that the remaining 8 points of difference is largely due to inventory build at customers."" He expects Intel's PC CPU revenue to fall 6% in 2015 vs. guidance for a slight decline.
Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon, who downgraded two weeks ago, also remains concerned about PC CPU inventories. In addition, he thinks Intel's mobile ops ""[remain] a horror show.""
Bulls, meanwhile, are taking heart in Intel's forecast for server CPU division (DCG) revenue to grow at a 15% annual clip through 2018. Jefferies' Mark Lipacis: ""We think DCG growth alone could add $1 billion to 2015 FCF and $0.15-$0.20 to EPS. We forecast FCF to increase by 30%-40% to $13 billion in 2015.""
Pac Crest's Mike McConnell notes the DCG outlook implies 20%+ Y/Y growth in non-traditional enterprise segments (Web/cloud, HPC, networking) and high-single digit growth elsewhere. ""We believe improving U.S. GDP growth, coupled with Microsoft’s planned expiration of [Windows Server 2003 support] in July, is driving Intel’s more constructive outlook for demand from its traditional enterprise customer base next year.”
The PC division had $4.1B in Q3 op. profit, and DCG $1.9B. Intel's outlook suggests the company isn't too concerned for now about ARM server CPUs; Qualcomm threw its hat into the ARM server ring on Wednesday.

PC group chief Kirk Skaugen will run the merged unit, to be known as the Client Computing Group. A new position for mobile group chief Herman Eul will be announced at the end of Q1 2015.
The WSJ states the portion of the mobile unit responsible for modem development - this presumably includes baseband chips, and perhaps also Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS chips - will be placed in a separate wireless platform R&D group.
Spokesman Chuck Mulloy: ""The lines are blurring between PCs, tablets, phablets and phones. The idea is to accelerate the implementation and create some efficiency so that we can move even faster.” The creation of platforms such as Cherry Trail and Core M arguably backs up Mulloy's claim about blurred lines.
At the same time, the shakeup could help Intel mask the losses produced by its mobile processor ops. While the PC unit had a Q3 op. profit of $4.1B, the mobile unit had a $1.04B op. loss, thanks in part to contra revenue (marketing subsidy) payments to tablet OEMs. Intel forecasts mobile losses will narrow next year as contra payments drop, but doesn't expect the business to turn profitable.

Intel began shipping its low-power Quark CPUs this year, and has also developed Atom CPUs meant for embedded devices.
Meanwhile, Intel has shared more details Knights Landing, an upcoming 14nm product for its Xeon Phi co-processor line (used in HPC/supercomputer systems), and added Knights Hill, a successor product that will use a 10nm process, to its roadmap.
Knights Landing, which succeeds the current Knights Corner in 2H15, is said to deliver a 3x improvement in single-thread performance. It includes up to 16GB of memory, can work either as a co-processor or a standalone processor, and relies on a new interconnect fabric (called Omni-Path) that Intel promises will deliver better performance and require fewer switches than the widely-used InfiniBand - that makes it a potential challenge for Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX).
The product takes aim at Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) leading position in the HPC co-processor market. Today, Nvidia unveiled the Tesla K80, a high-end HPC co-processor said to deliver 8.7 teraflops of single-precision throughput (74% above the prior-gen K40). The K80 sells for $5,000, and contains two of Nvidia's new (28nm) GK210 GPUs.

That didn't last long: Four months after Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon upgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Market Perform (after holding a bearish stance for over 18 months), he has downgraded the chip giant back to Underperform.
Much like a few other analysts, Rasgon is concerned Intel's above-market PC CPU growth is driven not only by share gains against AMD - he declares Intel is ""absolutely slaughtering"" its smaller rival - but also by rising channel inventories. Last week, Intersil's guidance and commentary heightened inventory-related concerns.
Rasgon: ""Inventory builds in the 1H are normally followed by channel inventory drains in the 2H ... Far from draining channel inventory in 2H14, Intel’s Q3 results and implied Q4 outlook suggest channel inventories will continue to build into the second half of the year, an event we have not seen in years and years.""
Intel rose 13% in the time between Rasgon's upgrade and downgrade.

 Three weeks after providing a calendar Q3 warning that triggered a massive chip stock rout, Microchip (MCHP +7.3%) has provided Q4 guidance that's in-line with lowered estimates. The microcontroller vendor, which has often seen trends emerge ahead of peers, also said it saw most of its inventory correction in Q3, and expects Q4 sales to be just ""slightly below typical seasonal levels."" Chip stocks are up strongly (SOXX +4%) on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.4%. Since Microchip's warning, a slew of analog chipmakers and microcontroller firms (e.g. Atmel, Freescale, STMicro, Intersil, Linear) have offered light Q4 guidance, and other firms have reported seeing high-end Android weakness (e.g. Synaptics, Cirrus Logic, Amkor). On the other hand, several mobile chipmakers (Skyworks, RF Micro, TriQuint, Silicon Motion), some of which have decent iPhone exposure, have provided strong results and/or guidance. Other chipmakers, such as Broadcom, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx, have rallied after delivering in-line guidance. Susquehanna's Chris Caso: ""By now, we think it’s clear that the weakness MCHP saw in September is not company specific ... The question now is if the full extent of the weakness has been dialed into estimates. If it has, then this would be among the shortest and mildest downturns in many years.""

Analog/power management IC vendor Intersil (ISIL -12.2%) posted a Q3 miss and light Q4 guidance, and forecast on its CC (transcript) its computing market sales would fall ""as much as 20% to 25% sequentially in Q4.""
Intersil attributed roughly half of the decline to to lower PC builds, and the other half to an inventory correction. ""In computing, we're seeing an imbalance between inventory builds and end demand, which will impact Q4.""
Intel (INTC -3.8%) is selling off on a day the Nasdaq is up 0.4%. The chip giant provided a Q3 beat and solid Q4 guidance two weeks ago, but sold off afterwards as analysts argued the gap between Intel's PC CPU sales growth and industry growth was partly due to an inventory build.
Intersil, whose ICs regulate power flows on PC motherboards, expects the inventory correction to be over by Q1, and is counting on the launch of Intel's 14nm Skylake platform (the successor to the just-launched Broadwell, due in 2H15) to provide a boost next year.

Bloomberg reports Microsoft (MSFT -0.7%) has a test version of Windows Server that runs on ARM (ARMH -0.9%) server CPUs. Currently, Windows Server only runs on x86 CPUs, primarily from Intel (INTC -0.7%).
Windows Server support would provide a major boost to the fledgling ARM server CPU ecosystem; software support has remained a question mark for it even as the likes of Dell, H-P, and Facebook gave their backing. OS support would still need to be followed by app support.
AMD (AMD +0.4%), Cavium (CAVM -1.3%), AppliedMicro (AMCC -1.8%), and Marvell (MRVL -0.6%) have each unveiled ARM server CPUs, while often promising better power efficiency than Intel's offerings. Supporters have also noted the potential for ARM-based parts to be optimized for specific tasks (security, storage, networking, etc.); Cavium is among the leaders here.
Intel, for its part, is countering with both low-power Atom server CPUs, and more power-efficient versions of its mainstay Xeon server CPUs (such as the just-launched Grantley). IDC estimates x86 servers (largely running on Windows Server of Linux) accounted for 78% of Q2 server industry revenue.
Providing ARM support for Windows Server would fit with Satya Nadella's strong interest in broadening the device/platform reach of Microsoft's software and services.

Not surprisingly, the iPad Air 2's (AAPL -0.9%) pricing starts at $499 (16GB Wi-Fi). As with the iPhone 6, Apple has doubled storage capacities for higher-tier models; 64GB and 128GB Wi-Fi-only models respectively go for $599 and $699. The original Air now starts at $399.

Very little time was spent discussing the iPad Mini 3. Moreover, while the Air 2 features (like the iPhone 6) 802.11ac Wi-Fi and an 8MP rear camera, the Mini 3 offers 802.11n Wi-Fi and a 5MP camera.
The Mini 3's pricing starts at $399, as expected. The Mini 2 (also has a retina display) now starts at $299, and (notably) the original, non-retina Mini is being kept around with a $249 starting price. The price points for the older models could help Apple grab some mid-range share from Android rivals.
A 27"" retina iMac featuring an eye-popping 5210x2880 resolution (67% more pixels than 4K) has been shown off. ""It's the world's highest-resolution display,"" declares VP Phil Schiller. The system is still only 5mm thick at its edges, and its display consumes 30% less power than its predecessor's.
Retina iMac models run on quad-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 and i7 CPUs (3.5GHz.-4GHz.), and starts at $2,499. AMD (AMD +1.3%) is supplying a high-end Radeon R9 GPU. The 27"" non-retina iMac will start at $1,799, and its 21.5"" peer $1,099.
Apple is counting on its new iPads to spark a sales rebound: iPad revenue fell 8% Y/Y in calendar Q2 amid extended upgrade cycles and share gains for low-end Android tablets.
Analyst/Apple fan Ben Thompson recently argued the iPad has been hurt by softening developer support relative to the iPhone, along with the popularity of bigger phones and thinner/lighter PCs (such as the MacBook Air).

Up more than 2% following a headline beat for Q3 results, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is lower by 3.6% premarket as Morgan Stanley cuts the stock to Underweight, citing concerns over an inventory build (also not helping is another slump in the broad averages).
Commenting on ""very solid"" results, analyst Joseph Moore says the disparity between unit growth of 15% and flat PC unit growth implies an inventory build, and is thus worrisome. This suggests a larger risk of an overbuild in H2, and unit growth deceleration in 2015 H1.

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Data Center Group saw broad-based strength in Q3, CEO Brian Krzanich noted on the CC. Enterprise sales rose 11%, networking 16%, HPC 22% (good for MLNX), and cloud 34%.
He added Intel's new Grantley Xeon CPUs are seeing strong uptake, and that the chip giant now has 35 custom Xeon SKUs for various clients. Facebook, eBay, Microsoft, and other Web giants have been avid buyers of custom Intel server CPUs.
15M tablet CPUs were shipped in Q3; Intel still expects 40M in 2014. The company promises a ""substantial improvement"" in mobile chip profitability next year as contra revenue payments drop, but doesn't expect the segment to turn profitable.
Aside from a stabilizing market, Intel thinks PC division sales benefited from share gains (no doubt against AMD) and higher inventories (they were depressed a year ago). A couple of analysts pressed Intel on inventories; the company insists customers have an ""appropriate amount."" A mix shift towards Bay Trail Atom CPUs pressured ASPs.
On CNBC (video), CFO Stacy Smith noted developed markets are still faring better than emerging markets, and argued Microchip (responsible for the warning heard round the chip world) ""[plays] in different segments.""

Intel's (INTC +0.4%) deal to invest up to $1.5B in a Tsinghua Unigroup holding company that owns Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics will both help it better penetrate the low-end Chinese smartphone/tablet market and allow it to sidestep antitrust regulators, thinks Rosenblatt Securities. Chinese regulators have taken aim at Qualcomm and Microsoft, among others.
Rosenblatt doubts the deal will have a big near-term impact on the mobile baseband market, but thinks it could be a long-term negative for MediaTek and Marvell (MRVL -0.7%), both of whom have sizable low-end Chinese shares. Spreadtrum/RDA foundry partner SMIC (SMI +1.4%) is seen as a possible beneficiary.
Wells Fargo observes Spreadtrum had a 16% Q2 baseband share (#3, behind Qualcomm and MediaTek), and that its Chinese share is much higher. Spreadtrum's 3G baseband share was at 11%.
On SA, ex-Intel employee Ed McKernan argues a strategy of providing Atom mobile CPU designs to 3rd-party processor vendors (such as Spreadtrum and Rockchip) could help Intel narrow its huge mobile losses.

No details yet on the size of the stakes, or how much Intel is paying. Tencent Tech recently reported Intel is taking a 20% stake in Spreadtrum for $1.5B; given Spreadtrum was sold last year at a $1.78B valuation, that figure might be off.
Before being taken private, Spreadtrum was reporting strong sales growth for its low-cost 2G and 3G baseband modems, which have scored many Chinese phone design wins. The company also sells RF transceivers, and has rolled out a 4G baseband that supports China Mobile's TD-LTE 4G network.
Notably, Spreadtrum competes against Intel's Infineon baseband unit, which is trying to ramp its 4G baseband sales with the help of Samsung design wins. However, Intel is just 4 months removed from partnering with another low-cost Chinese competitor (app processor vendor Rockchip), as it tries to grab share from Qualcomm/MediaTek and narrow its large mobile losses.

805,Nervous times for retail sector ahead of Apple event,"Sep. 9, 2014, 9:23 AM","
 A large patch of the retail sector will have their ears perked up this afternoon to see what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivers up with its iWatch announcement or teaser. Though the company's entry into wearable technology is considered nearly a certainty, the unknown variable is if the product will end up falling under the ""gadget"" category or be another Apple device revolution. 
Computerworld's Mike Egan is in the latter camp: ""The iWatch should be most comparable to the Mac and the iPhone, Apple's two most stunning revolution."" Forrester Research isn't waiting for details, forecasting 10M iWatch sales by 2016 - a mark which could dent demand for high-end watches. Showtime is 1:00 pm ET.

808,Intel officially launches 14nm Core M CPUs,"Sep. 5, 2014, 12:49 PM","

Four weeks after providing technical details for its Core M notebook/tablet CPUs, Intel (INTC +0.5%) has officially launched them.
Initial systems based on Core M, the first CPU line to leverage Intel's 14nm Broadwell architecture, are due in October. Dell, H-P, Lenovo, and Asus are among the OEMs launching systems this year.
Intel asserts Core M ""enables up to 50 percent faster compute performance and 40 percent faster graphics performance"" than comparable 22nm Haswell CPUs. Core M parts are also said to be 50% smaller, and to require 60% less thermal power.
Intel, which is looking to enable converged devices that deliver PC-like performance in tablet-like form factors, has already promised certain Core M CPUs will enable fanless ~10"" devices that are only 8mm-10mm thick. A slide picked up by AnandTech shows Intel estimates a CPU running a 10.1"" tablet that's only 8mm thick should have a max power draw of less than ~4W. For a 13.3"" tablet, the figure rises to ~5W.
The launch of Core M/Broadwell extends Intel's manufacturing process lead over AMD (AMD +0.1%), which has been trying to lower its PC dependence. While Broadwell lines use a 14nm process, AMD's Kaveri (desktop), Kabini (notebook), and Beema/Mullins (notebook/tablet) lines use 28nm processes from TSMC and Globalfoundries.

Amir Faintuch, the president of Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Atheros Wi-Fi/connectivity chip unit, has been hired by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to be an SVP/co-GM for its Platform Engineering Group (handles chip R&D).
Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy talks up Faintuch's expertise in SoC development - though best known for its Wi-Fi offerings, Atheros' product line now also covers Bluetooth, GPS, and home networking ICs, as well as Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips.

Intel's bio page currently shows 3 Platform Engineering GMs: Rani Borkar, Aicha Evans, and Joshua M. Walden. However, each has the title of VP rather than SVP.
Qualcomm is only a year removed from seeing Faintuch's predecessor, Craig Barratt, leave for Google. More recently, the company saw business development/Qualcomm Labs chief Peggy Johnson leave for Microsoft.
Separately, Intel has launched new Core i7 Extreme Edition CPUs. Though the 22nm chips are (high-margin) niche products meant for gaming rigs and low-end workstations, they're notable for being the first Intel desktop CPU line to support eight cores and DDR4 RAM (previous). Pricing ranges from $389-$999.

IDC estimates global server sales rose 2.5% Y/Y in Q2 to $12.6B. That marks a turnaround from the 2.2% drop seen in Q1, and the 4.4% drop seen in Q4. Gartner estimates sales grew 2.8%.
IDC declares the server market, hurt in recent quarters by system consolidation and a shift in demand towards the white-label gear beloved by Web giants (referred to by IDC as ODM Direct), is seeing ""the beginning of a cyclical refresh cycle."" It sees the pending launch of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Grantley Xeon CPUs, along with Microsoft's plans to end Windows Server 2003 support, lifting sales into 2015.
Sales of x86 servers (mostly Intel-based) rose 7.8% in Q2, and now make up 78% of industry revenue. Non-x86 server sales fell 12.8%.
Market leader H-P's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 40 bps Y/Y to 25.4%, with x86 growth offsetting Itanium weakness. #2 IBM's share fell 340 bps to 23.6% ahead of the sale of its x86 server ops to Lenovo; on the bright side, IBM's decline narrowed from Q1's 600 bps.
#3 Dell's share fell 160 bps to 16.2%. #4 Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) grew 10 bps to 5.9%, with engineered system growth offsetting declines for older UNIX/SPARC server lines. #5 Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which recently proclaimed its UCS server ops are on a $3B/year run rate, saw its share rise 140 bps to 5.8% on the back of 35% growth.

Supply chain sources tell Digitimes Intel (INTC -0.3%) shipped less than 15M tablet CPUs in 1H14, and is now ""aggressively cooperating"" with Taiwanese and Chinese tablet vendors to hit its full-year target of 40M.
The site adds new Intel-based low-end tablets from Chinese/Taiwanese firms are expected to enter mass-production in late September or early October. A baseband/app processor meant for low-end tablets is due in 1H15, courtesy of a partnership with China's Rockchip.
In addition to Apple and Samsung's use of internally-developed app processors, slowing industry growth is acting as a headwind for Intel. IDC estimates global tablet shipments rose 3.9% Y/Y in Q1, and 11% in Q2.
Thanks in part to major contra revenue (marketing subsidy) payments to OEMs, Intel's mobile chip segment posted a $1.12B op. loss in Q2. Morgan Stanley has estimated the business will need to reach $8B-$10B/year in sales (up from 2013's $1.38B) to break even.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is buying Avago's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Axxia network processor unit for $650M in cash. The deal is expected to close in Q4.
The unit was obtained by Avago through the LSI merger. It had 2013 revenue of $113M, and employs 650 people.
The acquisition broadens Intel's product line within a competitive network processor market that also features Broadcom, Marvell, Cavium, and Freescale, among others.
The chip giant bought Ethernet switch processor startup Fulcrum Microsystems in 2011, and (thanks to the Fulcrum deal) counts data center switch vendor Arista Networks among its clients. The adoption of software-defined networking (SDN - shifts network intelligence to software-based controllers)  is expected to boost demand for off-the-shelf silicon relative to proprietary ASICs.
Notably, the Axxia line relies on ARM and IBM PowerPC CPU cores rather than x86 cores. However, the processors are often used in PCIe cards within servers running Intel x86 CPUs.

Back in May, Avago agreed to sell LSI's flash product unit to Seagate for $450M.

815,"Intel details Broadwell, promises big power savings","Aug. 11, 2014, 2:36 PM","

Whereas Intel's (INTC +1.3%) 22nm Haswell CPU architecture aims to deliver at least a 1% increase in performance for every 1% increase in power draw, its 14nm Broadwell architecture shoots for a 2% performance gain for each 1% power increase.
Together with the gains that come from smaller transistor sizes, Broadwell's power draw is improved with the help of 15% and 10% respective drops in capacitance and minimum operating voltage, and a sizable reduction in leakage.
In addition, Intel has improved the power draw of its platform controller hub (integrated within CPU packages) and voltage regulator ICs, and cut the amount of extra power required by its Turbo Boost mode.
On the performance front, Intel is aiming for a 5%+ increase in processed instructions per CPU clock cycle relative to Haswell, and will bundle an integrated GPU that supports the latest graphics APIs, thus addressing (as noted by AnandTech)  a past shortcoming.
Systems based on Intel's tablet/ultrabook-focused Core M Broadwell CPUs (previous) are expected this holiday season. Intel wants to offer Core M CPUs with only 3W-5W of max power draw - all Core M parts will be under 10W - and which can be used in fanless ~10"" tablets that are only 8mm-10mm thick. The Surface Pro 3 (uses Core i3/i5/ii7 CPUs) is only 9.1mm thick, but also contains a fan.
Stabilizing PC sales have lowered the pressure Intel faces to produce a mobile breakthrough. However, Broadwell/Core M is still pivotal to Intel's attempts to grab share from ARM-based mobile CPUs by enabling converged devices that fuse PC-like performance with low power draw and mobile-friendly form factors.

816,IBM-licensed servers take aim at Intel's server CPU dominance,"Jul. 28, 2014, 7:22 PM","

3rd-party servers based on IBM's Power architecture will hit the market in early 2015, says IBM exec Ken King. He adds the first Power systems will be aimed at cloud and high-end applications. They'll run on Big Blue's Power8 CPUs.
3rd-party Power CPUs are also expected in time. IBM first announced plans to license Power to third parties a year ago. The company's own Power server sales have been plunging amid a broader decline in UNIX and non-x86 server demand; they fell 28% Y/Y in Q2.
Early supporters for IBM's effort include Nvidia, Samsung, Micron, and most notably Google, which (like other Web giants) buys huge quantities of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs to power its servers. Power8's proponents claim big performance gains relative to Intel's x86 Xeon CPUs; individual Power8 chips can feature 12 cores and support up to 96 threads.
King says Google, known for its obsession with performance and power efficiency, could be intrigued by the fact Power can support more virtual machines than x86. As with the budding ARM server CPU market, software support will take some time.
Intel, whose server CPU unit towers over the market and is coming off a strong Q2, is trying to counter the Power/ARM threats both by rolling out new low-power Atom server CPUs, and by expanding its custom chip work for Internet clients. Upcoming products will offer more customization by placing an FPGA and a Xeon CPU in the same package.

""Historically, Intel stock has good correlation with gross margins and Intel gross margins which peaked in the mid 60's and may climb to 63% to 65% again in 2014/2015,"" writes Roth's Krishna Shankar, one of three analysts to upgrade Intel's (INTC +6.8%) following its guidance hike.
On top of boosting revenue guidance, Intel has hiked its Q2 gross margin forecast by 100 bps to 62%-66% - up from a Q1 level of 59.7%.
Shankar notes Intel's blended ASPs have been rising the last 8 quarters due to Ivy Bridge/Haswell launches, manufacturing efficiencies, enterprise/emerging markets strength, and a ""lack of competition in PC and server markets from a weakened AMD."" He is, however, worried Intel's server CPU ""quasi-monopoly"" could be challenged by upcoming ARM server CPU launches.
Some of those with a less enthusiastic take on Intel's numbers, such as Nomura, argue business PC sales are getting a temporary boost from Microsoft's decision to end Win. XP support (sparking upgrades), and that consumer PC demand is still soft.
In response, Credit Suisse argues that even if 70% of Intel's Q2 upside came from corporate demand, it would only equal 5% of the XP base. It sees the 2H launch of Intel's Grantley server CPUs (previous) providing further EPS upside.

As part of a change of coverage for chip stocks, Piper is upgrading Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Overweight, and downgrading Broadcom (BRCM) to Neutral.
The firm thinks Intel will benefit from stabilizing PC sales, and is worried about Broadcom's mobile customer concentration (presumably with Apple and Samsung).
IDC still expects PC shipments to fall another 6% in 2014. But Y/Y decline rates have been narrowing in recent quarters.
OTR Global recently reported Broadcom's 3G baseband chip sales to Samsung have fallen sharply. Samsung has also taken steps to increase its use of in-house Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, though that hasn't stopped Broadcom from continuing to secure combo chip design wins.
Apple bought Bluetooth chipmaker Passif Semi last year (possibly for iWatch R&D), but hasn't yet done anything to suggest it's working on Wi-Fi chips.

A year after unveiling its own software distribution for the very popular Hadoop framework (widely used to handle big data analytics projects), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is abandoning its offering, and throwing its money and resources behind market leader Cloudera.
The chip giant calls the deal the ""single largest data center technology investment in its history."" Cloudera just raised $160M after filing to sell shares at a valuation as high as $1.84B.
The startup offers proprietary management software to go with its open-source Hadoop distribution. Competition is provided by private Hortonworks and EMC's Greenplum unit (part of its Pivotal spinoff).
As part of the deal, Cloudera will make Intel's CPUs its ""preferred platform,"" and optimize its Hadoop distribution for them. Cloudera will also support Intel's data center fabric, flash memory, and security tech.
As always, Intel's primary goal is to drive CPU sales - Hadoop projects often make use of Xeon server CPUs, and Intel is hoping relatively few projects rely on rival architectures such as ARM, SPARC, and Power. Data center chief Diane Bryant predicts ""Hadoop will be the application that is deployed across more servers than any other enterprise application.""

Intel's (INTC -0.2%) foundry deal with Altera (ALTR -1.2%), first announced a year ago, has been expanded to include chip packages that combine Altera's next-gen Stratix 10 FPGAs (set to be manufactured using Intel's cutting-edge 14nm process) with DRAM, SRAM, ASICs, and other chips.
Intel and Altera declare the packages will combine the density/integration benefits of its traditional 2.5D/3D chip-packaging approaches with ""favorable economic metrics,"" and that Altera's Intel-manufactured FPGA chip dies will offer unmatched densities and component integration.
Altera is counting on Intel's manufacturing expertise to give it an edge over archrival Xilinx (XLNX -0.8%), which continues to rely on TSMC (TSM +0.4%).
TSMC also happens to be Altera's traditional foundry partner. Xilinx began shipping FPGAs based on the foundry's new 20nm process last fall.

Intel has said it plans to be a ""selective"" foundry for 3rd-party chipmakers, one focused on higher-margin/value-add deals. In addition to Altera, the chip giant may have landed Cisco as a client.

The chip giant had disappointed enthusiasts last year by failing to offer unlocked Haswell CPUs with Iris Pro.
Intel is also providing details about two upcoming Haswell-based enthusiast offerings: Devil's Canyon (due in mid-2014), which offers a better thermal interface material and packaging, and an Extreme Edition CPU (due in 2H) that will be the company's first desktop part to support 8 cores and the DDR4 memory standard.
For mainstream users, Intel has unveiled Ready Mode, a standby-mode solution for PCs that syncs files and enables home streaming while drawing less than 5W of power. The company is providing new form factors/reference designs for OEMs, including ones for a small-form-factor gaming system and a portable (battery-backed) all-in-one PC.
IDC sees global desktop shipments falling another 6% this year to 129.1M, with declines in both developed and emerging markets. But as Nvidia and Logitech can vouch, the enthusiast/gaming segment has been holding up relatively well.

Lithography equipment giant ASML has ""paused"" the development of hardware meant to work with next-gen 450mm wafers, which offer 125% more wafer space (and thus better economies of scale) than current-gen 300mm wafers. Likewise, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) CEO Gary Dickerson says the 450mm migration ""has definitely been pushed out from a timing standpoint.""
Due to ASML's move, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which agreed in 2012 to pour $4.1B into the company to help finance investments in 450mm wafers and EUV lithography, has ""adjusted"" the pace of its payments to ASML.
Last year, Intel began constructing a $2B Oregon development fab meant to be its first 450mm facility. But it's reevaluating its timetable amid soft PC demand and concerns about its share of the bill. Spokesman Chuck Mulloy: ""We still believe 450 is the right thing to do ... But we have been clear: we will not do it ourselves.""
EUV, considered necessary to maintain Moore's Law long-term, has also seen delays. ASML CEO Peter Wennink recently predicted EUV will reach the stability levels required by chip manufacturers by the 2H16 or 2017.

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new MXC server interconnect cables leverage the chip giant's silicon photonics tech and optical fibers developed by Corning (NYSE:GLW) to enable 1.6Tbps transfer speeds (800Gbps each way) via 64 fibers running at 25Gbps apiece. Traditional solutions work at 10Gbps, and max out at 12-24 fibers.
Corning plans to begin selling MXC cable assemblies, which have a range of 300 meters, in Q3. Intel asserts the technology's per-fiber throughput could eventually double to 50Gbps. The companies think supercomputer (HPC) vendors and cloud computing firms will be among the first buyers.
Over time, MXC's blistering speeds stand to further Intel's goal of creating server architectures in which CPU, memory, storage, networking, and other resources can be separately pooled and upgraded as needed. ""The ability to take my memory and stash it a rack away, optical can enable that,"" says Intel exec Mario Paniccia.
Intel's efforts pose a challenge to optical component vendor Finisar (NASDAQ:FNSR), whose shares sold off a year ago on worries about Intel and Cisco's silicon photonics efforts. They're also a challenge to high-speed interconnect leader Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX), which last year acquired silicon photonics startup Kotura and 100G interconnect developer IPtronics.

Three years after launching its last big refresh (the 32nm Westmere-EX family) for its high-end Xeon E7 server CPU line, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has rolled out its Xeon E7 v2 family. The first reviews for the chips, which rely on Intel's 22nm Ivy Bridge platform, have been mostly positive.
Whereas Intel's low-end Atom server CPU lines (such as Avoton) are aimed at cheap, low-power, servers, and meant to head off competition from ARM server CPU vendors, the E7 v2 line is meant to handle demanding and/or mission-critical workloads such as ERP software, high-performance computing, and data mining.
The family supports up to 15 cores, consume as much as 155W, and cost as much as $6,841. It will face off against  RISC server CPU platforms from IBM and Oracle. While Intel has been steadily taking share from RISC platforms, IBM and Oracle have been busy refreshing their lineups over the last year.
AnandTech's benchmarks show major performance gains relative to prior-gen E7 CPUs. The site also notes the E7 v2 line supports more RAM than RISC alternatives, which could be very useful for some big data/analytics workloads.

PC industry names outperformed amid a broader tech rally, aided by a JPMorgan Intel (INTC +4%) note that argued PC demand is stabilizing, and tablet cannibalization diminishing. A number of chip stocks also rallied strongly (SOXX +2.1%).
Also: Major hard drive suspension assembly maker Hutchinson has reported above-consensus Dec. quarter sales, while citing strong demand for 2.5"" notebook drive assemblies. Seagate and Western Digital both rallied.
JPMorgan's Christopher Danely, who upgraded Intel to Overweight, has raised his 2014 estimates soundly above consensus ahead of the chip giant's Thursday Q4 report. Danely notes Intel, Microsoft, H-P, and others have said PC demand is improving, and that Taiwan's big-4 notebook contract manufacturers collectively grew their shipments 7% Q/Q in Q4. Q1 shipments are expected to drop in-line with seasonality.
He also points out tablet shipment growth is decelerating, and forecasts shipments will only rise 25% in 2014 (down from 53% in 2013).
Danely's optimism contrasts with another bearish Intel note from Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon, who estimates five mobile CPU sales are needed to make up for one PC CPU sale, and doubts Intel's foundry business will move the needle.

894,Intel rallies; Goldman thinks Q4 sales could top guidance midpoint,"Jan. 13, 2014, 12:06 PM","

Though reiterating a Sell and $16 PT on Intel (INTC +1.5%), Goldman's James Covello thinks the chip giant's Q4 sales will beat its guidance midpoint ($13.7B, nearly even with a $13.72B consensus) when it reports on Thursday.
Maxim's Ashok Kumar made a similar prediction two weeks ago, while citing ""upside seen in PC builds/shipments and data center demand.""
Covello says a talk with president Renee James (appointed last year) was ""the most open, engaging and friendly strategic dialogue we have had with [Intel] in 10 years,""  and left him with a much better grasp of Intel's strategy (though it still disagrees with parts of it).
He thinks Intel's new management is ""more open to differing perspectives and is more attuned to market dynamics,"" and is looking to use its mobile processors to increase utilization rates (and thus margins).
At the same time, Covello believes Intel is better off focusing on its budding foundry business (where its manufacturing lead gives it an edge) than on mobile, and continues to think its ""core advantage is in segments that require high processing power,"" rather than low power consumption.

IDC and Gartner respectively estimate PC shipments fell 5.6% and 6.9% Y/Y in Q4. Those numbers represent improvements from estimated Q3 declines of 7.6% and 8.6%. For the full year, both firms think shipments dropped 10% (to 315M and 316M, respectively).
Gartner thinks U.S. PC sales (outperformed in Q3) have bottomed, but nonetheless estimates they fell 7.5%, and states ""consumer spending during the holidays did not come back to PCs as tablets were one of the hottest holiday items.""
IDC thinks U.S. shipments only fell 1.6%, thanks to healthy enterprise demand. EMEA and much of Asia-Pac remained weak, but Japan delivered positive growth. The U.S. and Japan have higher ASPs and lower piracy rates than many emerging markets.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) added to its market lead in Q4: IDC assigns the company an 18.6% share (+250 bps Y/Y). #2 H-P, which performed well in its October quarter, is given a 16.8% share (-50 bps); both IDC and Gartner think H-P's U.S. sales were weak. #3 Dell, which has been cutting prices to gain share, is given a 12.2% share (+130 bps).

H-P and Lenovo have each rolled out a slew of new Windows and Android notebooks, tablets, and convertibles at CES. Lenovo's pricing has arguably been more aggressive than H-P's.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has unveiled RealSense, a ""3D depth and 2D camera module"" for PCs that the chip giant promises will deliver ""highly accurate"" gesture recognition, as well as ""facial features for understanding movement and emotions,"" the ability to detect foregrounds and backgrounds, and 3D scanning capabilities.
Lenovo, H-P, Dell, and others plan to offer PCs and tablets featuring RealSense in 2H14. In an early proof of concept, Microsoft is updating its Skype and Lync apps to allow users to remove backgrounds during a video call with the help of RealSense.
The announcement comes six months after Intel bought gesture recognition tech developer Omek Interactive. Odds are Intel's primary goal with RealSense isn't to profit from camera module sales, but to stoke demand for new multimedia apps requiring powerful CPUs.

Nvidia (NVDA +1.6%) has unveiled its Tegra K1 mobile app processors. The K1 chips, formerly codenamed Logan and Parker, are the first Tegra offerings to feature a GPU based on Nvidia's Kepler PC GPU architecture, and manage to pack 192 GPU cores (the prior-gen Tegra 4 has 72). (PR)
The K1, believed to leverage TSMC's cutting-edge 20nm manufacturing process, is also the first Tegra solution to support Nvidia's CUDA developer platform (optimizes apps for Nvidia GPUs). CES attendees have been impressed by demos showing K1-powered tablets delivering desktop-caliber graphics.
Two versions are offered: a quad-core chip featuring off-the-shelf ARM (ARMH -0.1%) CPU cores, and (more interestingly) a solution featuring two powerful custom 64-bit ARM cores (codenamed Denver). Apple and Qualcomm have already unveiled 64-bit ARM processors, which carry higher royalty rates than 32-bit chips.
Devices featuring the 32-bit and 64-bit chips are respectively set to arrive in 1H14 and 2H14. Nvidia is counting on the K1 to help Tegra sales (-54% Y/Y in FQ3) to rebound following a rough 2013. They'll face tough competition from Qualcomm (QCOM +0.3%) - its baseband/app processor integration remains a big selling point for many OEMs - and from a newly mobile-focused Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). In addition, indirect competition is provided by Apple and Samsung's in-house processors.
Nvidia's mobile struggles have led the company to begin offering to license Kepler and other IP to third-party chipmakers.

Sources tell The Verge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its OEM partners plan to show off tablets/convertibles capable of simultaneously running Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) at CES. The products will reportedly be able to run Android and Windows apps side by side.
Though Samsung and Asus have experimented with Android/Windows hybrids, there hasn't yet been a major push behind the concept, which fuses the world's most popular mobile and PC platforms. Intel is uniquely positioned to address the opportunity, since its x86 CPUs, unlike ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) CPUs, can run both Android and Windows 8.
However, sources state neither Microsoft nor Google supports the initiative, given doing so means indirectly supporting a rival platform. Microsoft, which is scrambling to improve developer support for Windows Phone and Metro-style Windows apps, might be especially on edge.
The Verge observes Microsoft could make OEMs think twice by withholding marketing support and/or license discounts, and that Google could restrict access to Google Play and others apps/services.
Ironically, investment firm Longboard Asset Management declared in October Android/Windows hybrids are a key reason to be bullish on Microsoft. The firm called such products a ""game changer"" for the software giant, particularly in the enterprise.
Likewise, the devices could strengthen Google's high-end and enterprise tablet positions. The iPad still claims an outsized share of these segments, even as Android has gobbled up low-end tablet share.

""There are still a lot of things that slow us down–how we make decisions, the number of people who feel like they have to have a say,"" says Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich in an interview. Since becoming CEO last year, Krzanich has made a priority out of getting Intel to move more quickly in a mobile processor market currently dominated by ARM-based solutions.
Krzanich points to the speed at which Intel launched its ultra-low-power Quark processor - circuit boards were distributed just six weeks after management decided to launch the product - as evidence Intel's culture is changing. He asserts a giant market opportunity exists for Quark in the embedded/wearables space. ""We’ll show you some things that you would never have thought could become smart and communicate.""
Krzanich promises to show off a slew of innovative Intel-powered wearables and tablets at CES next week. ""What you will see at CES [are] tablets that are doing some things that you didn’t think possible ... We’ll bring some new innovations in imaging, for example.""
At the same time, he admits Samsung and Apple's smartphone dominance presents a big challenge. Apple fully relies on its A-series processors for iOS hardware, and Samsung partly relies on its Exynos processors. Qualcomm and other ARM-based vendors currently handle most of Samsung's 3rd-party mobile processor needs, though Intel has scored some tablet design wins.

901,Maxim sees Intel beating Q4 estimates; mobile CPU wins reportedly scored,"Dec. 31, 2013, 5:22 PM","

Citing ""upside seen in PC builds/shipments and data center demand,"" Maxim's Ashok Kumar thinks Intel (INTC +0.4%) will post Q4 revenue at the high end of its guidance range of $13.2B-$14.2B; the consensus ($13.72B) is nearly at the midpoint of that range.
Like others, Kumar thinks the corporate Windows 7 upgrade cycle is giving Intel a lift. With Microsoft ending Windows XP support in April, many firms are upgrading systems in advance. Kumar's remarks come a day after Digitimes reported TSMC is seeing order pull-ins from PC and smartphone chipmakers.
Meanwhile, Digitimes reports today Intel has scored mobile CPU wins from OEMs who have historically relied on MediaTek (popular with low-end Android OEMs), and is partnering with a variety of Chinese ""white box"" vendors.
The site previously reported Intel is planning to spend $1B in 2014 on marketing subsidies to drive Bay Trail adoption. The chip giant has set a goal of selling 40M tablet CPUs next year, up ~4x from 2013 levels.
Reviews for Intel's new Bay Trail Atom CPUs have been solid. ZDNet's James Kendrick, after trying out an Asus Bay Trail tablet: ""This tablet feels as fast as any Core processor-equipped laptop or tablet I've used with Windows 8 ... Bay Trail doesn't feel like a stripped down mobile processor, it is as fast as any processor should be.""
Does that performance spell cannibalization risk? Bay Trail CPUs list for $32-$37; many Core notebook CPUs go for over $100.

Digitimes reports top chip foundry TSMC (TSM +1.7%), which counts AMD (AMD +1.7%) and Nvidia (NVDA +1.2%) among its clients is seeing pull-in orders from PC and smartphone chipmakers for parts set to be delivered in the second half of January.
The PC orders are said to reflect ""a rebound of replenishment demand in the PC sector and an improvement in sales in the end market."" The report comes three weeks after Citi made note of improving/stabilizing PC demand, and cited it as a reason for upgrading Intel (INTC +0.7%).
Intel was hit hard last month after guiding for flat 2014 revenue/EPS growth. With IDC expecting PC unit shipments to drop 3.8% in 2014 after falling 10.1% in 2013, expectations are low.
PC sales to enterprises (aided by the Windows 7 upgrade cycle) and developed markets have been showing signs of stabilization, but sales to emerging markets continue to fall sharply. Given tablet cannibalization began affecting developed markets first, their stabilization (assuming it holds) could be a sign emerging markets will bottom somewhere in 2014.
Regarding smartphone orders, Digitimes reports demand related to high-end smartphones is picking up thanks to pending product launches, many of which will come at CES (Jan. 7-10) and the Mobile World Congress (Feb. 24-27).

With ARM-based (ARMH +2.6%) CPUs currently having a minimal presence in the massive server CPU market, a report that Google is thinking of developing its own ARM-based server CPUs has gone over well with ARM investors.
In addition to Google, Facebook has shown an interest in ARM. A recent post from a Facebook developer suggests the company is working to port some of its internal software for use with ARM CPUs.
AppliedMicro (AMCC -4.6%), an early leader in the ARM server CPU space (courtesy of its X-Gene chips), wound up selling off after opening higher. There may be concerns Google will open-source its CPU designs to help foster a broader ecosystem for them, as it has done with many pieces of software. AMD, Marvell, and private Calxeda are also targeting the ARM server CPU market.
Intel (INTC -0.7%), whose server CPU division had a $1.39B Q3 op. profit on the back of 12% Y/Y rev. growth, finished down modestly. Google/Facebook would act as big reference wins for ARM, which still face major software ecosystem challenges as it tries to grow its server presence. Intel is trying to counter ARM with its low-power Avoton Atom server CPUs.
FBR, which just started coverage on ARM with an Outperform, thinks ARM-based designs could grab 10% of the server CPU market by 2018, thanks to a 50% share in the fast-growing microserver segment.

IDC estimates server sales fell 3.7% Y/Y in Q3. That's a modest improvement from Q2's estimated 6.2% drop, but hardly a figure that will bring cheer to industry players. Gartner estimates revenue fell 2.1% in Q3 vs. 3.8% in Q2.

The embrace by Web/cloud giants of home-grown servers produced by Asian contract manufacturers (ODMs) continues to upend the industry. IDC thinks sales of such servers rose 45% Y/Y, and now make up 6.5% of industry revenue. It estimates nearly 4/5 of these sales came from the U.S., largely from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Rackspace.
#1 H-P (HPQ), which recently reported encouraing enterprise hardware numbers, is assigned a 28.1% share (+150 bps Y/Y) by IDC. #2 IBM, whose total Q3 hardware sales fell 17% Y/Y, is given a 23.4% share (-430 bps).
Newly-private Dell had a 16.2% share (-40 bps, a reversal from recent gains), Cisco (CSCO - still seeing strong UCS server demand) a 5% share (+170 bps), and Oracle (ORCL - hurt by SPARC/UNIX server weakness) a 4.1% share (-60 bps).
In a positive for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), x86 servers took share once again, with sales rising 2.8% and making up 79% of industry revenue. Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) is likely pleased to see Linux servers now make up 28% of industry revenue. Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) servers made up 50%, and UNIX servers just 11%.

Interestingly, emerging markets (shipments -11% to 182.1M) are expected to see a slightly larger drop than ""mature markets"" (-8% to 132M). There have been signs of stabilizing demand in the U.S. and certain other developed markets.

Digitimes' supply chain sources report Intel (INTC +0.7%) plans to offer $1B in 2014 marketing subsidies to tablet vendors adopting its CPUs.
They also state Intel is offering huge price discounts to large OEMs using its new Bay Trail Atom CPUs, and even bundling baseband chips for free, but Intel's Taiwanese unit denies those claims.
Intel has a long history of providing OEMs with marketing subsidies, and the chip giant has made it clear it's willing to spend aggressively to make up for lost time in a tablet CPU market currently dominated by MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Apple/Samsung's in-house processors.
Last week, Intel set a goal of quadrupling its tablet CPU shipments in 2014 to 40M (would be good for a 14% share based on Canalys' latest 2014 tablet forecast).
RBC, which cut shares to Hold this morning, thinks Intel is spending $800M (via shared project/R&D spend and contra revenue) to grow its mobile CPU presence, and forecasts the spending will only yield near-term op. income of $200M. Moreover, the firm sees Intel's combined notebook/mobile processor sales posting only a 3% CAGR from 2013-2016, as soaring Atom sales are offset by declining sales of traditional PC CPUs.
The Other Intel Architecture unit, which includes Intel's Atom and baseband chip ops (among other things), had a $606M Q3 op. loss on $1.1B of revenue.

915,"Bloomberg: Intel asking for $500M for TV business, Verizon thinking big","Nov. 25, 2013, 7:28 PM","


Bloomberg reports Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has set an asking price of $500M for the assets of its would-be Web TV service, and is hoping to reach a deal by year's end.
Though lacking any revenue, the business does have some potentially valuable IP and software assets stemming from startup acquisitions, as well as Intel's efforts to create a unique set-top UI and cloud DVR for its service.

Verizon and Liberty Global have already been rumored to be talking with Intel about possibly buying the unit.
Bloomberg's sources indicate Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is looking to use the Intel unit as a springboard to offer its own Web TV service, one that would expand its TV reach to areas not covered by FiOS. Verizon has reportedly been asking content owners if it would need new contracts to offer a Web TV service, or if it could simply amend its FiOS deals.

917,Intel adds to losses as Street mulls investor day guidance,"Nov. 22, 2013, 11:36 AM","

Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon, who has been bearish on Intel (INTC -4.8%) for some time. ""We could actually feel the cheer leach out of the room a bit during [CFO] Stacy Smiths’s final presentation, as outlook for 2014 (mostly flat on revenues, gross margins, operating income, and capex) was likely not quite as good as some had hoped.""

Goldman (Sell) isn't pleased with Intel's guidance for flat 2014 revenue/EPS growth, nor with its steep capex budget (~$11B). It also thinks the revenue forecast could be aggressive since it ""assumes no negative impact from the end of the corporate [PC] refresh cycle,"" and also assumes a pickup in server CPU division growth to a low-teens rate.

Jefferies, however, is lifting its PT to $32. ""Intel's message was compelling: its product line is geared to the new market reality, PCs are stabilizing, servers are growing, and it expects to grow its tablet MPU shipments by 4x to 40m units in 2014.""
SA contributor and Intel bull Ashraf Eassa is upbeat about the pending launch of Intel's dual-core Merrifield Atom smartphone CPU, the 2H14 launch of its 14nm Cherry Trail Atom tablet CPU (Bay Trail's successor), and (especially) the 2015 launch of its Broxton smartphone/tablet CPUs.
Perhaps the biggest issue weighing on investors' minds: While keeping capex high to maintain its manufacturing edge, Intel is trying to offset declining sales of Core PC CPUs by ramping sales of Atom CPUs that often have far lower ASPs, and which some think could end up cannibalizing low-end Core sales.

920,"More on Intel: PC stabilization seen, foundry opportunities eyed","Nov. 21, 2013, 2:33 PM","

Though the PC market is still declining, it's ""beginning to show signs of stabilization,"" says Brian Krzanich during Intel's (INTC +2.4%) investor day.
The comments follow Q3 data from Gartner and IDC indicating slowing Y/Y shipment declines, thanks to relatively healthy U.S. and enterprise sales. There have also been various supply chain reports noting shipments to developed markets, where Intel's ASPs are higher, are stabilizing a bit (emerging markets remain weak).
Separately, Krzanich states Intel is looking to grow its nascent foundry business, even by taking on 3rd-party mobile chipmakers as clients. Many have speculated Intel, which has already shown a willingness to manufacture ARM-based processors for foundry clients, will try to reel in Apple.
As with mobile CPUs, Intel is banking on its manufacturing process lead to take foundry share (industry giant TSM will remain a formidable rival). Intel has landed FPGA vendor Altera as a client, and reportedly also has a deal with Cisco.

921,"Intel sets aggressive tablet target, Jefferies sees transistor edge","Nov. 21, 2013, 2:12 PM","

At Intel's (INTC +2.2%) annual investor day (webcast), CEO Brian Krzanich has promised his company will quadruple its tablet CPU shipments in 2014, as it makes an all-out push to gain share in a market expected by Gartner to see 263M shipments next year.
Intel is counting on its historical manufacturing process lead to grow rapidly in a market where a large portion of device shipments feature in-house Apple and Samsung CPUs, and where Qualcomm (QCOM - just unveiled a new flagship processor) and MediaTek (just launched an 8-core processor) have respectively carved out decent positions on the high-end and low-end.
OEMs are in the midst of launching tablets featuring Intel's Bay Trail Atom CPU, which offers big performance gains over the prior-gen Clover Trail. Intel is reportedly planning a slew of mobile CPU launches for 2014. Krzanich asserts an Atom platform due in 2015, codenamed Broxton, will allow OEMs to quickly swap in new CPUs.
Also: Intel will launch a low-end smartphone processor (codenamed SoFIA) in 2H14 that fuses an Atom CPU with a 4G baseband modem. Qualcomm's ability to integrate baseband and app processors (for both high-end and low-end products) has given it a huge edge with many OEMs thus far.

Jefferies argues Intel's transistor tech lead will give it a mobile power consumption edge over ARM-based rivals (such as Qualcomm and MediaTek). Bay Trail is the first Intel mobile CPU to use the company's tri-gate (3D) transistors (they've been included in PC CPUs since 2012).

924,Intel acquires interactive textbook startup Kno,"Nov. 9, 2013, 9:31 AM","

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has acquired Kno, a creator and seller of digital textbooks that can be viewed through mobile, Web, and Windows apps. Terms are undisclosed; with Kno having raised $73M to date, odds are the price tag is in nine figures.
Kno's platform allows publishers to convert standard digital textbooks into interactive titles sporting features such as flash cards, quizzes, and embedded instructional videos, as well as a dashboard that keeps track of reading activity. Intel points out Kno, which competes with Amazon, Apple, and Google's e-textbook offerings, offers 225K titles via 75 publishers.
Though acquiring a digital textbook seller is off the beaten path for Intel, the chip giant does sell home-grown tablets and notebooks meant for the education market, as well as an education-focused software suite.
Moreover, Intel hasn't been shy about making software/services acquisitions it thinks can help drive demand for its CPUs. And Kno might indirectly help the company in a market (tablet processors) where it needs to play catch-up.
Kno is yet another e-textbook rival for online textbook rental leader Chegg (NYSE:CHGG), which is set to go public in the upcoming week at a relatively modest valuation.

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new division, called the Internet of Things Solutions Group, will (like the core Architecture Group) report directly to CEO Brian Krzanich.
The division is being formed a month after Intel launched a low-power Atom CPU (the E3800) meant for embedded devices, and provided details about its tiny/ultra-low-power Quark CPU for wearable/embedded devices (begins shipping in Q1 2014), and also outlined plans to provide hardware/software reference designs for gateway systems meant to provide connectivity from legacy industrial/infrastructure systems.
While ASPs for embedded/wearable CPUs are bound to be lower than those for CPUs, the volumes could be huge. While estimates differ plenty on how many Internet-connected embedded devices will ship over the next decade, they generally run well into the tens of billions.
Intel is bound to face strong competition in this space from ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH), whose low-power CPU cores are already found in billions of embedded devices (Internet-connected or otherwise).

After gradually rising in the week going into its Q3 report, AMD (AMD -13.4%) more than gave back its gains, in spite of beating estimates and issuing above-consensus Q4 guidance.
While sell-side bulls trumpeted AMD's Xbox One/PS4 ramps and the strength of certain other businesses (SeaMicro, workstation GPUs), bears focused on weak PC CPU numbers and commentary (particularly for notebooks), as well as recent gross margin declines.

Goldman (Sell) sees AMD continuing to lose ground to Intel (INTC -0.2%), which has gained notebook share this year with the help  of its low-power Haswell parts, and only saw a 3% Y/Y drop in PC CPU  division sales in Q3 (vs. 15% for AMD).

The entry-level CPUs would be more cost-competitive with standalone ARM-based app processors from Qualcomm (QCOM +1%), Nvidia (NVDA +0.1%), and MediaTek, many of which go for $15-$20. If the report pans out, it suggests Intel is willing to further sacrifice ASPs and margins to grab mobile CPU share; as it is, current Bay Trail CPUs have spawned concerns about the cannibalization of Haswell notebook CPUs.
Digitimes previously reported Intel plans to launch several new mobile CPU lines in 2014/2015, including Bay Trail successors codenamed Cherry Trail (Q314) and Willow Trail (Q414 - that ETA seems aggressive).

For relatively powerful embedded systems such as ATMs, kiosks, infotainment systems, and certain medical devices, Intel is launching its Atom E3800 CPU (codenamed Bay Trail-I). The E3800, available now, features built-in media-processing circuitry and supports 2-4 cores.
Intel's tiny/low-power Quark CPU (previous), aimed at wearable/embedded devices that need minimal horsepower, features just one core clocked at up to 400 MHz. The chip begins shipping in Q1 2014.
Intel is also creating hardware/software designs (the software comes from its McAfee and Wind River units) for ""gateway devices"" that provide Internet connectivity and data-sharing for legacy energy, industrial, and transportation systems. Complementary middleware and analytics tools are also promised.

ARM is also busy improving its position within the embedded market, which has helped fuel the CPU core leader's rapid unit growth. Huge growth is expected over the next several years in the number of Internet-connected devices in operation, but estimates vary plenty.

Intel (INTC +0.3%) is taking full control of an Israeli plant it has leased to Micron (MU +1.3%), and which is currently used to make NOR flash memory. Intel will hire 800 full-time employees and 200 contract workers currently on Micron's payroll.
The chip giant had already expressed interest in taking over the plant, which was set to be shuttered in 2015, as well as in investing $10B to build a new Israeli fab and upgrade an existing facility.
Though the Micron fab will continue making NOR flash for now (NOR demand has been declining), Intel wants to eventually use it to make 10nm CPUs. Intel is looking to begin shipping 10nm CPUs in 2015, though mass-production might not happen until 2016.
Intel is reportedly looking for a $300M-$400M government grant to help pay for its investment. The company directly employs nearly 8K Israeli workers, and is indirectly responsible for many more.
NOR flash vendor Spansion (CODE +4.4%) is rallying.

945,More on Intel: Security software firm acquired,"Sep. 30, 2013, 10:32 PM","

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has bought Sensory Networks, a developer of pattern-matching software for security hardware, for $20M.
Sensory's software runs on both Intel/AMD (x86) CPUs and rival architectures. Its core product, a matching engine called HyperScan, addresses antivirus, intrusion prevention, and deep packet inspection applications, among others; corporate interest in cybersecurity has been picking up this year.
Many security hardware vendors use either custom ASICs or processors from Intel rivals such as Cavium (CAVM). Sensory's software gives Intel another product to bundle.with its CPU offerings for this market. It might also be integrated with the security hardware offered by Intel's Stonesoft unit (acquired in May).

""We believe back to school PC demand has been virtually absent,"" says Sterne Agee's Vijay Rakesh in a critical note on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Moreover, Sterne thinks high inventories and weak demand are pointing to the absence of a holiday season sales boost (normally 5%-7%) as well.
Rakesh now sees PC sales falling 10.7% Y/Y in Q4, worse than a prior forecast for a 9.6% drop. He also questions the ability of smartphone/tablet CPU sales to offset declining PC CPU sales for Intel, given notebook processors typically sell for several times as much as their mobile counterparts. Oddly enough (given Nokia's limited smartphone share), Rakesh also suggests the Microsoft-Nokia deal is a negative for the chip giant.
In August, IDC lowered its 2013 PC shipment growth forecast to -9.7% from a prior -7.8%. The firm estimates PC shipments fell 11.4% Y/Y in Q2 (Gartner is at 10.9%), and has predicted tablet shipments (aided by seasonality) will exceed PC shipments in Q4.

Intel (INTC -2.1%) is selling off a bit after multiple reports emerged indicating its Web TV service plans are in jeopardy, and Bernstein's Stacey Rasgon (Underperform) declares his existing views on slowing cash-return growth are playing out.

Variety has joined Bloomberg and AllThingsD in reporting on Intel's TV service woes. Sources tells the magazine Intel has pushed back its launch date to 2014, and held talks with Netflix and Liberty Media that went nowhere.
Rasgon, who in the past has pointed out Intel's dividend/buyback efforts have led its net cash position to fall below $5B, now states Intel ""has little headroom"" to raise its cash-return rate above current levels of 45%-55% of TTM free cash flow, giving revenue pressures and rising capex.

The Slate 7 Extreme is based on Nvidia's (NVDA -0.6%) Tegra Note reference design, which Nvidia announced yesterday. As specified by the design, the Extreme has a 7"" 1280x800 display, stylus, dual cameras and quad-core Tegra 4 CPU; Nvidia has suggested Note tablets will sell for $199.
The Slate 8 Pro also sports a Tegra 4 chip, along with an 8"" 1600x1200 display and iPad-like 4:3 aspect ratio. The Slate 7 and 10 HD each have 1280x800 displays and dual-core CPUs from an unspecified supplier.
Two Windows 8 tablets/convertibles are also launching, both of which feature Intel's (INTC -0.2%) new quad-core Bay Trail Atom CPU. The Pavillion 11 x2 has an 11.6"" 1366x768 display and up to 128GB of storage, and starts at $600. The Omni 10 has a 10"" 1080p display and 64GB of storage; no word on pricing.

Credit Suisse (Outperform) has raised its Intel (INTC +1.6%) PT to $30 from $28, and argues accelerating Data Center Group (DCG - Xeon server CPUs) growth will boost the chip giant's bottom line.
In Q2, DCG had a $1.23B op. profit on just $2.74B in revenue. By comparison, Intel's PC CPU unit needed $8.1B in revenue to generate a $2.66B op. profit and the Other Intel Architecture Group (inc. Atom/Infineon mobile chips and embedded products) lost $608M on revenue of $942M.
CS' PT hike comes in a month where Intel has begun shipping its Avoton Atom server CPUs, and launched 22nm Xeon CPUs meant for dual-CPU servers. Next year, the company plans to roll out low-power Xeon CPUs that integrate a large amount of I/O and networking functionality.

Evercore reiterated an Underperform yesterday, stating (among other things) PC trends ""remain choppy"" and that higher Xeon ASPs are offset by aggressive pricing for Avoton. The firm sees competition from ARM-based server CPUs (I, II) pressuring Intel's high Xeon ASPs and margins over time.

TechCrunch reports Intel (INTC +3%) has acquired Indisys, a Spanish developer of natural language-processing software, for a price above $26M.
Indisys, a 10-year-old company, has applied its natural language tech to creating mobile virtual assistant, contact center, and search engine, and social network analysis apps, among other products.
Intel's purchase comes as Apple (Siri), Google (Now), and most recently Microsoft (Cortana) each make big investments in voice assistant platforms. Voice-recognition mainstay Nuance (NUAN -0.7%), which helps power Siri, isn't standing idly either.
Voice/gesture recognition is clearly an area of interest for Intel. The company bought gesture-recognition startup Omek in July, and declared at IDF PCs featuring its gesture-recognition tech will arrive in 2014.
Meanwhile, Jefferies' Mark Lipacis, who upgraded Intel to Buy this morning, declares the chip giant ""offers one of the best alpha generation opportunities in semis,"" and praises its efforts to finally leverage its manufacturing leadership to make CPUs ""that are lower power, higher performance and cheaper than competitive solutions.""
It isn't clear yet that Intel's new Bay Trail Atom tablet CPUs will be cheaper or less power-hungry than comparable ARM-based parts, but if Intel's benchmarks are close to accurate, they should have a performance edge.

As expected, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has launched its 22nm Bay Trail Atom tablet CPU line at the Intel Developer Forum. Intel is promising up to a 2x CPU performance boost, and a 3x GPU performance boost over the current-gen Clover Trail, without hurting battery life.
Performance-wise, Bay Trail should be competitive with high-end ARM-based CPUs such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 and Nvidia's Tegra 4. However, some worry they'll also be competitive with Intel's more costly/higher-margin Core notebook CPUs.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has announced a slew of Chromebooks sporting Intel Haswell Core CPUs are on tap, courtesy of OEM partners such as Acer, H-P, Asus, and Toshiba. Google recently added local/offline app support to Chrome OS, a move that stands to strengthen the OS' low-end challenge to Windows.
Intel has also launched new 22nm Xeon CPUs meant for dual-CPU servers (officially given the catchy name Xeon E5 2600 v2).  Improvements over Intel's prior-gen, 32nm, Romley Xeons include support for more cores (12 vs. 8) and threads (24 vs. 16).

IBM is using Intel's latest Xeon parts in its new NeXtScale high-density server line. Like H-P with its Moonshot servers, Big Blue hopes NeXtScale will be adopted some of the Web/cloud companies increasingly opting for a do-it-yourself approach. The first NeXtScale system can pool up to 84 dual-CPU servers in a 19"" rack.
IBM is also trying to address the needs of Web/cloud companies, who generally use Intel CPUs, by licensing its Power CPU architecture.
The Xeon launch comes shortly after Intel began shipping its Avoton Atom server CPUs, which aim to head off ARM-based competition in the high-density/microserver market. Intel claims Avoton can deliver up to 6x better performance/watt than its prior-gen Centerton.

Cherry Trail is said to use Intel's next-gen Airmont CPU architecture, and Willow Trail a succeeding architecture codenamed Goldmont.

Barron's recently noted Intel Intel wants to narrow the delay between Core (PC) and Atom CPU launches for a given architecture, as it makes an all-out effort to gain mobile CPU share from ARM-based (NASDAQ:ARMH) suppliers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and MediaTek.

In June, new CEO Brian Krzanich stated Atom launches could actually precede Core launches for a particular architecture in the future. Digitimes' report suggests that might just happen with Willow Trail. But it's worth noting a mere one-quarter gap between CPU architecture upgrades would be very rare for Intel.
If Intel can ramp 14nm Atom production in 2014, it should have a process edge over its rivals, who will be at 20nm. But Intel still needs to develop chips that fuse powerful CPUs with 4G baseband modems (something Qualcomm has excelled at).
Bay Trail has stoked cannibalization fears. Its successors could heighten them.
Intel's 14nm Broadwell Core CPUs are expected in 2H14. Broadwell's 14nm successor, Skylake, is due in 1H15.

 ""PCs are not going away anytime soon,"" says Piper Jaffray, removing its Sell rating on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and upping the price target to $22 from $20. A weekend Barron's story suggests the company may soon announce an accelerated schedule for production of upcoming Atom chips for smartphones and tablets. Look to September 10 - right down the street from Apple's event in San Francisco will be Intel's IDF conference. Shares +0.8% premarket.  "
970,Intel buys Fujitsu 4G RF chip unit; more on Baird's downgrades,"Aug. 15, 2013, 11:34 AM","

Intel (INTC -1.8%) has quietly acquired a U.S.-based Fujitsu unit that has developed a multimode 4G RF transceiver chip. Terms are undisclosed.
The chip giant calls Fujitsu's transceiver ""probably the most advanced multimode LTE RF transceiver available in the open market."" It should complement Intel's 4G baseband chips, and compete with transceivers from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), and others.
Intel's Infineon mobile chip unit has been slow to roll out a multimode 4G baseband; Intel has promised phones featuring one will arrive early next year. In the meantime, Qualcomm controls a 90%+ share of the burgeoning 4G baseband market.
Meanwhile, Baird's Tristan Gerra justifies his downgrades of Intel and Micron (MU -4.6%) by citing a litany of concerns stemming from an Asian trip. Gerra's findings point to ""a below-seasonal outlook for the second-half, with recent reductions in PC order rates, continued weakness in smartphones, rising analog IC inventories at distributors,"" and the potential for DRAM supply to exceed demand.
Micron recently forecast DRAM bit growth will remain muted in 2H and 2014, leading to a favorable supply/demand balance.

972,"AMD, Nvidia close higher after Jon Peddie numbers released","Aug. 14, 2013, 4:04 PM","

GPU archrivals AMD (AMD +3.4%) and Nvidia (NVDA +4.3%) close higher on a moderately down day for tech. The release of Jon Peddie's Q2 GPU figures could be a factor.
The research firm estimates GPU shipments rose 4.6% Q/Q in Q2 even as PC shipments fell 2.5%. This is attributed to growing consumer interest in ""double-attach"" systems featuring both a discrete GPU and a CPU with an on-board GPU (most of Intel and AMD's latest CPUs have one).
Integrated GPUs have been taking share from discrete GPUs for a long time. Thus, any favorable data regarding discrete demand is likely to be well-received.
Counting integrated GPUs, Intel (INTC +0.2%) is estimated to have a 62% GPU share in Q2, up from 61.1% in Q1 and unchanged Y/Y. AMD is given a 21.9% share, up from Q1's 20.6% but down from 22.7% a year ago. Nvidia is assigned a 16.1% share, down from 18.3% in Q1 but up from 14.8% a year ago.
Nvidia recently released July quarter figures that pointed to Y/Y share gains.
Also: In what could prove a positive for AMD, Digitimes reports game console chip orders for September and October have already come in, and that orders are expected to stay strong November/December. Much, of course, depends on how consumers respond to the actual PS4 and Xbox One launches.

973,IBM partners to broaden Power CPU reach; more on CS' downgrade,"Aug. 6, 2013, 12:30 PM","

With servers running IBM's (IBM -2.2%) Power CPUs (sales -25% Y/Y in Q2) losing share to systems using Intel's (INTC -0.5%) Xeon server CPUs, IBM is forming the OpenPower Consortium, an alliance through which Big Blue will license its Power architecture and related technologies to 3rd-parties, in an effort to create a broad IT hardware ecosystem around them.
Initial partners include Nvidia (NVDA - its GPUs and CUDA computing platform will support Power), Mellanox (MLNX - InfiniBand hardware support is a good bet), Google, and Taiwanese server OEM Tyan,
Google and Tyan's support is noteworthy, given Google and many Internet peers have spurned IBM and other server giants in favor of Intel-based commodity gear made by the likes of Tyan to the specifications of Internet/cloud firms.
Google: ""The consortium has the potential to establish Power architecture as a viable option for applications running within Google's data centers."" Software support remains a near-term challenge.
In downgrading IBM to Underperform, Credit Suisse cites mainframe and (Power-based) UNIX hardware headwinds, weakening free cash flow, and a spending shift towards cloud services.

FY13 (ended June 30) Surface revenue totaled $853M, Microsoft discloses in its 10-K. As Engadget observes, that's less than the $900M write-down recently taken on Surface RT inventories.
""Windows Phone"" revenue rose $1.2B Y/Y; Android royalties likely made up the lion's share of this figure. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets sizable per-unit royalties from Samsung, HTC, ZTE, and other top Android OEMs, and Android sales figures speak for themselves.
Microsoft previously stated ""Windows Phone"" revenue rose by $222M in FQ4.
Advertising spend rose by $898M Y/Y thanks to Windows 8/Surface marketing efforts.
Separately, Asus has joined Samsung in criticizing Windows RT's prospects. The #5 PC maker says it will focus on Intel-based (NASDAQ:INTC) Win. 8 systems.

975,"No camera for Intel TV service, but plenty of cloud storage","Jul. 30, 2013, 1:45 PM","

Intel (INTC +0.3%) has abandoned plans to include a camera with face-detection software in the set-top box for its Web TV service (and use it to deliver targeted ads). Division chief Erik Huggers cites both low-light performance and privacy concerns.
Intel does, however, plan to store every item of programming it offers for 3 days, and use it to offer a comprehensive cloud DVR service.
Lining up content deals for the service, which might be called OnCue, remains a challenge, thanks to the intransigence of incumbents such as Time Warner Cable. Nonetheless, Intel is still looking to enter some markets by year's end.
