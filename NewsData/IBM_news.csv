 It's Capitalist Woodstock day! Tune into the live stream on Yahoo Finance, and come back here to discuss. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger start their Q&A at around 10:30 a.m. ET. The company reported earnings last night, with Q1 operating EPS of $2,163 vs $2,274 in the same quarter a year ago. Stay tuned for updates throughout the day. Asked about whether Berkshire's structure might allow for a Wells Fargo-like sales scandal, Buffett points to a company hotline that gets 4,000 calls a year (""most of them are frivolous ... Anything that looks serious I will hear about"") and suggests that it would be hard for things to get where they were with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) without the CEO knowing, ""and the CEO has to act ... It was a huge, huge, huge error if they were getting some communications and they ignored them or sent them down.??Self-driving vehicles present a real threat to Berkshire's insurance and rail businesses, Buffett says. ""Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to the Burlington Northern,"" he says. ""And if driverless cars became pervasive, it would only be because they were safer ... and that would mean that the overall economic cost of auto-related losses had gone down, and that would drive down the premium income of Geico."" Asked about the unloading of a third of Berkshire's stake in IBM while continuing to build up in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Buffett says ?úI regard them as being quite different businesses. They are two different types of decisions and I was wrong on the first one. And we?ôll find out whether I was right or wrong on the second. I do not regard them as apples and apples. I don?ôt regard them as apples and oranges."" On missed opportunities, ""we failed you"" by not figuring out Google (GOOG, GOOGL) sooner, and ""we blew Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) too,"" Charlie Munger says. ""China has a bright future"" despite growing pains, Munger says, and China's market is a lot cheaper than in the U.S. Buffett has nothing to add: Munger ""gave the headline, China's stock market will outperform the U.S.,"" and he breaks the meeting for lunch, to reconvene at 2:15 p.m. ET. Airlines?(DAL, UAL, LUV, AAL, SKYW, HA, ALK, JBLU, ALGT, JETS) are also a topic of discussion by Buffett and Munger, which isn't a shocker considering that Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) ?now has over $10B invested in the sector. Buffett: ""It's a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it's a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time ... it's fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next 5 or 10 years than at historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx (NYSE:FDX) or UPS (NYSE:UPS).""""It is no cinch that the industry will have more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years, but the conditions have improved for that,"" he observes.

Cisco/IBM say they're targeting ""companies operating on the edge of computer networks such as oil rigs, factories, shipping companies and mines, where time is of the essence but bandwidth is often lacking."" Bell Canada is an initial partner. The tie-up follows the June 2015 launch of Cisco's end-to-end IoT System, and its $1.4B+ February deal to buy major IoT service provider Jasper Technologies. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are also going after the budding market for cloud-based IoT services.
Separately, Cisco has once more restructured its engineering leadership. David Goeckeler, the SVP in charge of Cisco's security products/services, is now also in charge of networking hardware. And three high-profile engineers - Mario Mazzola, Prem Jain, and Luca Cafiero - have been moved to ""advisory"" roles.
The engineers were helping run Insieme Networks, a data center switch/SDN startup Cisco funded and later acquired via its traditional ""spin-in"" strategy. New CEO Chuck Robbins has suggested he's not a fan of spin-ins.

With the help of ""security experts, cryptographers, hardware experts and researchers,"" IBM (IBM -0.8%) says it has created a slew of cloud services meant to enable secure blockchain networks, along with cloud apps leveraging them. Financial services, healthcare, and government clients are among the firms being targeted.
BNY Mellon is an initial user of the service - the bank plans to create ""a unique application for securities lending, using a blockchain network to trade and transfer assets."" IBM promises its cloud platform will ""allow production blockchain networks to be deployed in minutes,"" while supporting Docker containers (alternatives to server virtual machines that run on Linux and feature little overhead), data dashboards, and analytics tools.
While the hype surrounding Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) has cooled some, corporate interest in the blockchain - the distributed/encrypted ledger technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - for enabling cheap and secure transactions remains high. JPMorgan, Goldman, and other i-banks unveiled plans last year to create standards for using blockchain in the financial industry. In March 2015, Reuters reported IBM has held informal talks with central banks about creating a system for enabling blockchain-based transactions that don't require a bank or payment processor.
IBM exec Jerry Cuomo: ""We love blockchain technology because it holds the promise of supporting a very wide variety of industries ... But if you are building a blockhchain that deals with health records or shipping logistics, financial data, or any reference data about products, there are rules regulatory rules and security you have to address.""

Also launched: The DS8888, a flash array meant for mainframes.
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is supplying the high-performance flash memory that goes into IBM?ôs systems, thanks to a multi-year alliance between the firms. Big Blue touts a low minimum latency of 250 microseconds for its systems even with various data services turned on, the inclusion of cloud-friendly features such as multi-tenancy, and a storage cost as low as $1.50/GB thanks to data-reduction features.
Also: IBM says it plans to launch a flash system in Q3 that?ôs aimed at big data/analytics workloads (it?ôs being developed in partnership with SanDisk), and that it will offer a version of the A9000R that can scale out to multiple racks.
The products stem from a commitment (announced in 2013) to invest $1B in flash R&D. IBM, a top player in the flash array market along with EMC, HP Enterprise, and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), is clearly taking flash storage seriously, as a growing number of enterprise and cloud app workloads migrate to SSDs.

Segment performance: IBM has revised its segment reporting structure. Cognitive Solutions (solutions software + transaction processing software) revenue fell 1.7% Y/Y to $4B, with op. margin dropping to 21.8% from 32.6%. Global Business Services revenue -4.3% to $4.1B, with op. margin dropping to 4.5% from 13.2%.Tech Services & Cloud Platforms revenue -1.5% to $8.4B; op. margin dropped to 3% from 13%.

Global Financing revenue -11.2% to $410M; op. margin fell to 43.1% from 49.2%.

Other details:?1) Unlike in prior earnings reports, IBM hasn't broken out its geographic performance or services backlog, or broken out sales growth for various hardware and software businesses. 2) ""Strategic imperatives"" revenue (cloud, analytics, and ""engagement"") rose 14% Y/Y to $7B (compares with a 5% drop in total revenue to $18.7B). 3) The annual ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue run rate (boosted some by M&A) rose 42% Y/Y to $5.4B. 4) Mobile revenue rose 88% Y/Y, security 18%, and analytics 7%. 5) Forex had a 300 bps impact on revenue growth (-5% vs. -2%).

Financials: $900M was spent on buybacks. Thanks partly to the aforementioned expenses, SG&A spend rose 12% Y/Y to $6.01B, and R&D spend 12% to $1.46B. That contributed to a drop in op. margin to 5.5% from 15.3%. Free cash flow was $2.3B, up from $1.1B a year ago. IBM ended Q1 with $14.9B in cash and $18.8B in non-Global Financing debt.

At its GCP Next 2016 cloud user conference, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has unveiled a Cloud Speech API that provides voice recognition services for third-party apps.
The API supports 80+ languages, and can work in either real-time streaming and batch mode. Notably, Google (has made huge A.I./machine learning investments) says the API will rely on the same neural network powering voice search used by Google's search and keyboard apps. It will initially be free to use; Google plans to eventually charge, while offering low-cost pricing tiers.
VR software leader Nuance (NUAN -4.2%), which claims an ecosystem of 30K+ developers, has sold off on the news. In December, Nuance unveiled its Mix platform, which provides developers working on mobile apps and IoT devices with SDKs that can be used to embed voice recognition and text-to-speech functionality.

336,Microsoft takes on Oracle and IBM by bringing SQL Server to Linux,"Mar. 7, 2016, 4:55 PM","

Following years of running only on Windows-based operating systems (mostly Windows Server), Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) SQL Server database will be available for Linux, EVP Scott Guthrie discloses. ""We are bringing the core relational database capabilities to preview today, and are targeting availability in mid-2017.""
Enterprise Linux vendors Red Hat and Canonical provide positive quotes for Guthrie's blog post. Today's announcement follows a deal to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure, as Microsoft continues showing a greater willingness to support rival platforms in the Satya Nadella era. Linux, beloved by many Internet giants and startups, has been steadily gaining server OS share, to a large extent at UNIX's expense.
Bringing SQL Server to Linux represents a salvo fired at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), by far the largest player in the relational database market and long a Linux supporter. Microsoft is also looking to take share from IBM's DB2 and Informix databases, and - though many open-source aficionados will be a tough sell - better compete against open-source databases such as MySQL (controlled by Oracle) and MariaDB.
Guthrie also uses his post to detail new features provided by SQL Server 2016, which arrives on Windows Server later this year and will square off against Oracle's 12c database. Among other things, SQL Server 2016 is said to provide superior encryption features, in-memory database support for every workload (takes aim at both Oracle and SAP's Hana in-memory database), and better data warehousing, business intelligence, predictive analytics, and hybrid cloud support.

344,"More on IBM: Morgan Stanley upgrades, shares jump","Feb. 18, 2016, 10:27 AM","

Believing IBM's (IBM +5.7%) current valuation doesn't reflect the company's efforts to grow its cloud/analytics exposure, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty has upgraded to Overweight and set a $140 target.
Huberty: ""IBM Strategic Imperatives - data, cloud, engagement - now make up 35% of revenue and grew 17% in 2015, or 26% at constant currency, reflecting a faster-than-expected transformation to higher growth / higher value solutions. For comparison, Microsoft Cloud (Azure + Office 365) accounted for 36% of revenue and grew 20% in 2015. Yet IBM's share price reflects a perpetual decline in residual income, and these higher growth categories are undervalued based on our sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis.""
Of note: While IBM's Strategic Imperatives revenue rose 17% in 2015, total revenue fell 9% (1% exc. forex) after adjusting for divestitures. Free cash flow rose by $700M Y/Y to $13.1B, but is forecast to drop to $11B-$12B in 2016.
Regardless, Huberty expects the perceived disconnect between IBM's growth efforts and valuation to correct itself with the help of disclosures at IBM's Feb. 25 analyst day, stabilizing revenue, and improving free cash flow. She goes as far as to argue IBM ""warrants a premium over other hardware companies that haven't invested heavily to transform to new computing paradigms,"" and predicts the company will deliver 2% annual free cash flow growth over the next two years (better than a consensus of -5%).
Following Huberty's upgrade and news of the $2.6B Truven Health Analytics deal, IBM is a large-cap standout on a morning markets are nearly flat. Shares are now up 14% from last Thursday's 52-week low of $116.90. They trade for 9.4x a 2017 EPS consensus of $14.16.

In a big expansion of the company's healthcare bet, IBM's Watson Health unit is buying Truven Health Analytics, a provider of healthcare data and analytics services for healthcare providers, enterprises, governments, and life sciences firms, for $2.6B from investment firm Veritas Capital. The deal is expected to close later this year.
The deal comes six months after one to buy top medical imaging software firm Merge Healthcare, and ten months after the purchases of patient data analysis software firm Phytel and clinical database provider Explorys. The Phytel/Explorys deals coincided with the launch of Watson Health, which aims to provide software/services that can deliver insights from large volumes of anonymized patient data.
Truven has over 8,500 clients, and will boost the size of Watson Health to over 5,000 employees. IBM: ""Upon completion of the acquisition, IBM's health cloud will house one of the world's largest and most diverse collections of health-related data, representing an aggregate of approximately 300 million patient lives acquired from three companies. IBM plans to integrate Truven's extensive cloud-based data set spanning hundreds of different types of cost, claims, quality and outcomes information with its existing data sets.""
Big Blue adds data/insights provided by Truven ""inform benefit decisions for one in three Americans,"" and that Truven's ""cloud-based technology, methodologies and health claims data"" will be integrated with the Watson Health Cloud platform for providing cloud-based healthcare analytics and data sharing.

Citing higher deal risk and weakening NAND fundamentals, CLSA's Mark Heller has downgraded SanDisk (SNDK -1.6%) to Underperform, and cut his target by $16 to $70.
Heller doesn't think weakening fundamentals will unravel Western Digital's (WDC -2.2%) pending cash/stock acquisition of SanDisk, but is worried about the potential for Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiary Unispendour to walk away from its deal to buy a 15% stake in Western for $92.50/share (107% above Western's Friday close).
If Unisplendour was to walk away, Heller sees Western shareholders deciding on the SanDisk deal. The deal calls for Western to pay $85.10 in cash and issue 0.0176 shares for each SanDisk share provided the Unisplendour investment has closed prior to the acquisition. If it hasn't, the cash payout drops to $67.50, and the stock payout rises to 0.2387 shares. SanDisk currently trades below $67; deal closing has been forecast to occur in calendar Q3.

Less than 24 hours after Fortune reported IBM (IBM +1.7%) is in talks to buy live video streaming/delivery platform Ustream, IBM has confirmed the deal. As usual for IBM acquisitions, terms are undisclosed.
IBM: ""[Ustream] streams live and on-demand video to about 80 million viewers per month for customers such as NASA, Samsung, Facebook, Nike and The Discovery Channel ...

Three months ago, IBM (IBM -4.6%) fell towards $140 after providing a 2015 EPS guidance cut to go with mixed Q3 results. Today, shares are almost $20 lower as markets react to the light 2016 guidance - EPS of ""at least"" $13.50, free cash flow of ~$11B-$12B vs. 2015's $13.1B - issued with Big Blue's slight Q4 beat. The S&P is down 0.5%, and the Nasdaq up 0.5%.
Plenty of analyst have (unsurprisingly) cut their targets, but none have downgraded. Aside from forex pressures (expected to hurt 2016 EPS by over $1 as hedges roll off), plenty of concerns have been voiced about IBM's software ops, which were responsible for 46% of the company's 2015 segment op. profit ($9.1B out of $19.7B) and have been hurt by weak deal activity among top-250 clients.
Jefferies' James Kisner (Underperform, $110 target) argues IBM still faces a tough transition as on-premise software and IT services demand continues to be pressured by SaaS/cloud adoption. He also estimates Q4 EPS would've been $4.54 (below a $4.81 consensus) if not for a lower tax rate, and states services signings of $16.7B fell short of a $19.1B consensus.
RBC's Amit Daryanani (Neutral, $135 target): ""Based on tepid EPS/[free cash flow] guide and continued software declines, and System-Z entering the end of the mainframe cycle, we continue to stand on the sidelines."" Drexel Hamilton's Brian White (Buy, $160 target) remains bullish, calling EPS guidance conservative and talking up IBM's 4.1% dividend yield.
Separately, Fortune reports IBM is in advanced talks to buy Ustream, a provider of live video streaming, transcoding, and delivery services for businesses, for $130M in cash + possible earn-out/retention payments. The report follows IBM's December acquisition of cloud video infrastructure service provider Clearleap, which the company plans to integrate with its existing cloud offerings.

Fortune notes IBM and Ustream are already partners, with Ustream's offerings already integrated with IBM's Bluemix cloud app development platform. The startup's customers include Sony and NASA.

360,IBM buys German payment fraud analytics firm IRIS Analytics,"Jan. 15, 2016, 9:45 AM","

Continuing its analytics-related acquisition spree, IBM (IBM -2%) has bought IRIS Analytics, a German provider of software for detecting payment fraud in real-time, investigating fraud cases, and modeling/simulating a company's response to a fraud event. Terms are undisclosed.
IBM: ""IRIS provides a real-time fraud analytics engine that leverages machine learning to generate rapid anti-fraud models while also supporting the creation and modification of ad-hoc models, proven successful on various sized payment platforms ... IRIS serves to bridge the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best fit analytics interactively, while testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.""
Big Blue adds IRIS is used by ""leading banks and payment processors throughout the world,"" and allows fraud countermeasures to be deployed faster than existing techniques relying on ""black box"" models. The purchase follows IBM's 2013 acquisition of malware-protection software firm Trusteer (used by many top banks), and its 2011 purchase of security analytics firm i2 (used by law enforcement agencies and companies to detect illicit activity within operational log data).

Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) could make a bid for storage array vendor NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and threat-prevention hardware/software provider FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) in 2016, thinks FBR's Dan Ives. Cisco/NetApp speculation has been around for a while. Meanwhile, Cisco has made several security acquisitions in recent years, and appears to be up for more, but has also launched products that compete with FireEye.
Ives also thinks IBM could bid for machine/log data analytics software leader Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and business intelligence/data visualization software firm QLIK. With a $7.6B market cap and high multiples, Splunk would be a costlier acquisition than IBM's traditional fare.
HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), meanwhile, is seen as a potential suitor for both Qlik and enterprise cloud storage/file-sharing leader BOX. And Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) a potential buyer of cloud ERP, HR, and e-commerce software firm NetSuite (NYSE:N). Larry Ellison owns a large stake in NetSuite (more SMB-focused than Oracle), and the company both competes and partners with Oracle.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has made plenty of acquisitions in the Satya Nadella era, is seen as a potential buyer of database security software and Web app firewall vendor Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), as well as of cloud vulnerability management and compliance software firm Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).

Germany's WirtschaftsWoche reports (quoting an IBM union rep) IBM (IBM +0.8%) is thinking of laying off up to 3K German workers, or 18% of its local workforce, over the next two years.
A German trade union believes 2,500 of the layoffs are ""relatively fixed,"" with another 500 possible if conditions deteriorate. 1,000-1,200 of the layoffs are expected to come from IBM's slumping consulting and outsourcing ops, which have been pressured by (among other things) cloud services adoption.
Big Blue had a global headcount of 379,592 at the end of 2014, down by over 51K from a year earlier. 38K of the lost jobs stemmed from asset sales such as Lenovo's purchase of IBM's x86 server unit.

As part of the tie-up, IBM will create ""solution stacks"" consisting of Power-based server, storage, and middleware systems using Xilinx acceerators, and also develop and qualify Xilinx accelerator cards for Power-based systems. The alliance comes as Intel, whose Xeon CPUs have been steadily taking share from IBM's Power line, gets set to acquire Xilinx archrival Altera, with plans to offer integrated CPU/FPGA solutions for workload acceleration. In addition to IBM, Xilinx has partnered with Qualcomm, one of several chipmakers going after the budding ARM server CPU market.
Also: 1) IBM claims using Power servers featuring Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tesla K80 GPU-based accelerators can deliver up to a 70% performance boost for certain Watson APIs, and increase its processing power up to 10x. 2) OEMs E4 Computer Engineering and Penguin Computing have unveiled new OpenPower servers. They run on IBM's high-end Power8 CPU and feature Tesla accelerators.

373,"IBM confirms Weather Co. deal, touts cloud/analytics synergies; shares rise (updated)","Oct. 28, 2015, 10:40 AM","

Confirming yesterday evening's WSJ report, IBM (IBM +2.2%) states it's buying The Weather Company's B2B, mobile, and cloud-based Web properties, including Weather.com and Weather Underground, Terms are undisclosed; the WSJ reported of a $2B+ purchase price.
IBM suggests the value of The Weather Co.'s cloud data platform goes well beyond weather, and will bolster both its Watson Cloud platform and a new Watson IoT unit that will provide A.I.-driven analytics services for data produced by Web-connected embedded devices.
IBM: ""The Weather Company's cloud-based data platform will allow IBM to collect an even larger variety and higher velocity of global data sets, store them, analyze them and in turn distribute them and empower richer and deeper insights across the Watson platform ... The Weather Company's mobile and web properties handle seven times the volume of the world's leading search engine, while serving 82 million unique monthly visitors ... [The platform] can ingest a wide range of data at massive speed and scale, supporting an incredible volume of queries at very low latency.""
At the same time, IBM argues weather-related analytics is a major opportunity by itself, given weather's impact on global GDP. It notes The Weather Co.'s models ""analyze data from three billion weather forecast reference points, more than 40 million smartphones, and 50,000 airplane flights per day,"" helping it service ""more than 5,000 clients in the media, aviation, energy, insurance and government industries.""
In August, IBM struck a $1B deal to buy medical imaging software firm Merge Healthcare, with plans to integrate merge with its new Watson Health unit and deliver image analytics services. An IoT-related analytics partnership was formed with CPU core giant ARM in September.
Shares are recovering some of the Tuesday losses seen following an SEC probe disclosure.

Update: Forrester's Ted Schadler offers some thoughts on IBM's motivations for making the deal. ""[B]usinesses need insights services injected into their real-time processes and applications. TWC gives IBM a hugely valuable and differentiated source of data and insights that it can pre-integrate with other major sources, including Twitter sentiment insights and Box's document market. By pre-integrating these data, building predictive and cognitive models on them, and blending them with your data, IBM is in a position to deliver differentiated insights services.""

IBM (IBM -5.8%) is at its lowest levels since 2010 after providing a 2015 EPS guidance cut to go with mixed Q3 results, and reporting continued top-line pressures in many key businesses. A slew of firms have cut their targets, but none have downgraded.
On the earnings call (transcript), CFO Martin Schroeter stated Q3 sales were pressured by a longer-than-expected ""transformation"" timeframe for Global Business Services (GBS) ""as the market shifts away from some of the more traditional application areas"" (due to cloud adoption?), as well as weak storage demand amid growing industry adoption of flash arrays - that's potentially a positive for newly-public flash array vendor/IBM rival Pure Storage (PSTG +2.4%).
Schroeter also mentioned transactional software revenue weakened towards the end of Q3, and that both GBS and transactional challenges will weigh on Q4. GBS revenue fell 13% Y/Y in Q3, storage revenue 19%, and software revenue 10%. Excluding forex, the declines were 5%, 14%, and 3% (suggestive of moderate share loss). Software accounted for 43% of IBM's Q3 op. profit.
Stifel's David Grossman (Buy, target cut by $20 to $160): ""We wonder whether the significant downward revision to guidance reflects an attempt to reset the bar for next year ... We have lowered our 2015 EPS from $15.71 to $14.75 (consensus was $15.67) and 2016 from $16.36 to $15.30 (consensus $16.04), which assumes flattish revenue growth in 2016 (versus down ~1% in 2015) and pretax margin expansion of 60bp (versus down 100bp in 2015). It will be difficult to grow [free cash flow] in 2016 on this EPS base, which suggests the stock could remain in a trading range of high $135-$145, pending the 4Q report.""
Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi (Market Perform, target cut by $10 to $140) thinks 2016 could be even tougher than 2015, given a declining services backlog, the rolloff of currency hedges, a lack of a mainframe/Power system upgrade cycle, lower ""non-operating gains,"" and ongoing strategic investments. He sees EPS dropping to $14.30 in 2016 - revised 2015 guidance is at $14.75-$15.75 - with cash flow ""potentially declining more moderately than EPS.""

Acquisition-hungry IBM's (IBM +3.1%) latest target is Cleversafe, a provider of object storage systems and software. As usual, terms are undisclosed.
Object storage, widely adopted and supported by cloud service providers (many enterprises also use it), requires less overhead for storing content such as documents, photos, and videos, and thus offers better scalability than traditional file and block-based storage systems; it's also easily accessible via HTTP. On the downside, it's less suitable for databases and other frequently-changing content. Amazon's S3 service (over 2T objects stored) is an example of a popular cloud object storage service.
Cleversafe was founded in 2004, and has over 350 patents. Its platform uses proprietary software and algorithms to encrypt, distribute, and retrieve objects stored on commodity hardware, potentially across multiple locations. Clients include photo site Shutterfly and U.K. pay-TV provider Sky. EMC's Atmos object storage business is a rival.
IBM's storage hardware revenue fell 10% Y/Y in Q2, and IDC estimates the company's external disk storage share fell to 11.1% from 12.1% a year earlier; both flash/hybrid storage upstarts and contract manufacturers selling to cloud providers have been gaining share. In February, IBM promised to invest over $1B in storage software over the next 5 years.
Shares are rallying on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.4%, and the S&P 1.6%.

384,"IBM updates cloud app platform, announces $1B cloud deal, discloses carbon nanotube advance","Oct. 1, 2015, 2:54 PM","

IBM (IBM -1.3%) has launched Bluemix Local, a service for its Bluemix cloud app development platform (PaaS) that allows companies to build and run cloud apps behind their internal firewalls - useful for industries with strict data security/compliance policies - and thus enables hybrid clouds covering apps deployed both locally and on IBM's public cloud.
Bluemix's rivals include Microsoft (Azure), Amazon, Salesforce (Heroku), and EMC/VMware's Pivotal unit; Microsoft has strongly emphasized Azure's hybrid cloud abilities. IBM recently updated Bluemix to provide better Java resource support, and has also rolled out a Bluemix-based service for mining Twitter data.
Also: IBM has announced a $1B 10-year cloud services deal with Norwegian IT services provider EVRY. The deal includes cloud infrastructure services delivered by IBM's SoftLayer unit through a Norwegian data center.
Meanwhile, IBM researchers state they've found an improved way to build transistors using carbon nanotubes - long an area of interest for the chip industry, as it looks for ways to prolong Moore's Law beyond this decade - instead of silicon. Big Blue thinks the advance, which involves a way to continue shrinking the width of metal wires connected to nanotubes without increasing electrical resistance, could eventually (likely at some point after 2020) reduce the contact point between wires and nanotube transistors to just 40 atoms in width, and 3 years after that 28 atoms.

385,IBM buying Workday services provider Meteorix,"Sep. 28, 2015, 4:45 PM","


IBM is buying Meteorix, a provider of consulting and implementation services for companies looking to deploy Workday's cloud HR and financials apps. Terms are undisclosed.
""The planned acquisition of Meteorix can make IBM one of the leading, most qualified and experienced Workday service providers in the world,"" says an IBM exec. Workday, which has been taking share from on-premise software alternatives, has an FY16 (ends in January) revenue consensus of $1.16B, and an FY17 consensus of $1.59B. Its clients include a number of U.S. multinationals. Meteorix has 200+ Workday consultants.
Big Blue had 2014 ""cloud revenue"" of $7B. However, that figure includes sales of hardware, software, and services used to enable cloud deployments, and which often came at the expense of on-premise sales. The company's ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue was on a $4.5B/year run rate as of Q2.

386,"IBM, i-banks embrace the blockchain","Sep. 21, 2015, 4:07 PM","

Though Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) remains well off its 4-digit late-2013 highs - Coinbase currently shows Bitcoin selling for less than $229 - major enterprises continue throwing their weight behind the blockchain - the secure public ledger technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

IBM has been working on its own version of the blockchain, with plans to open-source the software when it's finished. Big Blue suggests its solution could be used to secure digital contracts, as well as drive transactions by allowing banks and others to share the same system of record.
In March, Reuters reported IBM has held informal talks with central banks about a cash/payment system that uses the blockchain to drive transactions involving existing currencies, and doesn't require a bank or payment processor (thus lowering transaction fees).
Meanwhile, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, UBS, RBS, and 5 other i-banks have announced plans to work with startup R3CEV to create standards for using the blockchain within the financial industry. RBS exec Kevin Hanley: ""Right now, you?ôre seeing significant money and time being spent on exploration of these technologies in a fractured way that lacks the strategic, coordinated vision so critical to timely success. The R3 [blockchain] model is changing the game,""

StrongLoop provides software tools for creating and managing APIs for apps using the open-source and increasingly popular Node.js runtime environment (used to create server-based Web apps written in JavaScript). IBM (IBM +0.7%) is buying the company for an undisclosed sum.
Big Blue plans to integrate StrongLoop's products with its WebSphere middleware/app server line, as well as with its Bluemix cloud app development platform. IBM: ""Combining StrongLoop's tools and services with IBM's WebSphere and Java capabilities, IBM will help clients bridge Java and Node.js development platforms ... Through integration on IBM Bluemix, these Java and Node.js communities will also have access today to many other IBM and third-party services including access to Mobile Services, data analytics and Watson.""
Back in March, IBM bought A.I./deep learning API provider AlchemyAPI. The company's middleware revenue (covers the WebSphere, Rational, and Tivoli lines, among other products) fell 7% Y/Y in Q2.
Separately, IBM's Watson Health unit (launched in April) has announced partnerships with drugmaker Teva and healthcare R&D outsourcing firm ICON. Both tie-ups involve using the Watson Health Cloud analytics platform to derive insights from large volumes of healthcare-related data.

Update:  Some more Watson Health news: IBM has named Deborah DiSanzo, formerly the CEO of Philips Healthcare, Watson Health's general manager. Big Blue also says it's opening a Watson Health HQ in Cambridge, MA that will house 700+ employees.

390,"IBM, ARM partner on IoT analytics services","Sep. 3, 2015, 3:01 PM","

IBM (IBM +1.3%) is partnering with CPU core giant ARM (ARMH +1.2%) to enable devices supporting ARM's mbed IoT software/services platform to automatically register with IBM's IoT Foundation platform, and thereby access cloud-based IBM analytics services.
IBM: ""This unifies [mbed and IoT Foundation] at the point where information gathered from deployed sensors in any connected device is delivered to the cloud for analysis.? The IoT connection also enables delivery of actionable events to control equipment or provide users with alerts or other information. For example, the triggering of an alarm message on a washing machine to ask the owner to confirm a breakdown engineer appointment if a fault is detected.""
With ARM's CPU cores used by billions of mobile and embedded devices (and billions more on the way), a wide variety of products can be covered. In addition to analytics tools, IBM's IoT Foundation supports the development of cloud apps (through the Bluemix platform) for analyzing IoT-generated data, and security tools for protecting it.
ARM, meanwhile, has followed up on mbed by launching IFC, a framework for quickly creating networks of embedded, Web-connected, ARM-based devices.

391,"Argus upgrades IBM, cites valuation and margin growth potential","Aug. 26, 2015, 1:49 PM","

Noting shares trade at 9.2x 2015E EPS and 8.8x 2016E EPS (compares with a 5-year average of 11.6x), Argus Financial has upgraded IBM (IBM +2.1%) to Buy, while setting a $175 target.
Argus also expects Big Blue to see margin expansion as its sales mix shifts away from commodity offerings to higher-margin software and services tied to ""strategic imperatives"" in fields such as analytics, security, and cloud services. ""[A]t this stage IBM is still rolling off significant low-margin and slow growth business. This transition will be a negative for revenue in the near term and an upturn is still some time away. However, EPS comparisons could turn positive by the end of this year or early next year, depending on end-market conditions.""
Consensus is for EPS to drop to $15.73 this year from 2014's $16.53, before rising to $16.13 in 2016. Revenue, affected by forex, hardware/services weakness, and the x86 server unit sale, is expected to drop 10.6% in 2015 and 0.6% in 2016.
Separately, IBM has made a few cloud-related product announcements. 1) IBM's Bluemix cloud app platform (PaaS) has been updated to better support Java tools and resources. 2) Cloud management software from Blue Box (acquired earlier this year) can now be used to manage private clouds at IBM data centers. 3) IBM's Spectrum Protect backup software (competes against the likes of Symantec and CommVault) now supports direct cloud backups.

392,"IBM launches Linux-only mainframes, offers pay-as-you-go pricing","Aug. 17, 2015, 2:55 PM","

While IBM (IBM +0.1%) has supported Linux on its System z mainframes for 15 years, its new LinuxONE systems are the first mainframes to exclusively run on the open-source OS, and thus eschew IBM's proprietary z/OS.
A high-end mainframe called LinuxONE Emperor (named after the penguin) supports up to 8K virtual machines or hundreds of thousands of lightweight app containers. The less powerful LinuxONE Rockhopper (ditto) is said to be ""designed for clients and emerging markets seeking the speed, security and availability of the mainframe but in a smaller package.""
Like System z mainframes, LinuxONE supports Red Hat (RHT +0.5%) and SUSE's Linux distributions, while also adding support for Canonical's Ubuntu Linux distribution. Big Blue also promises to support a slew of open-source software tools/platforms popular with Linux users, such as MariaDB (database), Apache Spark (in-memory big data engine, an area of interest for IBM), and Docker (container platform).
Notably, IBM will offer subscription-based/pay-as-you-go pricing options for LinuxONE, as it tries to win over businesses worried about the traditional up-front costs of deploying a mainframe.
Thanks to an upgrade cycle, IBM's mainframe revenue rose 9% Y/Y in Q2 and 118% in Q1, after falling sharply in 2014. After adjusting for the highs and lows of cycles, servers based on Intel's Xeon CPUs have been gradually taking share from mainframes for years.

397,"IBM -6.3%; Street cuts estimates, debates turnaround after mixed Q2","Jul. 21, 2015, 3:01 PM","

With IBM's Q2 EPS benefiting from a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.2% (down 280 bps Q/Q and 330 bps Y/Y), many firms are cutting their full-year EPS estimates on account of Big Blue's top-line pressures. However, no downgrades have arrived.
Janney's Joseph Foresi (Neutral): ""Strategic-Imperative revenue growing more than 30% y/y was impressive, but implies a worse than expected performance in the legacy business. Most segments were close to flat in either direction, and we see little prospect of overall y/y growth until 2016."" Likewise, Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold) continues to forecast ""secular challenges related to the shift to the cloud to be a negative headwind for IBM and [expects] near-term growth to be difficult.??
JPMorgan's Tien-tsin Huang (Neutral) is worried about services margins. ""[Services] signings were up nicely; backlog was up 1% (first increase since end of 2013), as IBM encouragingly won 22 large deals. However, services pretax margins deteriorated 390 basis points year/year ... Given forex is essentially neutral to margin % on pretax basis, we attribute much of this margin deterioration to need for investments in Strategic Imperatives which should continue and hurt near term Services margins.""
Stifel's David Grossman (Buy) makes a bull case centered around low multiples, services backlog conversion, and a software business believed to be faring better than generally believed. ""IBM is trading at 13 times 2015 free cash flow, which includes $0.80/share of forex-related headwinds and represents a 25% discount to the S&P earnings multiple. In our view, this stock offers attractive risk/reward given the various headwinds.""
On the CC (transcript), CFO Martin Schroeter stated IBM's mobile-related sales (benefiting from the Apple partnership?) quadrupled in 1H15, and that demand for scale-out systems is giving a lift to Power server sales (weak in recent years, but down only 1% in Q2). 25% and 16% Y/Y drops in Chinese and Brazilian revenue hurt BRIC revenue in Q2, and a fresh $200M ""workforce rebalancing"" charge was taken.

Tangoe (OTC:TNGO) sold off today after slightly missing Q1 revenue estimates (while posting in-line EPS) and offering mixed guidance.
The company has also announced it's buying IBM's Emptoris Rivermine telecom expense management (TEM) software business for an undisclosed sum. Tangoe declares Emptoris has a ""global blue chip customer base,"" and complements its Matrix suite of cloud telecom asset/expense management apps. The deal is expected to close at month's end.
Q2 guidance is for revenue of $56.5M-$57.5M and EPS of $0.18-$0.19 vs. a consensus of $58.4M and $0.19. Full-year guidance is for revenue of $245M-$250M and EPS of $0.73-$0.78 vs. a consensus of $239.7M and $0.79. Emptoris (naturally isn't factored into estimates) is expected to boost Q2 and full-year revenue by $1M and $10M, and hurt EPS by $0.01 and $0.04.
Tangoe blames the Q1 sales miss on ""quarter-to-quarter variability of non-recurring revenue,"" while insisting it's ""the less strategic component of our business.""

 Less than 2 months after launching cloud-based analytics services for mining Twitter data, IBM (IBM -1.9%) is partnering with Facebook (FB +1.1%) to deliver improved marketing/targeting tools for Facebook ad clients. IBM, which has made several marketing software acquisitions over the last few years, will provide analytics and cloud-based marketing apps that give clients deeper insights into users being shown ads via Facebook targeting tools such as Custom Audiences (enables targeting based on both Facebook and non-Facebook activity), and help them design and run personalized ad campaigns covering Facebook and other channels. IBM: ""[A] retailer launching a new line of running gear can use Facebook's Custom Audiences and targeting solutions to segment its customer groups that are interested in long-distance running. The retailer can then glean aggregated insights into the audience's preferences in running gear and, based on location, offer deals on apparel that fit the appropriate training climate."" Separately, Oculus has announced a commercial version of the Oculus Rift VR headset will launch in Q1 2016, with pre-orders starting later in 2015. The Facebook unit states the commercial model will improve upon Oculus' 2014 Crescent Bay prototype through ""an improved tracking system that supports both seated and standing experiences, as well as a highly refined industrial design, and updated ergonomics for a more natural fit."" Details about hardware, software, input, and game support will be given shortly. Samsung plans to launch a consumer-focused version of its Oculus-based Gear VR headset (relies on a phone's display and camera, currently aimed at developers and early adopters) by year's end. Oculus is widely seen as having an early tech lead over VR rivals such as Sony and HTC.  "

 Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new Xeon E7 v3 server CPU line follows the Sep. 2014 launch of the company's Xeon E5 v3 (Grantley) line. Whereas Grantley is aimed at smaller servers (1-4 CPUs) going into distributed HPC systems or hyperscale Web/cloud data centers, the E7 v3 line is aimed at high-end/mission-critical servers running up to 32 CPUs. Like Grantley, E7 CPUs are made using Intel's 22nm Haswell architecture and support up to 18 cores (the prior-gen E7 v2 supports up to 15) able to run two threads at a time. With an eye towards catering to memory-intensive analytics and in-memory database workloads (a rapidly growing market segment), the chips support up to 45MB of Level 3 cache and up to 1.5TB of DRAM per CPU socket (Intel claims this is an industry high). 17 OEMs, including HP, Dell, Cisco, Lenovo, and Oracle, plan to launch E7 v3 servers. Intel is counting on the CPUs to take further high-end share from RISC CPU lines such as Oracle's SPARC and IBM's Power. IBM is trying to drive a rebound in Power sales by licensing the platform to 3rd-party OEMs and CPU developers; its massive Power8 CPUs support up to 12 cores and 8 threads/core. Analyst Patrick Moorhead argues Intel is ""closing the gap"" with RISC vendors on the high-end with its latest offerings. ""If you want the absolutely highest performance on SAP, you would look to IBM, but it comes with some caveats. The big difference comes in performance per dollar, where Intel-based systems from HP, Dell, or Lenovo could perform better by 5-10x versus an IBM Power-based system.""  "

With a Q1 EPS beat in tow, IBM is reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $15.75-$16.50 (compares with a $15.89 consensus). Big Blue also still expects free cash flow to be flat relative to a 2014 level of $12.4B.
Forex had an 8% impact on Y/Y revenue growth, up from Q4's 4.4%. Divestments had a 4% impact.
Helping EPS beat estimates in spite of a revenue miss: 1) Gross margin rose 80 bps Y/Y to 49.3%. 2) Non-GAAP SG&A spend fell 18% Y/Y to $5B, and R&D spend fell 9% to $1.3B (forex and divestments played a role). 3) $1.2B was spent on buybacks.

Segment performance: Global tech services revenue -11% Y/Y to $7.9B; op. profit of $994M. Global business services -13% to $4.3B; op. profit of $597M. Software -8% to $5.2B; op profit of $1.94B. Hardware -23% to $1.7B; op. profit of? $24M. Financing -10% to $0.5B; op. profit of $515M.

Geographic performance: Americas revenue -3% to $9.3B (+2% adjusted for forex and asset sales). EMEA -19% to $6.1B (-2% adjusted). Asia-Pac -18% to $4.1B (-2% adjusted).
The services backlog fell by $17B Y/Y to $121B; IBM says it's flat on an adjusted basis. Hardware revenue was up 30% adjusted for forex and the x86 server division sale, thanks to a 118% increase System z mainframe revenue (upgrade cycle). Power systems revenue fell 3%, a smaller drop than in recent quarters; storage revenue fell 8%. Within software, middleware fell 5%.
Free cash flow was $1.1B, trailing net income of $2.9B. ""Cloud delivered as a service"" revenue is now on a $3.8B/year run rate, up $500M Q/Q. Analytics revenue rose 12% Y/Y.

IBM -0.4% AH to $165.50. Shares rose 3.4% in regular trading ahead of the report, aided by a market rally and possibly an upbeat Barron's column.

IBM is posting solid gains ahead of this afternoon's Q1 report. 2M shares have been traded thus far vs. a 3-month daily average of 4.6M. The S&P is up 1%, and the Nasdaq 1.2%.
A positive weekend column from Barron's'? Vito Racanelli might be helping Big Blue's cause. Racanelli: ""Expectations and sentiment for the Armonk, N.Y.-based tech giant seem so low now that it?ôs time to take a second look ... Like a supertanker, IBM takes a while to change direction but there?ôs identifiable change coming.""
He takes issue with the image of IBM as a tech dinosaur that has missed out on the cloud services boom, and observes its cloud revenue grew 60% in 2014 to $7B. Worth noting: IBM's definition of ""cloud revenue"" also covers ancillary products/services. Its ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue totaled $3B in 2014, and was on a $3.5B/year run rate at year's end.
Racanelli also highlights IBM's 2.7% dividend yield, low multiples, investments in other growth markets, and passes on upbeat remarks from two fund managers, one of whom sees the company benefiting from a server upgrade cycle - the System z mainframe line was recently refreshed.
Last week, Credit Suisse (a long-time bear) forecast a slight Q1 miss thanks to forex pressures, and also voiced concerns about order/deal softness, internal turmoil/underinvestment, and the margin impact of a shift towards cloud revenue streams.
IBM is up 6% since providing mixed Q4 results and light 2015 guidance on Jan. 20.

Terms are undisclosed.
IBM declares Phytel will help it give healthcare providers ""insights into patient health from data about patient behaviors and their engagement with care plans,"" and that Explorys will ""accelerate the delivery of IBM Health Cloud and IBM Watson cognitive solutions to model and apply medical evidence and large scale analytics to data.""
Both companies are being added to a new Watson Health unit based out of Boston. The business aims to provide software/services that can surface insights from large volumes of anonymous personal health data.

Following an NYT column featuring remarks from exec Bill Hilf that that were taken to suggest HP (NYSE:HPQ) is exiting the public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, HP has told CRN it remains committed to the space. However, the IT giant adds (echoing Hilf's remarks) it's ""not competing head-to-head with the big public cloud players,"" such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
HP's comments follow the February departure of top cloud exec Marten Mickos (joined via the Eucalyptus acquisition), and the splitting of his responsibilities between Hilf and two other execs. The company entered the public cloud market in 2012, and (like many other enterprise IT firms) has been a backer of the OpenStack IaaS platform (pitched as an open-source alternative to Amazon/Google/Microsoft's proprietary offerings). HP asserts it has the largest OpenStack public cloud in existence.
HP's stance arguably highlights the challenges traditional enterprise IT names face in countering the cost and scale advantages possessed by IaaS market leaders, who have often eschewed the hardware of IT giants in favor of cheap white-label hardware produced by Asian contract manufacturers. HP has partnered with Taiwan's Foxconnn and Accton to offer white-box gear for cloud providers.
Synergy Research estimates the broader ""cloud infrastructure service"" market (covers IaaS and PaaS, as well as private and hybrid clouds) grew 48% in 2014 to $16B, as more on-premise workloads get migrated to cloud environments and various cloud service providers relying on IaaS/PaaS infrastructures see rapid growth. Amazon towered over the space with a near-30% share, close to 3x that of #2 Microsoft. IBM, Google, and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rounded out the top 5.

With Apple Watch set to ship next month, leading high-end Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer plans to launch a watch that runs on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear platform, and is powered by an Intel (INTC +0.1%) CPU.
The PR provides few details about the watch, but Reuters reports the product will be a version of Tag's bestselling Carrera line, and launch next autumn. With Carerra watches often priced above $2K, the deal will likely be more valuable to Intel as a reference win - the vast majority of early smartwatch launches have involved ARM-based CPUs - than as a revenue-generator.
Intel is going after the wearables market by pitching its Atom CPUs for relatively powerful devices, and its tiny Quark CPUs for less resource-hungry products where battery life is a priority. It has also launched Curie, a button-sized module containing a Quark CPU, flash memory, Bluetooth radio, and sensor hub. The company has a partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica, and has reportedly landed a design win for the next version of Google Glass.
Separately, IBM (IBM +0.2%) has announced the first OpenPower servers - servers running on IBM's Power CPUs (compete against Intel's Xeon line), but which can be made by 3rd-party OEMs and could sell for much less than IBM's Power-based servers historically have - will launch in Q2 and be sold by Taiwanese manufacturer Tyan. IBM plans to offer its own OpenPower servers later this year in partnership with Taiwan's Wistron; they'll be aimed at the high-performance computing (HPC) market.
Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, and Rackspace are among the companies that have given their support to OpenPower. IBM is both hoping to halt Power's long-term share losses to Intel, and grab a bigger share of an Internet/white-box server market (dominated by Intel systems) that accounts for a large and growing portion of global server spend.

Nearly 5 months after announcing an enterprise analytics alliance with Twitter (TWTR +1.4%), IBM (IBM -0.1%) has launched a slew of cloud-based services for enterprises and developers looking to mine Twitter data for insights and/or fuse it with other data sources.
Among other things, IBM has rolled out a service on its Bluemix cloud app platform that lets developers/businesses ""search, quickly explore and then mine enriched Twitter content and aggregated insights,"" and a service for its Watson Analytics platform that can ""give business professionals the ability to immediately pull Twitter data into any project in order to help identify and explain hidden patterns and relationships.""
Also: The cloud-based version of IBM's BigInsights software for the popular Hadoop big data framework can now be obtained with ""pre-configured access to Twitter content."" IBM claims 4K+ professionals have been trained to work with Twitter data and combine it with other sources.
Sample use cases include correlating angry Tweets with weather events and customer defections for telecom companies, drawing a link between retail employee turnover and lost customers, and using Tweet sentiment to better gauge fashion demand. IDC's David Schubmehl argues IBM's industry-specific expertise (also a reason why Apple partnered with IBM) gives it an edge in such use cases, as it battles against Oracle, Salesforce, and other software vendors providing social media analytics tools.
For Twitter, IBM's tools burnish the company's credentials as a source for valuable business data, and could provide a boost to its data licensing sales. Twitter's data licensing/other revenue rose 105% Y/Y in Q4 to $47M (10% of total revenue).

Reuters reports IBM is working on a digital cash/payment system that would rely on the blockchain - the transaction ledger technology that underpins Bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) and other virtual currencies - to enable transactions for major currencies that don't require a bank or payment processor, thus lowering fees.
Big Blue has reportedly ""been in informal discussions about a blockchain-tied cash system with a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve."" If central banks approve, IBM will ""build the secure and scalable infrastructure for the project.""
A source: ""When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a Bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars. It's sort of a Bitcoin but without the Bitcoin.""
Bitcoin's support for transaction fees far lower than those charged by credit card processors (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) and traditional online payment platforms (e.g. PayPal) has led many big online merchants to support the virtual currency. However, Bitcoin's tremendous volatility - after peaking above $1,100 in late 2013, Bitcoin now trades below $300 - has scared off many would-be users.
In theory, IBM's offering would provide the transaction cost benefits of Bitcoin, while allowing consumers to rely on dollars, euros, yen, etc. The reported solution could be linked to a user's bank account via digital wallet software.
Also: Whereas Bitcoin is completely decentralized, central banks would serve as overseers for the IBM-backed currency system. ""These coins will be part of the money supply,"" says Reuters' source. ""It's the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain.""

Likewise, IDC estimates global enterprise storage revenue rose 7.2% Y/Y in Q4, aided by Web investments and healthy demand for mid-range systems featuring integrated flash. Q3 growth was pegged at 5.1%.

IBM had a rough time its both the server and storage markets: IDC believes its storage share fell to 9% (tied for #3) from 12.7% a year earlier, and Gartner estimates its server revenue fell 14% if one excludes Big Blue's x86 server unit, which was just sold to Lenovo. After accounting for the x86 sale, IDC estimates IBM's server share was at 13.7% (#3) vs. 26.8% a year ago.
HP (NYSE:HPQ) fared a little better: IDC has its server share falling fractionally to 26.8% (still #1 overall), and its storage share falling to 13.8% (#2)  from 14.1%. The company's x86 server unit has been gaining ground against IBM's former business, but its high-end server sales remain weak.
Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) UCS server line (recently refreshed) continues to gain ground: Its share rose to 5.3% (#5)  from 4.5%, with full-year revenue pegged at $2.9B. With the help of aggressive pricing and x86 growth, Dell's server share rose to 16.7% (#2) from 15.2%, while its storage share slipped to 9% (tied for #3) from 9.2%. Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) claimed a 7.6% server share (#4) thanks to the IBM deal, kicking Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) out of the top-5 along the way.
EMC, whose high-end storage sales have been pressured (mid-range/flash demand has been better), saw its storage share drop to 22.2% (still #1) from 23.1%. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), which posted an FQ3 miss and light guidance last month amid tough mid-range competition from EMC and others, saw its share drop to 7.2% (#5) from 8%.
Not surprisingly, the white-label hardware beloved by Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. continued to take share. IDC estimates such hardware, referred to as ODM Direct, claimed server and storage shares of 8.2% and 12.8% vs. 6.4% and 9.9% a year ago.
Sales of x86 servers, the lion's share of which run on Intel CPUs, rose 7.1% to $11.5B. Sales of non-x86 servers fell 14% to $3B, thanks to declining demand for both mainframes and UNIX servers running proprietary RISC CPUs. ""Early-stage revenue"" was seen for ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) servers, largely via HP's Moonshot line.

Bloomberg reports production of a 12.9"" iPad (NASDAQ:AAPL) is ""now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels."" Sources state Apple previously planned to start production in calendar Q1.
The larger iPad is expected to be aimed at enterprises and creative pros - there have been rumors of a stylus accessory for it - and bolster a business sales push that already includes partnerships with IBM and various indie developers to create enterprise-focused iOS apps. On Monday, IBM launched new iOS apps aimed at banking/financial services, retail, and travel/transportation clients.
While iPhone and Mac sales have been growing, the iPad has been a weak spot for Apple lately: iPad sales have been down Y/Y during the last four quarters, and fell 22% in FQ1 (the December quarter).

IBM has acquired AlchemyAPI, a provider of software APIs for companies looking to add A.I./deep learning capabilities to their apps. Terms are undisclosed.

AIchemy offers both cloud-based and on-premise versions of its API offerings, which cover image and text analysis tools. The company asserts its platform ""makes it easy to create smart apps that deeply understand the world's conversations, reports and photos.""
IBM plans to integrate Alchemy's deep learning tech with its Watson A.I. hardware/software platform, declaring it will strengthen ""Watson's ability to quickly identify hierarchies and understand relationships within large volume data sets."" Big Blue also states the deal will ""greatly expand the number and types of scalable cognitive computing APIs"" available to clients, developers, and partners.
The IT giant stated last year it wants Watson to produce $10B in revenue within 10 years - all signs suggest it has a ways to go. IBM rolled out the cloud-based Watson Analytics service last year to good reviews, as well as a cloud app development platform (Bluemix) that supports Watson services and APIs. It also bought a virtual assistant startup (Cognea) to help Watson deliver ""conversational services.""

IBM (IBM -0.6%) uses its 2015 analyst day (webcast) to declare it's looking to generate $40B in 2018 revenue from cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security solutions, up from $25B (27% of total revenue) in 2014.
To help achieve the goal, Big Blue plans to shift another $4B in spending in 2015 towards the businesses in question; the company is just a week removed from committing $1B over the next 5 years to storage software investments. Nonetheless, the size of the 2018 target suggests major new acquisitions are a possibility.
Of note: IBM often has very broad definitions of what it considers to be revenue attached to a growth business. For example, ""cloud"" revenue might not just cover cloud software and infrastructure services, but also sales of servers, databases, IT services, etc. that went towards a cloud deployment. Thus, while IBM's 2014 ""cloud revenue"" totaled $7B, its ""cloud delivered as a service revenue"" was only $3B.
IBM is also reiterating guidance (provided with its Jan. 20 Q4 report) for 2015 EPS of $15.75-$16.50, and for free cash flow to be ""consistent"" with a 2014 level of $12.37B. However, it now expects forex to respectively have a 7%+ and 6%+ impact on Q1 and full-year sales growth, more than previously forecast.

""IBM (IBM +1.5%) does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,"" says Big Blue in response to a report it's laying off over 110K workers. ""If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements ... they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.""
IBM adds it currently has ~15K job openings worldwide, and that it ""continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace.""
Workers' union Alliance@IBM suggests taking a cautious view of the report. ""Various members of the media are picking up on Robert Cringley's assertion that 100,000 IBMers will lose their jobs next week in a massive reorg at IBM. The Alliance has no information that this is true ... But as you all know, anything can happen at IBM anymore and this is the time of year that IBM cuts jobs.""
Though IBM has carried out plenty of layoffs in recent years, 110K+ workers would be a far larger restructuring move than anything previously launched. As Hong Kong's The Standard notes, a $600M charge likely covers the layoff of several thousand workers.
The Register reported earlier this month IBM is planning a big reorg that will see the company ""try to shed [its] dusty hardware, software and services silo structure.""

Not surprisingly, many sell-side firms are cutting their IBM (IBM -3.3%) estimates after the IT giant provided light 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance to go with mixed Q4 results. Shares are less than $1.50 removed from a 52-week low of $150.50.
Goldman's Bill Shope: ""We were discouraged by both fourth-quarter results and 2015 guidance ... We believe 2015 will be another transition year, and we expect the company to provide a road map for recovery in 2016 and beyond at its analyst day next month.""
JPMorgan's Tien-tsin Huang is worried about weakening software sales (-6.6% Y/Y in Q4, responsible for a large % of op. profit), and says he's taking a ""wait-and-see approach"" to how Big Blue grows cash flow.
Citi's Jim Suva wants to see stabilizing sales and organic EPS growth before turning bullish. ""Given the rapid rate of innovation within the competitive landscape, we are not convinced IBM fully grasps the severity of these competitive dynamics.""
On the CC (transcript), CFO Martin Schroeder attributed IBM's 60 bps Y/Y gross margin gain to better services margins and the x86 server unit sale. He added IBM's 2015 EPS guidance assumes a 20% tax rate, and ""a 2 to 3 point impact from share repurchase"" (implies less buybacks than in 2014).

TechCrunch reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is interested in acquiring Softcard, the mobile payments platform launched by AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in 2010 - it was previously known as Isis, before changing its name for obvious reasons. Though Softcard's owners have invested hundreds of millions in the venture, sources state Google's purchase price could be below $100M.
Like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Softcard relies on NFC radios to enable transactions. And like Wallet, it has struggled to get off the ground, as U.S. consumers overwhelmingly stick with card swipes. Hard data on Apple Pay usage remains limited for now.
Softcard recently laid off 60 employees. Meanwhile, it was reported in 2013 that Google had spent $300M on Wallet-related acquisitions, with little to show for it. The adoption of EMV (chip-and-PIN) readers by U.S. retailers could give NFC solutions a boost, by making card payments a little less convenient.

The WSJ reports Google is partnering with consulting giant PwC to bid on a $2B+ contract to update the DoD's electronic health records system. PwC says Google's tools could both improve the system's security and performance, and lower costs. A group featuring IBM, HP (NYSE:HPQ), and CSC has made a rival bid.

The z13, declared by IBM (with typical enterprise sales boastfulness) to be ""the most powerful and secure system ever built,"" is the first major refresh for the System z mainframe line since 2012. It supports up to 141 CPU units - a custom 8-core CPU is used - 10TB of memory, and 8K virtual servers. (datasheet - .pdf)
Other features include faster/more reliable I/O connectivity, cryptography and compression co-processors for each CPU, and architecture changes meant to boost analytics workload performance. Like other System z hardware, it runs both Linux and IBM's proprietary z/OS (updated to offer faster analytics and data serving). IBM claims the z13 can handle 2.5B transactions/day.
The refresh doesn't come a moment too soon: IBM's hardware division sales fell 15% Y/Y in Q3 amid share losses to HP, Dell, EMC, and many smaller rivals. With customers waiting for a new model, System z sales fell 35%. Hardware sales, of course, drive a sizable amount of software/services revenue.
Though IBM's mainframe line still claims a large enterprise/government base that swears by its scalability, reliability, and partitioning features, x86 servers have been steadily gaining ground against proprietary platforms. HP recently launched x86 hardware for its rival Superdome and NonStop server lines, and age-old mainframe competitor Unisys (NYSE:UIS) is embracing x86 as well.

Jefferies, Deutsche, and Stifel have slashed their 2015 IBM (IBM -1.9%) estimates. Shares are underperforming on a down day for equities.
Jefferies' James Kisner (Underperform) has cut his 2015 revenue and EPS estimates to $87B and $15.85 from $89.75B and $16.30, while citing a strong dollar. His Q4 estimates have been cut to $24.6B and $5.27, below a consensus of $24.93B and $5.48.
""We believe revenue growth will be significantly challenged for IBM over the next few years,"" says Deutsche's Sherri Scribner, cutting her 2015 EPS estimate by $0.40 to $15.90. She notes cloud revenue (on a $3B/year run rate) is only ~3% of total sales, and that? free cash flow has trailed GAAP EPS during the last three years (previous).
Stifel's David Grossman has cut his 2015 EPS estimate all the way to $15.17, but maintains a Buy. ""Headwinds from the hardware business should abate as 2015 progresses and product issues are being addressed; the cyclical issues are harder to predict, but comparisons get much easier in 2015, particularly in the second half.""
The estimate cuts follow a report from The Register stating CEO Ginny Rometty is planning a major reorg ""that will see IBM try to shed the dusty hardware, software and services silo structure."" Microsoft did something similar in 2013.
IBM's main post-reorg units will reportedly ""include Research, Sales & Delivery, Systems, Global Technology Services, Cloud, Watson, Security, Commerce, [and] Analytics.""

Hoping to differentiate itself from Microsoft, Google, and other business e-mail rivals, IBM has launched Verse, an e-mail solution that integrates calendar data, IMs, social media updates, video chats, and file-sharing tools. The product will be offered both through the Web, and via Android/iOS apps, on a freemium basis.
Verse relies on integrated analytics to learn a user's priorities, and to quickly provide important material (e-mails or otherwise) in an ""at-a-glance"" view. IBM will also include an option to conduct Watson queries (previous).
Exec Carolyn Pampino says IBM is trying to differentiate Verse by having ""more of a focus on people"" and relevant conversations than rival solutions. ""[Verse is] an easy and fast way to immediately filter on a person?ôs name.""

Nonetheless, competitors are gaining ground. Synergy thinks Microsoft (MSFT +0.9%), which saw 128% Y/Y Commercial Cloud growth in Q3 (covers both Azure and other services), saw its share rise above 10%. IBM (IBM -0.1%), which reported an 80% Y/Y Q3 increase in ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue, is assigned a 7% share. Google, Salesforce, and Rackspace are close behind.
In a PR, IBM states Synergy declared it to be ""the #1 hybrid and private cloud provider for the enterprise."" Big Blue has committed $1.2B to building up to 15 new data centers from which to deliver IaaS/PaaS services.
Hybrid clouds are also pivotal to Microsoft's efforts to gain ground against Amazon. Last month, the company unveiled a new hardware platform (to be sold by Dell) that can handle Azure private cloud services, and link with Microsoft's public cloud services to create a hybrid cloud.
Synergy thinks industry IaaS/PaaS revenue rose 49% Y/Y on a rolling annualized basis, and that trailing 12-month revenue has topped $14.5B. IDC expects public IT cloud services revenue (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) to post a 22.8% CAGR from 2014-2018, growing from $56.6B to over $127B.

After badly missing Q3 EPS estimates (in spite of backing out the losses of its soon-to-be-sold chip unit), IBM (IBM -6.7%) guided on its Q3 CC for 2014 EPS from continuing ops. to be down 2%-4% Y/Y. That implies a range of $15.97-$16.30, soundly below a $17.87 consensus.
Big Blue also says it took a $3.3B Q3 post-tax charge related to the chip business; the figure includes the $1.5B payment to Globalfoundries.
During a CNBC interview, CEO Ginny Rometty suggested fresh layoffs are on tap. The company recorded a $1B workforce rebalancing charge back in Q1; its headcount was at 431K at the end of 2013.
IBM's closely-watched services backlog fell 7% Y/Y in Q3 to $128B, a much sharper drop than Q2's 1%; the company declares it saw ""insufficient"" services productivity. Also worrying investors: Gross margin fell 90 bps to 49.2%, ending a long string of Y/Y gains.
Other pressures on EPS: 1) The non-GAAP tax rate rose 80 bps Q/Q and 320 bps Y/Y to 20.8%. 2) Buybacks fell to $1.7B from Q2's $3.7B. 3) Opex for continuing ops rose 2% Y/Y, while revenue from continuing ops fell 4% (helps explain the job cut talk).
Hardware revenue (excludes chips) -15% Y/Y; software -2%; global tech services -3%; global business services -2%; financing -3%. Within hardware: Mainframes -35%; Power systems -12%; x86 servers (just sold to Lenovo) -10%; storage -6%.
Two strong points: ""Cloud delivered as a service"" revenue is up over 80% YTD ($3.1B/year run rate), and security revenue is up over 20% YTD.
Americas revenue -2%; EMEA -2%; Asia-Pac -9%. ""Growth markets"" -6%, with BRIC countries down 7%.

Bloomberg previously reported IBM's talks with Globalfoundries broke down over price, but didn't state Globalfoundries was looking to be paid for making the acquisition. It added IBM was interested in a JV agreement that would allow it to retain control of chip design and IP development.
Analyst Jim McGregor thinks a deal might still happen. ""The first rule of negotiating anything is you need to be able to walk away from a deal ... This might just be posturing. You may see this resurrect itself in three to six months.""

487,IBM-licensed servers take aim at Intel's server CPU dominance,"Jul. 28, 2014, 7:22 PM","

3rd-party servers based on IBM's Power architecture will hit the market in early 2015, says IBM exec Ken King. He adds the first Power systems will be aimed at cloud and high-end applications. They'll run on Big Blue's Power8 CPUs.
3rd-party Power CPUs are also expected in time. IBM first announced plans to license Power to third parties a year ago. The company's own Power server sales have been plunging amid a broader decline in UNIX and non-x86 server demand; they fell 28% Y/Y in Q2.
Early supporters for IBM's effort include Nvidia, Samsung, Micron, and most notably Google, which (like other Web giants) buys huge quantities of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs to power its servers. Power8's proponents claim big performance gains relative to Intel's x86 Xeon CPUs; individual Power8 chips can feature 12 cores and support up to 96 threads.
King says Google, known for its obsession with performance and power efficiency, could be intrigued by the fact Power can support more virtual machines than x86. As with the budding ARM server CPU market, software support will take some time.
Intel, whose server CPU unit towers over the market and is coming off a strong Q2, is trying to counter the Power/ARM threats both by rolling out new low-power Atom server CPUs, and by expanding its custom chip work for Internet clients. Upcoming products will offer more customization by placing an FPGA and a Xeon CPU in the same package.

The news service reported in June IBM and Globalfoundries were close to a deal, while adding (citing a source) Big Blue's chip unit has been losing as much as $1.5B/year. Before that, the WSJ reported IBM originally wanted $2B+ for the business, but had seen initial bids closer to $1B.
The unit's sales fell 18% Y/Y in Q2 amid ongoing share losses to TSMC and other foundry rivals. They fell 16% in Q1, and 33% in Q4.
Bloomberg states IBM had become interested in a JV arrangement that would allow it to maintain control of chip design and IP development (while ridding itself of manufacturing). Two weeks ago, IBM promised to spend $3B over the next 5 years on advanced chip R&D.

IBM's (IBM - unchanged) Q2 hardware sales (-11% Y/Y vs. -23% in Q1,) ""delivered meaningful upside"" to Cantor's estimates, says analyst Brian White, while reiterating a Buy. Favorable comps and healthy mainframe/storage demand allowed the hardware unit to grow 39% Q/Q, or more than twice historical seasonal growth.
White also thinks IBM's Chinese revenue (-11%, hurt by NSA issues) has bottomed out. On the CC (transcript), IBM said it saw ""a pretty good sequential improvement"" in China and India, though it added other parts of Asia-Pac remained weak.
Citi's Jim Suva is less enthusiastic than White: He observes a one-time asset gain boosted EPS by $0.10, that Global Business Services outsourcing (-9%) remains weak due to price pressure and contract negotiations, and that services signings are down 33% (partly due to tough comps). He also notes mainframe growth isn't expected to continue.
Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha, meanwhile, has doubts about ""the quality"" of IBM's forecast for $20 in 2015 EPS, given ""results continue to be driven less by revenue growth and more by non-operational items.""
Some bright spots: 1) With the help of SoftLayer, IBM's ""cloud delivered as a service"" revenue is now on a $2.8B run rate. That's roughly equal to 3% of total revenue. 2) Ahead of the Apple deal, ""mobile revenue"" (a nebulous term) is up over 100% YTD.

515,WSJ: Globalfoundries the top candidate to buy IBM's chip foundry ops,"Apr. 3, 2014, 4:43 PM","

Private Globalfoundries is ""the lead candidate"" to acquire IBM's (IBM -0.4%) struggling chip manufacturing/foundry ops, sources tell the WSJ. Market leader TSMC (TSM -0.5%) is said to have dropped out of talks, and though Intel is said to be involved, Globalfoundries is showing more interest.
Sources add a deal isn't imminent, and that price remains an issue: IBM originally wanted $2B+ for the business, whose sales tumbled 33% Y/Y in Q4 (evidence of share loss) and is in the midst of seeing layoffs, but initial bids have only been north of $1B.
The business was first reported to be on the block in early February. Bernstein has estimated it had 2013 revenue of $1.75B, and an op. loss of $130M.
Though presenting integration challenges, acquiring IBM's chip unit would give Globalfoundries more scale as it battles against TSMC, which is estimated to have nearly 50% of the foundry market and claims a long list of blue-chip clients.
TSMC shares slipped yesterday after Globalfoundries announced a wafer supply deal with ex-parent AMD that includes GPU and console processor manufacturing (thus far handled by TSMC). Nonetheless, Digitimes has reported TSMC's capacity is booked through the end of Q3 thanks to strong mobile/PC chip demand.

After falling 3.5% Y/Y in Q3, external disk storage system sales rose 2.4% in Q4, says IDC. The growth came even though sales of the servers that interact with these systems fell an estimated 4.4%.
Total disk storage sales, which include storage subsystems found within servers, rose 1.3% in Q4 after dropping 5.6% in Q3. IDC attributes the turnaround to ""traditional year-end budget flushes, improved economic sentiment, and a strong desire to address long-standing storage infrastructure inefficiencies.""
Market leader EMC, which posted strong Q4 numbers to go with light guidance, saw its external disk share rise 220 bps Y/Y to 32.9%, and its total disk share rise 200 bps to 25.8%. The gains largely came at the expense of restructuring IBM, whose shares respectively fell 190 bps and 200 bps to 13% and 14%.
H-P's (NYSE:HPQ) external disk share rose 30 bps to 9.6%, and its total disk share 40 bps to 16.3%.

IBM (IBM +1%) is acquiring Cloudant, provider of a distributed cloud database platform for app developers. Terms are undisclosed.
Cloudant's customer base includes Samsung, Microsoft, Adobe, and Fidelity. The company already relies on IBM-acquired SoftLayer's cloud infrastructure platform to deliver its services, which compete against Amazon Web Services' DynamoDB and solutions based on the open-source MongoDB.
All three solutions rely on NoSQL, a database architecture that differs from the age-old SQL (used by IBM's DB2, as well as ORCL's bread-and-butter database) through its support for semi-structured and unstructured data.
This feature, along with NoSQL's superior performance and scalability for certain apps, is leading the technology to be widely adopted for handling Web/cloud services and big data projects.
Separately, IBM is promising to invest $1B to bolster SoftLayer's cloud software/app platform offerings. Last month, Big Blue, increasingly looking to cloud services to halt its ongoing revenue declines, said it would invest $1.2B to build 15 new data centers for SoftLayer.

The embrace by Web/cloud giants of home-grown servers produced by Asian contract manufacturers (ODMs) continues to upend the industry. IDC thinks sales of such servers rose 45% Y/Y, and now make up 6.5% of industry revenue.

#1 H-P (HPQ), which recently reported encouraing enterprise hardware numbers, is assigned a 28.1% share (+150 bps Y/Y) by IDC. #2 IBM, whose total Q3 hardware sales fell 17% Y/Y, is given a 23.4% share (-430 bps).
Newly-private Dell had a 16.2% share (-40 bps, a reversal from recent gains), Cisco (CSCO - still seeing strong UCS server demand) a 5% share (+170 bps), and Oracle (ORCL - hurt by SPARC/UNIX server weakness) a 4.1% share (-60 bps).

The report drives home the competitive challenges faced by Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), and other firms striving to take IaaS and/or PaaS share from market leaders.
Synergy thinks the traditional Web hosting market, which Rackspace remains well-exposed to, and which has been pressured by the IaaS market's rise, only grew 3% Y/Y in Q3.
Last week, Stanley Druckenmiller cited AWS and its disruptive impact on traditional enterprise IT as a reason for shorting IBM.

547,IBM falls as Druckenmiller makes short case,"Nov. 22, 2013, 2:27 PM","

Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller has called IBM (IBM -1.5%) one of the ""more high probability shorts"" he's seen in years, and declares Amazon Web Services (AWS) is ""killing"" the IT giant.
He's also critical of Big Blue's slumping free cash flow, and its efforts to boost flagging growth via M&A.
AWS is expected to pull in less than $4B in revenue this year, but is growing at a rapid clip. In addition, analysts have argued every IT dollar eaten up by cloud services results in a greater amount of on-premise IT spend being lost.

IBM recently bought Web hosting/cloud infrastructure provider SoftLayer for a reported $2B in order to better take on Amazon, as well as rivals such as Microsoft, Google, VMware, and Rackspace.
Though off its October lows, IBM remains down 5% YTD in a year during which the Nasdaq is up over 30%. Shares were hit hard last month by a Q3 revenue miss.

548,"Nvidia launches K40 GPU, strikes partnerships with IBM and others","Nov. 18, 2013, 10:38 AM","

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has unveiled the Tesla K40,  a server/HPC GPU it claims is 40% more powerful than its predecessor  (the Tesla K20X) and the first product of its kind optimized for big  data/analytics and large-scale scientific use cases.
The K40, which competes against AMD's FirePro and Intel's Xeon Phi lines, comes with 12GB of memory and 2,880 GPU cores, as well as Nvidia's GPU Boost tech.
In tandem with the K40 launch, Nvidia has announced a partnership  with IBM to develop ""GPU-accelerated versions"" of IBM apps running on  Big Blue's high-end Power systems (they rely on IBM's Power  CPUs). Nvidia's CUDA programming model (allows apps to be optimized for Nvidia GPUs) will be leveraged, as will IBM's Rational software development tools.
IBM has been getting creative in its efforts to grow Power-related sales in the face of plunging demand for traditional UNIX Power servers. Three months ago, IBM announced it would license the Power architecture and related technologies to spur broader adoption, particularly among Web/cloud companies; Nvidia was one of the launch partners. More recently, the company opened up its Power-based Watson A.I. computing platform to 3rd-party developers.
Nvidia has also announced SGI, Cray, and other server vendors will offer the K40, and that the Tesla GPUs will work with Mellanox's (MLNX +1.9%) InfiniBand adapters (often used in HPC applications).
Nvidia's Tesla GPU sales have been growing quickly, helping offset PC and Tegra weakness. The chipmaker has also been targeting the server GPU space with its Grid GPUs (meant for cloud gaming and PC virtualization apps).

IBM, no stranger to issuing low-yield corporate debt, is offering ¬£750M worth of Dec. 2020 notes sporting an interest rate of just 2.75%.
With the company having just added $15B to its buyback program, there's a good chance some of the funds will be used to fund additional stock repurchases, which have been crucial to keeping EPS growth positive in the face of declining revenue.
IBM ended Q3 with $36.2B in debt, or $10.4B if one backs out its Global Financing division. Cash/equivalents totaled $10.2B.
Meanwhile, IBM has opened up its Watson supercomputer/artificial intelligence platform to 3rd-party developers. A developer toolkit and API is being provided, and Big Blue also plans to work with VCs to compel startups to write cloud-based apps for the platform. Retail, supply chain, and health management apps are already in the pipeline. (PR)
IBM is counting on Watson, which runs on its proprietary Power CPUs, to give a lift to a Power server business that saw a 38% Y/Y sales drop in Q3 thanks to nosediving UNIX server demand.

550,Tech giants feel impact of U.S. spying scandal,"Nov. 15, 2013, 4:41 AM","
 Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) FQ1 results earlier this week highlight how major tech firms are feeling the impact of a backlash in China to Edward Snowden's revelations about U.S. spying. ""All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,"" says Jim Lewis, a China and technology expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. Cisco has been the most explicit about attributing the Snowden effect to its falling sales in China; Beijing could be specifically targeting the company due to American hostility to telecom-equipment makers Huawei Technologies and ZTE  (OTCPK:ZTCOY) over fears that their products could be used for espionage. However, Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) experience is that the ""The Snowden effect is not real,"" adding that business in China continues to grow. Other companies to suffer in the country recently include IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the reasons cited including macro-economic factors. IBM might be somewhat inured to the NSA affair, as some of its high-end products face less competition than Cisco's offerings.  "

 Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) dispiriting Jan. quarter guidance and Oct. quarter order data has produced an AH selloff in enterprise IT and telecom equipment names, as well as a couple of the companies supplying them. NetApp's below-consensus guidance might not be helping either. 
HPQ -2.1% AH. IBM -1.1%. ALU -2%. FFIV -1.9%. CIEN -0.9%. CAVM -3%. BRCM -1.3%. Cisco's slumping FQ1 service provider (-13% Y/Y) and emerging markets (-12%) orders are bound to fuel concerns about carrier capex and macro trends. At the same time, it's worth noting Juniper and Alcatel-Lucent have been seeing better router sales to carriers (though not to Asia), and that Huawei has been doing better in emerging markets. The rest of Cisco's order data for major regions and customer groups was relatively better, but not exactly encouraging. Americas orders -2%, EMEA -4%, Asia-Pac (hurt by emerging markets weakness) -9%. Enterprise orders +2%, commercial (SMBs) +1%, public sector -1%. Switch sales (31% of revenue) rose 3% Y/Y, while routers (17% of revenue) fell 1%. Collaboration rose 1%, and service provider video fell 14% due to set-top weakness. Cisco's ASR 9000 edge router line, which EZchip (EZCH) supplies network processors for, grew 20% in FQ1 vs. 43% in FQ4. Data center (UCS servers) had another strong quarter, growing 44%, but still only accounts for 5% of revenue. Wireless (dominated by Wi-Fi gear) grew only 8% after growing 32% in FQ4 (could be a negative for ARUN and RKUS). John Chambers was asked on the CC (transcript) if the NSA spying uproar was affecting Cisco. He admitted it's a problem in China, but denied it was a major issue elsewhere.  "

IBM (IBM -0.6%) is licensing four ARM (ARMH +2.1%) Cortex CPU cores to offer to clients of its custom ASIC business, as well as ARM's Mali GPU cores. (PR)

The deal is notable both due to the size of IBM's custom ASIC ops - clients include Cisco and Juniper - and the fact the business has thus far relied on Big Blue's proprietary Power CPU cores.
The deal comes shortly after Broadcom (BRCM +0.7%), which has traditionally relied on cores from Imagination's (OTCPK:IGNMF) MIPS unit, announced it would build 64-bit network processors (NPUs) based on ARM cores using a next-gen 16nm process. Broadcom has taken out a costly ARM architectural license to build custom cores, and promises unmatched performance.
ARM-based cores have historically had a small presence in the NPU space, which has been dominated by Power, MIPS, and (largely Intel-based) x86 offerings. But the tide is turning: In addition to IBM and Broadcom, NPU vendors Cavium, Freescale, and LSI have embraced ARM.
NPUs are bound to be a lower-volume business for ARM than mobile processors. But they also carry higher ASPs, and potentially (if 64-bit cores are widely used) higher royalty rates.
IBM's chip unit, which faces tough competition from foundry rivals such as TSMC and GlobalFoundries, posted 1% Y/Y sales growth in Q3.

 IBM's Chinese sales fell 22% Y/Y in Q3 and its hardware sales within the country dove 40%, management disclosed on the CC.

A demand rebound isn't expected until after Q1 2014, as local firms wait for economic reform plans to be announced. Talking about growth market weakness in general, IBM admits only half of its challenges stem from business conditions; the rest are execution-related.

With IBM having seen six straight quarters of revenue declines, Sacconaghi wonders if Big Blue should model for 0% rev. growth going forward.

Power systems (UNIX server) sales plunged 38% Y/Y in Q3, worse than Q2's 25%. System x (x86 servers) fell 18%, storage hardware 11%. System z (mainframes) rose 6%, aided by an upgrade cycle.

575,Chanos: Analysts fooled by tech acquisitions,"Sep. 17, 2013, 1:43 PM","

A number of big cap tech companies have fooled this generation of analysts, says Jim Chanos (about minute 11 of the video), by acquiring their way into growth as organic expansion grinds to a halt. He won't name names (HPQ is already trodden ground), but Cory Johnson's mentioning of IBM and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) as fitting the bill has Chanos nodding his head, ""Acquisitions are a way of capitalizing R&D.""
""I'm very leery of tech companies that become value stocks,"" he says, partly explaining the reason for exiting another long - his stake in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? He considers it more a consumer products stock than tech stock, and believes the company is still innovating.

576,IBM promises to invest $1B in Linux,"Sep. 17, 2013, 12:24 PM","

IBM (IBM -0.4%) says it will invest $1B over the next 4-5 years in Linux and related open-source tech for use with Power server line. Among other things, the company will create Linux app development programs for Power (System p) servers, and help enable software development for its 12-core Power8 CPUs (due next year).
The announcement follows a quarter in which sales of IBM's Power servers, which use proprietary Power CPUs and tend to have higher ASPs than Big Blue's x86 servers, fell 25% Y/Y.
Plunging demand for UNIX servers had much to do with the drop; IDC estimates industry-wide UNIX server sales fell 21% Y/Y in Q2. That compares with a 5.1% drop for Windows servers, and 1.5% growth for Linux servers. The firm believes Linux now accounts for 23.2% of industry server revenue, and UNIX just 15.1%.
Enterprise Linux leader and IBM partner Red Hat (RHT -0.8%) has to be pleased with the show of support.
IBM is also promising to invest heavily in R&D for is System x x86 server unit, which saw an 11% Y/Y sales drop in Q2 (IDC thinks industry x86 sales only fell 1.3%) and was reportedly on the block earlier this year.
In addition to helping System p server sales, IBM's Linux spending could bolster its new efforts to sell its Power CPUs to 3rd-party OEMs. Many of the Internet companies targeted by the effort are big Linux fans, but they depend almost entirely on x86 servers for now.

The Indian government has signed off on the construction of two local chip manufacturing plants, but hasn't yet decided who will get to build them. A consortium featuring IBM, TowerJazz (TSEM -1%), and Indian firm Jaiprakash Associates has submitted a proposal, and so has a consortium featuring STMicroelectronics (STM +1.3%), Malaysian chipmaker Silterra, and would-be local foundry Hindustan Semiconductor.
Investments in the plants are expected to total 515.5B rupees ($8.1B). Relative to several East Asian countries, India has been a chip manufacturing laggard, but fresh government incentives and an interest in better servicing Indian electronics manufacturers and (indirectly) consumers are leading chipmakers to give the country another look.

578,"Intel roundup: Bay Trail, Chromebooks, Xeon, Apple","Sep. 12, 2013, 1:19 AM","

As expected, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has launched its 22nm Bay Trail Atom tablet CPU line at the Intel Developer Forum. Intel is promising up to a 2x CPU performance boost, and a 3x GPU performance boost over the current-gen Clover Trail, without hurting battery life.
Performance-wise, Bay Trail should be competitive with high-end ARM-based CPUs such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 and Nvidia's Tegra 4. However, some worry they'll also be competitive with Intel's more costly/higher-margin Core notebook CPUs.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has announced a slew of Chromebooks sporting Intel Haswell Core CPUs are on tap, courtesy of OEM partners such as Acer, H-P, Asus, and Toshiba. Google recently added local/offline app support to Chrome OS, a move that stands to strengthen the OS' low-end challenge to Windows.
Intel has also launched new 22nm Xeon CPUs meant for dual-CPU servers (officially given the catchy name Xeon E5 2600 v2).? Improvements over Intel's prior-gen, 32nm, Romley Xeons include support for more cores (12 vs. 8) and threads (24 vs. 16).

IBM is using Intel's latest Xeon parts in its new NeXtScale high-density server line. Like H-P with its Moonshot servers, Big Blue hopes NeXtScale will be adopted some of the Web/cloud companies increasingly opting for a do-it-yourself approach. The first NeXtScale system can pool up to 84 dual-CPU servers in a 19"" rack.
IBM is also trying to address the needs of Web/cloud companies, who generally use Intel CPUs, by licensing its Power CPU architecture.
The Xeon launch comes shortly after Intel began shipping its Avoton Atom server CPUs, which aim to head off ARM-based competition in the high-density/microserver market. Intel claims Avoton can deliver up to 6x better performance/watt than its prior-gen Centerton.

CNET observes Apple's development of a 64-bit A-series CPU (meant for iOS hardware for now) could eventually pave the way for it to use A-series parts in Macs instead of Intel CPUs. There have already been reports Apple is thinking of doing this.

579,Cisco-Whiptail deal stresses storage partnerships,"Sep. 10, 2013, 6:49 PM","

Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) $415M purchase of flash storage system vendor Whiptail marks the networking giant's official entry into the storage hardware market.
Though Cisco has become a major player in the server market through its UCS line, and has had a large presence in storage networking for some time, it has been content to leave storage sales to partners such as EMC, IBM, and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), along with server/Ethernet switch rivals such as H-P and Dell.
In a blog post explaining the deal, exec Paul Perez states Cisco concluded ""UCS needed to be best-in-class at accelerating hot data layers"" (i.e. mission-critical data), and that a flash storage offering was needed to achieve this goal.
Perez declares Whiptail to offer ""the highest scalability in performance and capacity of any scale-out flash vendor on the market today,"" (rivals such as Violin Memory might beg to differ), and imagines solutions leveraging Whiptail, UCS, and Nexus switches enabling customers to load ""vast amounts of data in seconds and minutes, not hours or days,"" among other things.
Whiptail relies on a proprietary OS built from the ground up to handle flash storage, something it argues yields superior performance.
The startup's products compete directly against systems from EMC's XtremIO unit, and indirectly against other flash-based EMC products. They also compete against IBM's Texas Memory unit and NetApp's flash offerings.
The Cisco-EMC partnership has already been pressured by the software-defined networking efforts of VMware's Nicira unit, which stand to make it easier for companies to replace Cisco gear with rival/commodity hardware (if adopted). There have been reports EMC has considered further encroaching on Cisco's turf by acquiring a networking hardware firm.

The decline is a little better than Q1's 5% drop, but still points to a bleak demand environment, as enterprise attempts to improve server efficiency (via consolidation and virtualization) and a mix shift towards cheaper, white-label servers preferred by Internet/cloud companies hurt sales. (PR)
IDC is even more pessimistic, estimating revenue fell 6.2% and units 1.2% (lower ASPs). (PR)
x86 servers (largely INTC-based) continue gaining share: Gartner thinks sales rose 2.1% Y/Y and units 4.5%. The opposite holds for Unix servers: sales -25.3% and units 27.4%. ""Other"" server sales (inc. IBM mainframes) rose 6.9%.
IBM and H-P (NYSE:HPQ), whose enterprise hardware units have fallen on hard times, remain the industry's top vendors, but continue to bleed share. IBM's share fell 160 bps Y/Y to 25.6%, and H-P's 420 bps to 25%.

DELL-OLD and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), as demonstrated by recent earnings numbers (I, II), remain share gainers. Dell +210 bps to 17.7%, Cisco +150 bps to 4.4%. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which is seeing rising (Intel-based) engineered system sales and plunging Unix/SPARC CPU server sales, is assigned a 5.8% share (-20 bps).

The Department of the Interior has awarded IBM (IBM -0.6%) a 10-year, $1B contract to provide a slew of cloud infrastructure services.
IBM's SmartCloud government and enterprise offerings are part of the package, as are SAP app hosting and cloud services tied to IBM's AIX (UNIX) OS.
The contract is IBM's biggest government cloud win to date, and comes as Big Blue continues to protest a $600M contract granted to Amazon Web Services by the CIA. IBM significantly grew its cloud infrastructure/Web hosting reach in June by acquiring private SoftLayer for a reported ~$2B.
Meanwhile, Israel's Ynet reports IBM paid $800M-$1B to acquire threat-protection software vendor Trusteer. IBM notes 7 of the top-10 U.S. banks, and 9 of the top-10 U.K. banks, use Trusteer to protect against ""financial fraud and cyber attacks.""
Like many security software upstarts, Trusteer relies on a cloud-based architecture to monitor Web activity and protect client hardware (inc. mobile devices). As Cisco's purchase of Sourcefire and FireEye's IPO filing indicate, enterprise interest in cybersecurity is picking up.

With servers running IBM's (IBM -2.2%) Power CPUs (sales -25% Y/Y in Q2) losing share to systems using Intel's (INTC -0.5%) Xeon server CPUs, IBM is forming the OpenPower Consortium, an alliance through which Big Blue will license its Power architecture and related technologies to 3rd-parties, in an effort to create a broad IT hardware ecosystem around them.
Initial partners include Nvidia (NVDA - its GPUs and CUDA computing platform will support Power), Mellanox (MLNX - InfiniBand hardware support is a good bet), Google, and Taiwanese server OEM Tyan,
Google and Tyan's support is noteworthy, given Google and many Internet peers have spurned IBM and other server giants in favor of Intel-based commodity gear made by the likes of Tyan to the specifications of Internet/cloud firms.
