 Facebook (FB +1.3%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is asserting his control over three distinct messaging services in an ambitious move to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger at a technical level, The New York Times reports. The three services would continue operating as stand-alone apps but would see a unified messaging structure underneath that would allow (for example) a Facebook user to send an encrypted message to a WhatsApp user, which could lead users to stick with texting inside Facebook properties rather than turning to Apple (AAPL +1.5%) or Google (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +0.9%). It might also promise a better chance at making money from (relatively) low-revenue WhatsApp and Instagram, perhaps via new advertising or other fee-based services. The project's in early stages and wouldn't wrap until late this year or early 2020, according to the report. The move is causing some internal turmoil; it's a reversal of Zuckerberg's earlier stance that the acquired companies' products should remain heavily separate, and amid exits from WhatsApp's and Instagram's founders, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Zuckerberg over the new integration plan on internal message boards and at a December staff meeting, the NYT says.

 Morgan Stanley?™s Katy Huberty reiterates an Overweight rating and $253 target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remaining bullish on Services and saying that the supply chain noise creates a buying opportunity. Huberty says the supplier guidance cuts reflect Apple?™s cautious holiday quarter guidance and doesn?™t impact the firm?™s Services growth forecast, which is tied to the installed base instead of new shipments. The analyst notes that unit revisions typically hit the supply chain harder than Apple due to inventory fluctuations and more bullish orders. Huberty thinks Apple reached normal run rate production earlier this year given the lack of labor and component constraints compared to previous years and that means Apple cut supply chain orders in November instead of the usual December/January.

Sources say the store logged over 2K warranty claims per week in May of that year, more than any other Apple store in the world.?               The company investigated and found the replacement surge was due to a fraud scheme where thieves bought or stole iPhones, removed valuable components, and replaced them with fakes. Thieves were returning the iPhones to Apple to receive replacements they could resell.?                  At the peak, 60% of warranty repairs in China and Hong Kong were fraudulent. Apple set aside $1.6B for warranty costs in FY13 and ended up spending $3.7B instead with much of that coming from the Chinese fraud.                   Apple tried to deal with the problem using a variety of identification tactics to no avail.

The first wave of sales for the iPhone XS and XS Max was less enthusiastic than for the iPhone 6 generation, as consumers apparently have started to back away from the iPhone XS Max for its cost and from the iPhone XS because of a lack of specification upgrades, according to the report. While some analysts are positive about the sales prospects for the iPhone XR, which will become available in late October, the report says some supply chain  sources are conservative given the iPhone XR price/performance ratio is not particularly impressive vs. high-end Android phones.

TechInsights breaks down the costs of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max with 256GB. The deep dive by TechInsights found that the iPhone XS Max contains about $443 in parts and assembly costs vs. $395.44 for the 64GB version of last year's iPhone X. ""The relatively small increase in cost despite the larger screen size was because Apple appeared to have removed some components related to its so-called 3D Touch system, which makes apps respond differently depending on how hard users press the screen,"" observes TechInsights.

 Sirius XM (SIRI -8.3%) is likely to come through successfully with its bid for Pandora Media (P +1.3%), analysts say, with few antitrust issues likely to get in the way and little likelihood of a higher bidder.

He's sticking with an Outperform rating on Pandora. (h/t Bloomberg) Evercore ISI agrees there's likely to be no meaningful antitrust issues and is ""somewhat skeptical"" of a higher bid coming in. Analyst Vijay Jayant thinks the combination will be focused on EBITDA and free cash flow more than just subscriber and revenue growth, and expects negative free cash flow at Pandora will help cut fully taxed free cash flow per share by about 7% in 2019, he says.

Expect a few more market-moving revelations as the meeting progresses. Check this page throughout the day for the latest updates.A couple of Buffett quotes early in the morning get things started in Omaha. Buffett on cryptos: ""When you buy Bitcoin, you are just hoping that the next guy will pay more; it will not produce profit itself. That is not investing, that is one kind of game."" Buffett on succession: ""We have to have the right person for Berkshire CEO. We may find it in a month or it may take six months. But it's important to have the right person."" Keeping it simple: ""Index funds are the best form of equity investing. If you consistently stick with them over decades, they will do wonders. We have not invested our cash holding in ETF because we would rather like to buy entire business.""Q&A highlights: ""The decline is faster than we thought it was going to be,"" says Charlie Munger, talking about the big drop in circulation at many of the local newspapers owned by Berkshire. Economically, it's not a huge deal for Berkshire, says Buffett, but he and Munger worry about the consequences for society.Asked why Berkshire has such a large position in American Express (NYSE:AXP), but not so much Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Buffett says the V and MC purchases were done by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and yes, he should have bought earlier and bigger.Of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) massive share buyback, Buffett says he's a big fan. Both he and Munger don't believe Apple could find suitable acquisition targets, so share repurchases are a better idea. Why never an owner of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?

Other areas to watch include services revenue and a potential record-breaking capital allocation announcement.               Revenue: Consensus expects revenue of $60.91B (Apple guided $60B to $62B), which would represent a 15% Y/Y growth, and EPS of $2.67 (was: $2.10 last year).?               Gross margins: Apple guided 38% to 38.5% and consensus sits near 38.5%.?               Check iPhones: Apple sold 77.3M iPhones last quarter, which included the holiday season, with an estimated 27M iPhone Xs. Consensus has overall iPhone unit sales of about 52M for Q2 compared to 50.8M units last year. Look at the iPhone average selling price or ASP to know how the newer iPhones performed. Last quarter, the ASP was $796 and a big drop would suggest that the high-priced X hit a sales wall.?

Seasonality: March is a seasonably slow quarter for Apple, made worse by the contraction of the global smartphone market due in part to people waiting longer to upgrade.?

 With LG Display (LPL -1.3%) struggling to produced OLED screens needed for a slew of iPhones later this year, Apple (AAPL -2.3%) may need to rely on rival Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) yet again to fill the need, The Wall Street Journal reports. Apple's worked to line up a second supplier and reduce its dependence on Samsung, but LG Display has been beset by manufacturing problems in making the screens planned for two of the three iPhone releases expected (the other model will use an LCD screen). Samsung's OLED display is one of the most expensive parts of the iPhone X, costing Apple about $97 out of $376 total cost per device, according to the report. LG is the leading maker of large OLED panels used in television sets, but hasn't yet nailed down the different technologies to make smaller smartphone panels, a source told WSJ. It's expected to supply as much as 20% of the displays for new iPhones; if it falls short, Samsung's 80% would grow.  ",,,

Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots and strokes when untreated and diagnosis is difficult as symptoms often don?™t become obvious until too late. An estimated 2.7M Americans and 34M people globally have the problem.  Researchers used an app from Cardiogram Inc. to access heart-rate sensor data in the Watch. A deep neural network analyzed the heart rate data and step-count data, which was used to determine whether a person was active (explaining a sudden heart rate spike) or at rest.  The resulting algorithm was able to tell the difference between atrial fibrillation and normal heartbeats with about 97% compared to electrocardiograms. This data came from about 50 patients with atrial fibrillation who were undergoing procedures to restore their heart rates to normal.            In a test of 1,620 people using the Watch in their everyday lives, the algorithm?™s accuracy dropped to about 72% accuracy compared to participant reports of whether or not they had atrial fibrillation.??

 ESPN (NYSE:DIS) is going to be all right, Holman Jenkins Jr. says, and never mind its recent Jemele Hill controversy or politics -- subscriber losses are bound to slow and it still has its valuable ace in the hole, live sports. With scores available on every smartphone, SportsCenter may not be as vital as it once was (and that may explain the network's current talent roster, he says), but live sports are a last bastion of ad viewing in a Netflix world. And while tech giants including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) begin throwing billions of dollars at content to build out their video, they may have a rude awakening translating their streaming-program experience into the technical challenge of serving up a live football game to 13M eager viewers, while the traditional broadcast model is optimized for it. ""The digital revolution certainly is upending the traditional 'linear' TV channels,"" Jenkins writes.

The divisions will make it easier for players to find new apps, find games, or to avoid games altogether.The descriptions for each app will look more like a blog post than a sales page. And app game developers like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) will like the fact that the App Store now allows publishers to list and promote in-app purchases straight on the app page. Players might become more willing to making those purchases if the process is easy and doesn?™t require launching the app then a search mission to find the desired purchase inside.Update: Apple is stepping up to augmented reality in a big way with the ARKit, which will bring advanced AR possibilities across iOS. ARKit supports Unreal Engine, Unity, and SceneKit and allows AR images to better integrate into the background rather than staying on top as a separate layer. The demo from Wingnut AR studios will become available as a game later this year.Update:?Apple announced two iPad Pros: the new 10.5-inch and the updated 12.9-inch device. Both have the A10X six-core CPU and 12-core GPU and both a 12MP rear-facing camera and a 7MP front-facing camera.The 10.5-inch version starts at $649, which includes 64GB of memory, while the 12.9-inch starts at $799 for 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi. Both models start shipping out next week.All iPad screens will get 50% brighter and have the ability to support HDR video. And the iPad is getting its own iOS 11 updates including the ability to use Files to browse through both the local machine and the cloud to find stored files, an expandable dock, and drag and drop features.Update: And the day caps off with the anticipated Siri speaker with the formal name of HomePod and a $349 price tag. Amazon's Echo retails for about $180 and Google Home currently on sale for $109.But Apple's marketing the HomePod more as a music speaker than a general home assistant. The specs touted include seven tweeters and Apple's A8 chip. The speaker can automatically detect the environment and adjust the sound settings accordingly. Users must plug the speaker into AC so it isn't portable.The HomePod base unit is under 7 inches tall and comes in White or Space Gray and will become available in December.Follow The Verge's live blog of the event here.

 It's Capitalist Woodstock day! Tune into the live stream on Yahoo Finance, and come back here to discuss. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger start their Q&A at around 10:30 a.m. ET. The company reported earnings last night, with Q1 operating EPS of $2,163 vs $2,274 in the same quarter a year ago. Stay tuned for updates throughout the day. Asked about whether Berkshire's structure might allow for a Wells Fargo-like sales scandal, Buffett points to a company hotline that gets 4,000 calls a year (""most of them are frivolous ... Anything that looks serious I will hear about"") and suggests that it would be hard for things to get where they were with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) without the CEO knowing, ""and the CEO has to act ... It was a huge, huge, huge error if they were getting some communications and they ignored them or sent them down.??Self-driving vehicles present a real threat to Berkshire's insurance and rail businesses, Buffett says. ""Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to the Burlington Northern,"" he says. ""And if driverless cars became pervasive, it would only be because they were safer ... and that would mean that the overall economic cost of auto-related losses had gone down, and that would drive down the premium income of Geico."" Asked about the unloading of a third of Berkshire's stake in IBM while continuing to build up in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Buffett says ?œI regard them as being quite different businesses. They are two different types of decisions and I was wrong on the first one. And we?™ll find out whether I was right or wrong on the second. I do not regard them as apples and apples. I don?™t regard them as apples and oranges."" On missed opportunities, ""we failed you"" by not figuring out Google (GOOG, GOOGL) sooner, and ""we blew Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) too,"" Charlie Munger says. ""China has a bright future"" despite growing pains, Munger says, and China's market is a lot cheaper than in the U.S. Buffett has nothing to add: Munger ""gave the headline, China's stock market will outperform the U.S.,"" and he breaks the meeting for lunch, to reconvene at 2:15 p.m. ET. Airlines?(DAL, UAL, LUV, AAL, SKYW, HA, ALK, JBLU, ALGT, JETS) are also a topic of discussion by Buffett and Munger, which isn't a shocker considering that Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) ?now has over $10B invested in the sector. Buffett: ""It's a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it's a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time ... it's fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next 5 or 10 years than at historical rates.

 AT&T's (T -3%) interest in Time Warner (TWX +7.8%) progressed quickly from ""had talks"" to ""advanced talks"" and now a deal could be set by Monday -- which Bloomberg says is due to a sped-up timetable caused by Bloomberg's initial report. That's because AT&T is said to be concerned that the publicity could allow other interested suitors like Apple (AAPL -0.4%) or Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) to jump in -- and indeed Apple is said to be monitoring the deal talks, after it made its own approach to Time Warner a few months ago, The Wall Street Journal reports. Those talks involved execs under Apple chief Tim Cook and didn't get beyond a preliminary stage. A source tells the WSJ that Google doesn't look interested in an offer for Time Warner. But the story of the deal points out just how much behind-the-scenes strategic talk is going on in the media/telecom spaces, as companies vie to be among the new leaders in an upended, converged digital media climate. Sumner Redstone was said to be considering not only the merger of CBS (CBS +2.1%) and Viacom (VIA +2.7%, VIAB +2.8%) that he's already pushing for, but also to combine that entity with Time Warner. Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA -0.5%) could join another company to get involved, the WSJ says, though that makes more sense if Time Warner's open to being parted out. Unlikely to join in this time: Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX +2.2%, FOXA +2.2%), whose own pursuit of Time Warner failed in 2014 at $85/share, and Walt Disney (DIS +1.1%).Previously: Time Warner at 15-year highs on merger talk; media companies rise (Oct. 21 2016)  ",,,

1504,"Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster on Apple's battery, AR, VR and automobile prospects","Aug. 19, 2016, 2:19 PM","
Batteries: ""We believe that in the next three years, the area where Apple can make the most impactful improvement is in battery life. While batteries aren?™t as exciting technologically as retina scanning or curved glass, we believe that functional improvements tend to drive the most consumer excitement and interest. For example, adding 3G to the iPhone 3G and the larger screen sizes for the iPhone 6 have been two of the biggest points of acceleration in the life of the phone.""Augmented reality: ""More specifically, this could include additional camera features to pull in image based information and additional sensors to enable new interactions with the real world. AR enhancements on the iPhone could also come through enhanced software. Cook also spent time on the last earnings call highlighting the company?™s work in artificial intelligence, including that much of Apple?™s AI processing happens on the device instead of in the cloud. We believe that Apple could introduce new AR features enabled by its AI software also related to processing and predicting events and locations around the user in real-time. While we don?™t expect AR- related features to drive an inflection in iPhone growth, we do see them as an important evolution in the device as we move beyond the smartphone. Long-term (beginning more meaningfully in 5-10 years), we continue to expect that some form of wearable, most likely in the form of glasses, will replace the majority of screens in our everyday lives. These wearables, and eventually contact lens or implant-based devices, will likely be the future of augmented reality hardware. We continue to expect that Apple will have a dedicated AR/MR product in the 2021-2025 timeframe.""Virtual reality: ""We continue to believe that Apple will open up the iPhone for third-party VR hardware companies to make authorized headsets by 2018; however, it?™s hard to see Apple developing a computer-powered high-end headset in the current market. Beyond the next few years, 10 years and beyond, we believe that all-in-one VR headsets will enable new experiences that replace how we use PCs and TVs today. We believe that those types of headsets could be more interested for Apple given that they are likely to be in the $500-1,500 ASP range vs smartphone-powered headsets at $100.""Automobile: ""Initial WSJ reports suggested that the car had a ?œtarget ship date??of 2019; however, more recent reports suggest the launch is more likely in 2021 or five years from now. We believe that Apple could release some of its learnings before 2021 as it continues to develop its own car. For example, autonomous driving software could come out earlier via an automotive partner or more advanced CarPlay features. In terms of the market, as we?™ve previously written, BMW might be the best comp for what Apple could do with the car in a wildly successful long-term scenario. BMW brand sold 1.9 million vehicles worldwide in 2015. At a $75k ASP, that would represent a $142.5 billion revenue opportunity. The bottom line is that the car, while it could still be scrapped, has the potential to be a true needle mover.""Munster maintains a $151 price target (current price $109.30) and Overweight rating on Apple (AAPL +0.2%).[Barron's] ",,,

 Low expectations for the next iPhone are taking some of the risk out of a pre-launch period that's tended to be bullish for Apple (AAPL -0.2%), Gene Munster says. The Piper Jaffray analyst is holding an Overweight rating and $153 price target, implying a hefty 61% upside from today's $94.81. After a spate of headlines backing off sales expectations for the next phone, Munster is noting that resale value of the last phone is in line with the comparable phone during last year's post-launch period, pointing to aftermarket stability. The stock has outperformed on the ramp into the launch, he notes. ""Looking back at the past three major number change iPhone Launches (4, 5, 6/6 Plus), shares of AAPL outperformed the S&P 500 on average by 14% with 12 weeks left until launch ...

Schiller also confirms Apple will begin showing search ads for apps within the App Store. Bloomberg reported in April Apple was mulling such a move.

The remarks come ahead of Apple's June 13-17 WWDC conference, and highlight Apple's interest in helping developers better promote and monetize their apps. A recent Localytics study found 23% of installed apps are only used once before being abandoned, and that only 38% are launched 11 or more times.

 A deal for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to invest $1B in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing (DIDI) came together with amazing speed -- a day over three weeks -- after starting with a simple Apple HQ visit to discuss the Chinese market. On April 20 in Cupertino, Didi chief Jean Liu joked with Apple CEO Tim Cook that any company named after a fruit ""could achieve something big"" and that Didi's legal name, Xiaoju Kuaizhi, means ?œlittle orange."" Apple stock had made gains earlier today but gave up some of those along with the market's afternoon snooze. It's closed up 0.2%, just barely over the 52-week low it established yesterday. In the deal, Didi will get capital to expand into new cities and draw new driver as it battles Uber (UBER), while Apple gets a closer relationship with fellow Didi backers like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, companies that could help Apple market Apple Pay and other services. The investment could pay off handsomely as well; Didi is raising a $3B round in a fast-growing market. Now read Apple: Cheapest Valuation In A Decade Â»

""The near-term weakness in the AAPL supply chain is well known at this point, but with a likely more muted [iPhone 7] cycle and content increases well understood, we would rather move to the sidelines and revisit next year,"" writes Barclays' Blayne Curtis, downgrading Cirrus Logic (CRUS -4.7%) to Equal Weight and cutting his target by $2 to $35.
Curtis: ""We still like the technology and continue to see LT opportunities, but struggle to identify further catalysts until next year when CRUS could see gains in the mid-tier (OEMs 3-10) for Android, another codec content increase and/or an in-box [smart codec] win at AAPL. We have not seen any evidence yet, but we are also worried that pressure at AAPL could filter down the supply chain, similar to post the [iPhone 5]...""
He previously asserted Cirrus will likely only ship a basic audio codec ($1 ASP) rather than a smart codec supporting noise cancellation ($2-$2.50 ASP) for the digital headset expected to accompany the iPhone 7, which is widely believed to do away with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack and have all wired headsets connect through a Lightning port. However, Curtis does think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will put another speaker in the space currently occupied by the 3.5mm jack, which would require another amplifier from Cirrus ($0.40-$0.50 ASP).
Cirrus initially sold off on last week after providing soft FQ1 guidance in its FQ4 report (released in tandem with Apple's FQ2 report), but wound up posting double-digit gains the next day. Earnings call comments about design win activity, including for digital headsets and smart codecs, may have helped.

A telecom ministry official talking with Bloomberg says the Indian government has rejected an Apple (AAPL +0.7%) request to import and sell refurbished iPhones. The country's environment ministry rejected a similar proposal in 2015.
Selling refurbished iPhones - made available to Apple through its iPhone upgrade, trade-in, and recycling programs - has been a key part of Apple's plans to grow sales in cost-sensitive India, where the company's phone share is estimated to be around 2% and cheap Android phones claim much of the smartphone market.
Bloomberg notes Apple rivals launched a public campaign against its effort to sell used iPhones, arguing ""such a move would trigger a flood of used electronics while defeating the government?™s Make-in-India program to encourage local manufacturing."" IDC believes local OEMs Micromax, Intex, and Lava are among the Indian smartphone market's top five players, along with Lenovo and market leader Samsung, which gets the majority of its Indian sales from its low-cost J-series Android phones.

""I think that is a huge over reaction look we just had actually an incredible quarter by absolute standards,"" says Tim Cook during an appearance on Jim Cramer's Mad Money. ""What we?™re seeing is that people are upgrading at a different rate a lower rate than they did last year but still higher than the year before ... the satisfaction has never been higher and the loyalty rates have never been higher."" (video)
The defense comes six days after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its FQ2 (calendar Q1) sales were down 13% Y/Y, and guided for FQ3 revenue to be down 13%-17%. It also arrives four days after Carl Icahn (once set a $240 Apple target and predicted $37.5B in FY17 sales for an Apple TV set that doesn't yet exist) disclosed he had liquidated his Apple position.
Following a Q1 in which global smartphone sales were roughly flat, Cook dismisses concerns the smartphone market is saturated. ""Penetration today is in the 40s a long way to go. Emerging markets like India LTE penetration is zero we?™ve got great innovation in the pipeline new iPhones that will incent you and other people that have iPhones today to upgrade...""
He insists recent Chinese sales pressures won't last. ""[T]he iPhone upgrade rate affects all countries including China. The great thing is, the [Android] switcher rate in China is huge. 40% up over the first half of last year, the first half of this year ... Economy, clearly not as strong as it was a year ago. Softening. Currency weakening ... five years ago, there were about 50 million people in the Chinese middle class. Five years from now that number?™s going to be almost 500 million ... I could not be more optimistic about China.""
Cook on India: ""India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022. India today has about 50% of their population at 25 years of age or younger ... And this year, the first year, LTE begins to roll out ... the carriers don?™t sell phones in India. So there?™s a lot of work to do. But last quarter we grew 56% in India on iPhone units.""
On the Apple Watch: ""[I]f you look at iPod, iPod wasn?™t viewed as a success [when it first launched], but today it?™s viewed as an overnight success ... I think that in a few years we will look back and people will say, ?œHow could I have ever thought about not wearing this watch???Because it?™s doing so much for you. And then it will all of a sudden be an overnight success.""

As usual, no specific Watch sales figure is given. Watch sales are expected to be very seasonal, with ~40% coming in calendar Q4. IDC estimates Watch shipments totaled 11.6M in 2015.

Startup Light?™s L16 camera is the first salvo in the company's attempt to upend a digital SLR market dominated by Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Nikon (OTCPK:NINOY). The L16 contains 16 different sets of lenses and sensors - five shoot at 35mm, and the other 11 at 75-150mm - in a form factor resembling that of point-and-shoot cameras. Up to ten of the lenses/sensors simultaneously fire when a picture is taken.
As a result, only zoom and shutter speed are determined at the time of shooting. Unlike with conventional cameras, qualities such as focus and depth-of-field can be adjusted afterwards thanks to the L16?™s use of computational imaging. Meanwhile, having up to ten lenses/sensors fire at once allows the L16 to create images as large as 52MP, and helps a lot with low-light photography.
At $1,699, the L16 isn?™t cheap. And even if one was willing to spend that much to buy one, pre-orders have sold out. However, Light insists the L16 is simply a proof-of-concept, and that its long-term goal is give consumers cameras that can deliver both professional-quality photos and smartphone-like simplicity. Light could have a tough time winning over professional photographers who depend on DSLRs and their professional-grade lenses. However, the company insists enthusiast consumer photographers are a larger opportunity.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to provide similar functionality on a much smaller scale with the iPhone 7. The next-gen iPhone is rumored to sport a dual-lens camera that leverages technology developed by computational imaging startup LinX (acquired in 2015).

The Information reports two Apple (AAPL -0.6%) engineering teams working on creating new cloud infrastructure meant to improve the reliability of iCloud and other services are ?œin open conflict.??An engineering manager (Steve D?™Aurora) has resigned, and more departures are expected.
The turf war reportedly stems from Apple?™s 2015 decision to extend the reach of the cloud platform that powers Siri to other services, such as iCloud, iMessage, and iTunes. That led the Siri team (features ~200 employees) to battle with an engineering team (features 1,000+ employees) responsible for many of those cloud offerings. ?œPhilosophical differences??have emerged for many technical issues.
The report follows ones in March stating Apple has launched an effort (codenamed Project McQueen) to create a cloud infrastructure that would lower the company?™s reliance on third-party clouds, and that Apple - already a user of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure - has begun using the Google Cloud Platform to help power iCloud.
Analyst Ben Thompson recently argued Apple?™s ?œfunctional organization??structure, in which leaders are given responsibilities tied to areas of expertise (design, operations, software, etc.) rather than products (iPhone, iPad, etc.), has hurt the quality of Apple?™s services, even as it creates great integrated user experiences in other realms.

 There's some buzz out of Germany that Apple (AAPL -0.7%)?has a secret R&D lab up and running with 20 employees working on an electric vehicle project. The original report in German is from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, while Mashable has a mashup of the latest Apple Car development. The publication deduces that Apple is considering German manufacturing and will partner with supplier Magna International (MGA +0.8%).
Germany isn't completely foreign territory for Apple as it dabbles with EV car possibilities. Last year, CEO Tim Cook met with BMW (BAMXY) execs and toured an i3 manufacturing site in Leipzig. Earlier today, Electrek reported that former Tesla (TSLA -4.3%)?VP of vehicle engineering Chris Porritt moved to Apple to work on the company's EV project. The publication speculates that Porritt could be a candidate to head Project Titan which has been operating in a leadership void since Steve Zadesky stepped down.

Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) ultra-thin 12"" retina MacBooks (launched a year ago) have been updated to include 1.1-1.3GHz. dual-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M CPUs based on the chip giant's Skylake architecture, which was released last summer/fall. The original MacBooks used CPUs based on Intel's prior-gen Broadwell architecture. The Skylake chips come with an integrated GPU (the Intel HD 515) said to deliver up to 25% better graphics performance.
Apple has also provided faster PCIe flash storage for its retina MacBooks, and promises an additional hour of battery life. A rose gold option has been added to go with existing gold, silver, and space grey options. The notebooks still sport an all-metal enclosure and Force Touch trackpad, and continues relying on a single USB Type-C port for power and data.
A base model (1.1GHz. Core M3 CPU with Turbo Boost speeds of up to 2.2GHz. and 256GB of storage) still goes for $1,299, and a more powerful model (1.2GHz Core M5 CPU with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz., 512GB of storage) for $1,599. A Core M7 CPU is available via configure-to-order options.
With a weak PC market weighing, Apple's Mac revenue fell 3% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $6.7B, with units dropping 4% to 5.3M. ASP rose to $1,270 from the prior quarter's $1,205.

Update: Apple has also quietly made a small-but-notable update to the $999 base model for the 13"" MacBook Air: It now comes with 8GB of RAM instead of 4GB.

1603,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"Apr. 15, 2016, 12:47 AM","


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

In my lab stress test, which cycles through websites with uniform screen brightness, the SE lasted 10 hours?”more than two hours longer than both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s, and nearly three hours longer than the Galaxy S7.""
With the SE's body similar to that of the 5S, and its internals having much in common with the 6S/6S+, the rest of Fowler's review doesn't contain many surprises. A Geekbench test found the SE (powered by an A9 CPU) delivers ~70% better performance than the (A7-powered) 5S. Its 12MP rear camera ""performs admirably in most settings,"" though Samsung's Galaxy S7 is said to provide better low-light shots. And one-handed use is naturally easier than it is with the SE's larger siblings.
In other Apple news, the company has announced it's working with musician Will.i.am on an original TV series about the app economy. Details are scant about the show's financing and storylines, or about how much the iOS App Store will be promoted.

Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been telling companies Apple Pay will be available later this year on sites accessed via the Safari browser on iPhones/iPads containing a TouchID fingerprint sensor. It adds Apple has considered making the service available on sites accessed via Macs, but it isn't clear if the company will do so.
Apple Pay already supports payments carried out via mobile apps, to go with its well-known support for NFC-based in-store payments. An announcement regarding mobile site support could occur during the annual WWDC conference (typically occurs in June).
Online payments leader PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is down 1.2% after hours to $40.03. PayPal handled $20B worth of mobile transactions last year (+45% Y/Y and 25% of total volume), and has seen its One Touch mobile payment solution (allows users to pay without re-entering their login or billing/payment info) adopted by over half of the top 500 online retailers.
As Re/code notes, PayPal's Braintree unit provides back-end payment processing for some in-app Apple Pay purchases. But PayPal profits more if purchases are made via PayPal accounts. Aside from the size of its iOS base, favorable demographics make Apple a mobile payments threat: iOS users tend to be wealthier on average than Android users in a given market, and more likely to make purchases with their devices.

Tech news site Ars Technica reports Apple (AAPL +1.1%) is in ""advanced talks"" to buy U.K.-based Imagination Technologies (OTCPK:IGNMF), whose PowerVR GPU cores are used within Apple's A-series processors. Imagination is up 19.6% in London; its market cap stands at $869M.
Acquiring Imagination would further add to Apple's chip R&D efforts. Right now, those efforts include designing the A-series chips and the custom ARM CPU cores that go into them, the M9 motion co-processor, and fingerprint sensor and LCD timing controller ICs.
Apple already owns an 8.4% stake in Imagination, and has often trumpeted the graphics capabilities of its hardware - yesterday, the company declared the A9X processor going into the iPad Pro has more GPU power than an Xbox 360. Apple could presumably buy Imagination with offshore cash.
An Apple/Imagination deal could spell an opportunity for ARM (ARMH -0.3%), whose Mali GPU cores compete with Imagination's PowerVR line, to take share at non-Apple Imagination customers such as Samsung. iPhone/iPad audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) is down slightly - Imagination's product line includes voice pre-processing IP, but GPU cores drive the lion's share of the company's business.

Before the S.C., Samsung is challenging the $399M awarded to Apple for infringement of the company's design IP (e.g. rounded-corner front faces, bezels, icon grids), arguing they contributed only marginally to its hardware.
A reminder: The disputed funds equal less than 0.1% of Apple's market cap and less than 0.3% of Samsung's, and the fervor of the mobile patent wars has cooled considerably since 2012. In 2014, Apple and Samsung agreed to end their non-U.S. patent battles.

Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. ""It?™s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud.""

Stifel's Patrick Newton, hiking his Coherent (COHR +3.2%) target by $18 to $100: ""Our research indicates the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain is ramping for OLED production across its portfolio, likely in the 2018 timeframe, requiring a significant investment in OLED hardware, including Coherent?™s Excimer Laser Assembly (ELA) Linebeam products."" His FY16 (ends Sep. '16) and FY17 EPS estimates have been respectively hiked by $0.15 and $0.20 to $4.40 and $5.25; consensus is at $4.44 and $5.07.
Newton: ""We note technologies that use Coherent?™s solution, specifically low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), has significantly higher share in OLED production relative to LCD. Our research indicates benefits from the OLED shift extend beyond hardware with the higher utilization of laser discharge units (LDUs) increasing the company?™s service revenue relative to LCD, all else equal."" He also observes Coherent's OLED-related laser sales carry higher margins than its LCD-related sales.
The note comes five weeks after Coherent reported (along with FQ1 results) strong OLED-related orders for its Linebeam laser systems, and forecast the orders would continue through 2017. It also follows multiple reports indicating Apple plans to use OLEDs in future iPhones - the Nikkei reported of a 2018 ETA.

CLSA's Sriji Pajjuri reports supply chain checks indicate Intel (INTC +0.6%) has landed a portion of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 baseband modem orders. He estimates the company could supply 30%-40% of the modems going into the device. Pajjuri thinks such a win would boost Intel's revenue and earnings by 1.5%-2%, and respectively hurt current iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm's (QCOM -1.2%) revenue and earnings by 4% and 2%.

VentureBeat reported back in March 2015 Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem (450Mbps peak download speeds) would go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. The site followed up in October by stating Intel ""now has a thousand people or more"" working to get the XMM 7360 designed into an iPhone, and that Apple is interested in eventually developing an SoC pairing a 4G modem with an A-series app processor, with Intel manufacturing the SoC and providing modem IP.
Qualcomm is still viewed as having a modem performance lead on the high-end. The company recently unveiled a modem (the Snapdragon X16) supporting 1Gbps peak download speeds, while adding the chip is expected to go into commercial products in 2H16.
Separately, Baird's Tristan Gerra has upgraded Intel to Outperform, and hiked his target by $5 to $38. He cites healthy DCG (server CPU division) growth and (without naming Apple) the potential for a major ""tier-1 smartphone ramp"" in 2H16.
Gerra: ""After being on the sidelines for a few years on Intel, we think data center has reached sufficient critical mass within Intel's mix to drive a resumption in EPS growth starting in 2017 ... Assuming a low single-digit decline in annual PC revenue and a high single-digit growth rate in data center (below Intel's 15% growth target), DCG mix becomes large enough to drive EPS growth starting in 2017 and in years forward ... We believe Intel's LTE technology has matured, improving Intel's positioning for a potential tier-one smartphone ramp this second half.""

Apple (AAPL +0.2%) is committed to raising its quarterly dividend annually, Tim Cook stated at his company's annual meeting. As it is, Apple has been announcing dividend hikes in recent years in tandem with its FQ2 (calendar Q1) report, and CFO Luca Maestri has promised an update to Apple's capital return in tandem with this year's FQ2 report. The quarterly dividend is currently at $0.52/share (2.2% annual yield).

Cook also suggested Apple sees the current environment as a buyer's market for acquiring tech companies. ""In times when equity values are falling there's great opportunity to [buy companies]."" He added Apple has bought 19 companies in the list 15 months (some purchases are known, some aren't).
Not surprisingly, Cook defended Apple's stance in its battle with the FBI in the San Bernardino case. ""We are staunch advocates about our customers??privacy and personal safety ... We do these things because they are the right thing to do.""
When asked about Apple's widely-rumored car efforts, Cook hinted an Apple car could take a while.

 With Viacom (VIA +1%, VIAB +0.3%) looking to sell a strategic stake in Paramount Pictures, who could be interested in buying? Foreign investors are likely, amid a wave of investment in Hollywood from overseas. China's Perfect World is putting $250M into a development slate at Universal, while in-country counterpart Bona Film Group said in November it was putting $235M into a slate at Fox. Analysts suggest the studio is worth about $5.5B today, notes The Hollywood Reporter, so a minority stake could still come to $2B. Viacom paid $9.8B for the studio a dozen years back. Major conglomerates like Alibaba (BABA +0.6%), Dalian Wanda and Fosun (OTCPK:FOSUF) have an appetite for Hollywood deals -- and Wanda already owns cinema chain AMC and producer Legendary Entertainment, while exploring a stake in Lions Gate. A key interest with those firms is ability to get Paramount products into China, where Transformers is a major phenomenon. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY +0.2%) has similar international media appetites. Fosun is trying to buy Bona and take it private, which would give it Bona's entry into Fox's slate. Back home, Lions Gate (LGF +8.8%) is now a frequent source of tie-up rumors -- and is on the move today amid Amazon.com (AMZN +0.1%) content-deal chatter. Both Lions Gate and Amazon could use a piece of Paramount for different reasons. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL +1.5%) has been floated as a possible bidder for Time Warner, as it may be shopping for content to feed TV dreams -- but a stake in Paramount would come far cheaper than trying to swallow Time Warner whole for $50B-$80B.

Digitmes reports Asian camera lens makers 'have sent dual-lens camera samples to Apple (AAPL -1.2%) for testing,"" and that Apple is reportedly planning to include a dual-lens camera within a next-gen iPhone.
Dual lenses can allow users to zoom in without diminishing imaging quality - one lens can be wide-angle, and the other a zoom lens - and also improve low-light performance. Most interestingly, they can also enable depth analysis, which in turn enables features such as 3D image capture, background removal, and automatic blurring.
The report follows Apple's purchase (reported last April) of LinX Computational Imaging, a startup that was working on multi-sensor camera modules promised to deliver SLR-like image quality, superior low-light shots, and the ability to simultaneously take multiple shots at different apertures.
Separately, 9to5 Mac reports Apple plans to hold its expected March event on the 15th (a Tuesday). In-line with past reports, 9to5 states Apple plans to reveal a new 4"" iPhone (believed to be called the 5se and feature improved internals), an iPad Air 3, and an Apple Watch software/band update.
The Air 3 is expected to include (per 9to5) an improved camera and speakers, and a smart connector for attaching peripherals. Other reports have indicated the tablet will sport a 4K display and improved battery life.

The FT reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""has assembled a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets that could one day rival Facebook's Oculus Rift or Microsoft's HoloLens.""
The team is said to include ""hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies."" The FT also notes Apple has bought Flyby Media, a developer of software that lets mobile devices ""scan"" real-world objects and add them to a virtual collection.
The report shortly follows positive earnings call remarks by Tim Cook regarding VR's potential, and the hiring of VR expert Doug Bowman. Motion sensor technology provider PrimeSense was acquired in 2013.
For now, hardware costs and processing demands remain challenges for the budding VR/AR headset market. Facebook has priced its first consumer Oculus Rift model (it's due to ship in March) at $599, and requires the device to be paired with a PC containing a high-end GPU. The much less powerful Gear VR, which uses Samsung phones to power and provide a display for an Oculus VR platform, goes for only $100.

1659,"Apple falls towards $95 post-earnings; Street worried about China, talks up services","Jan. 27, 2016, 12:40 PM","

Down just moderately after hours in the wake of its mixed FQ1 results and soft FQ2 guidance - some bad news was priced in following chip supplier warnings and iPhone order cut reports - Apple (AAPL -4.5%) is seeing steeper losses today. Several chip suppliers are also off.
Not surprisingly, many on the Street are nervous about earnings call remarks regarding macro pressures in general, and Chinese pressures in particular. However, bulls are also taking heart in Apple's efforts to highlight services growth - reported FQ1 services revenue rose 26% Y/Y to $6.1B, and Apple asserts its installed base drove nearly $9B in related purchases (+24% Y/Y). With revenue guided to drop 9%-14% Y/Y in FQ2, future iPhone growth is also the subject of much debate.
Macquarie's Ben Schachter (Outperform, $117 target): ""The company rang the alarm bells loud and clear on macro weakness ... Cook put something of a line in the sand in implying that the March qtr would be the trough for iPhone unit growth ... the new disclosures confirm our thesis that the % of profit contribution from Services is almost 2x its % of revs, i.e., Services should contribute almost 20% of profits in FY??6 despite representing only about 10% of revs.""
Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold, $105 target): ""We remain concerned about the lack of growth in iPhone units this year, the slowdown in China sales, and gross margin pressure from FX as we move through the year ... With AAPL becoming a recurring revenue story, we expect the valuation to rerate in line with other mature, services-type companies.""
Susquehanna's Chris Caso (Positive, $140 target): ""We think the question about whether iPhone can grow was, however, a more relevant argument when the stock was higher. With the stock at its current level (AAPL?™s free cash flow yield is now in excess of 10%), we think the more relevant question now is whether iPhone can continue to generate cash at similar levels over a reasonable investment horizon ... Nonetheless, what?™s ultimately needed for AAPL to be viewed as a growth stock once again is for them to once again simply invent something new that will have the impact of the iPod, iPhone or iPad."" (ed: could an electric car do the job?)
Other opinions: 1) Jan Dawson still sees plenty of room to cross-sell new products/services to a base of 1B+ active users. 2) VentureBeat's Chris O'Brien thinks more transparency is needed on Apple Watch/Apple TV sales and services revenue (among other things). 3) 9to5 Mac's Ben Lovejoy argues it's time for Apple might need to rethink iPhone pricing in light of macro/forex pressures and competition.
On SA, Bill Maurer notes Apple disclosed 60% of iPhone owners haven't upgraded to an iPhone 6/6+ or 6S/6S+, and that a rumored new 4"" iPhone could appeal to some of them. Paulo Santos, on the other hand, is skeptical a new 4"" iPhone will provide a big lift, and considers FQ1's 25% Y/Y iPad unit drop ""more serious than it looks.""

FQ1 iPhone sales of 74.8M were close to Street expectations, but iPad and Mac shipments (16.1M and 5.3M, respectively) were below. On its earnings call, Apple mentioned forex swings and Chinese macro pressures are weighing on sales.

On the earnings call, Tim Cook noted Apple has seen economic turbulence in China/Hong Kong - Intel has also reported seeing Chinese macro pressures. Cook insists Apple remains bullish on China, and predicts rising 4G penetration will continue lifting iPhone sales. 50% of Chinese iPhone sales are said to be to first-time buyers. (live blogs: WSJ, Business Insider)
Notably, when asked about virtual realty, Cook suggested he's positive on the technology. ""I don?™t think it?™s a niche. I think it can be ??it?™s really cool and has some interesting applications."" Apple recently hired VR expert Doug Bowman; Facebook is getting set to ship its first consumer Oculus Rift model, and Google/Alphabet has created a dedicated VR unit.
When asked about iPhone ASP, CFO Luca Maestri suggested a favorable mix gave a lift - demand for 5.5"" iPhones and higher storage tiers could be helping. Regarding forex, Maestri said Apple expects a 4% FQ2 revenue hit, and sees sales dropping 5%-10% Y/Y in constant currency (implies a 9%-14% drop in dollars). Forex had a $49 impact on FQ1 iPhone ASP ($691 vs. $740).
Also mentioned: 1) iPhone channel inventory was at the low end of Apple's target range at the end of FQ1, and iPad channel inventory within its target range. 2) App Store revenue rose 27% Y/Y, and App Store customers 18%. 3) Apple plans to update its capital return plan next quarter, and to be active in debt markets.

Greenfield, bearish for a long time, is still fairly pessimistic: ""Our core thesis has not changed. We simply do not believe Pandora can ever generate meaningful earnings to justify its valuation. There are no barriers to entry in online music with competition continuing to build ... Pandora [also] faces an increasing wave of competition for mobile advertising dollars from a wide array of companies with far superior data/analytics (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, etc.).""

""The iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June 30, 2016,"" Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) states on its developer site. ""Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network, advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June 30."" The App Network, one part of the iAd platform, allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAd's publisher network
The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue. BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI) and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys.
iAd, launched in 2010, has served ads on iOS devices, Macs, and PCs.

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: ""The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015.""
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. ""Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues."" Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

9to5 Mac, which has been fairly reliable with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product scoops, reports Apple plans to launch a pair of fully wireless Bluetooth Beats headphones (no cable connecting the right and left earbuds), potentially at the same time the iPhone 7 launches. The product stands to be the first major new headphone launch from Beats since Apple bought the company in 2014.
9to5 adds the headphones are expected to come with a portable charging case, and feature a noise-cancelling microphone system that enables calls and Siri commands without an in-line mic or remote. It also joins other sites in reporting the iPhone 7 won't feature a standard 3.5mm headphone jack - headphone users will have to rely either on Bluetooth or a Lightning connector, perhaps with a 3.5mm adapter attached. A petition asking Apple to keep the 3.5mm jack has amassed over 200K signatures.
Regarding the iPhone 7, sources tell 9to5 Apple is still testing three different designs, including ""a completely new, thinner look as well as a backup design that looks substantially like the iPhone 6S.""
iPhone/iPad audio codec chip supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) might also be a supplier for the wireless headphones. Earlier today, Pac Crest (upgraded Cirrus) reported hearing from headphone makers the use of a digital connector such as Lightning both improves sound quality and allows them to embed a smart codec chip within their headphones.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought Emotient, a startup that relies on a form of A.I. known as deep learning to decipher human emotions via facial expressions. Emotient has mostly worked with advertisers to help them gauge consumer reactions to their ads, but many other use cases for its technology are also possible,
This is the third A.I.-related Apple acquisition to be reported in the last three months. The company has also bought Perceptio, a company working on A.I.-based image-recognition systems for smartphones that don't need to heavily access cloud data, and VocalIQ, creator of an A.I.-based platform for creating personal assistants that can understand natural-language queries and commands.
Google and Facebook have been making big A.I. investments themselves, aiming to use the technology for everything from detecting faces to tagging photos to analyzing websites and apps to make content recommendations. Like Google Now, Siri and Apple's Proactive assistant leverage A.I.

Nearly $40B had been paid out to developers over the App Store's lifetime, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) discloses in this year's holiday season App Store PR. With Apple getting a 30% cut on App Store transactions, $40B in payouts would equal $57.1B in gross revenue and $17.1B in net revenue.
Over $20B was spent through the App Store in 2015 ($6B+ cut for Apple), up from ~$15B in 2014. Over $1.1B was spent on apps and in-app purchases during the two weeks ending Jan. 3 (a busy period due to Christmas gift unwrapping).
Though Google Play's download rates have long surpassed the App Store's, favorable demographics and Apple's requirement that a credit card # be supplied to set up an iTunes account have led the App Store to maintain a healthy monetization edge, which in turn leads many developers to still write for iOS first and Android second.

When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines 18 months ago regarding the radiation risk from cellphones, it used unusually bold language: ""We recommend caution in cellphone use.""
Within weeks, though, the CDC reversed course. It no longer recommended caution, and deleted a passage specifically addressing potential risks for children.
Mainstream scientific consensus currently holds that there is little to no evidence that cellphone signals raise the risk of brain cancer or other health problems. Nevertheless, more than 500 pages of internal records obtained by NYT, along with interviews with former agency officials, reveal a debate and some disagreement among scientists and health agencies about what guidance to give as the use of mobile devices skyrockets.

Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has suspended plans to offer an online TV service, and will focus for now on helping media companies directly sell content via the App Store.

Media execs have said they expect Apple and other new entrants pay more per channel than pay-TV incumbents.
The report comes shortly after CBS CEO Les Moonves stated Apple had put its online TV service plans ""on hold."" Moonves still expects Apple to eventually offer such a service. ""It has four major networks and 10 cable networks, let?™s say, and the price point will be in the $30s, $30 to $35, $40 maybe.

1700,Apple reportedly plans March Apple Watch event; iPhone battery case launched,"Dec. 8, 2015, 12:38 PM","


9to5 Mac (pretty accurate historically in reporting about Apple events) reports Apple (AAPL -0.6%)  plans to hold a March event to reveal a next-gen Apple Watch. It adds a? 4"" iPhone 6C (the subject of many recent rumors) could also debut.

In June, 9to5 reported an Apple Watch 2 is expected to have a FaceTime video camera, and will be able to receive data solely through its Wi-Fi radio (eliminating the need for iPhone pairing).? IDC recently estimated Apple shipped 3.9M Watches in Q3, up from 3.6M in Q2.
Separately Apple has launched a $99 Smart Battery Case, the first iPhone battery case to be created by Apple itself. The silicone case, which competes with offerings from Anker, Mophie, and other 3rd-party suppliers, works with the iPhone 6 and 6S (but not the 6+ and 6S+), and promises to boost talk to up to 25 hours and 4G Internet use to up to 18 hours. It's slimmer than many rival products, but has a protruding battery on the back.
The case is differentiated in part via hardware integration: Users can find out how much battery life remains for both the case and their iPhone's battery through the lock screen (thus removing the need for LED indicator case lights), the case charges and passes through data via standard Lightning cables, and antennas have been integrated to prevent the case from degrading cellular performance.
Reviews are mixed: The WSJ's Joanna Stern likes the iPhone integration and form factor, but observes many rival cases provide more juice for less cost. A $40 Anker case boosts battery life by 124%, more than the Smart Battery Case's 80%.
Engadget's Chris Velazco: ""Apple's first battery case works, and it works well. Here's the rub, though: There are plenty of cheaper, more capacious options, and some of those are prettier too. What the Smart Battery Case offers over its rivals is a sense of cohesiveness that stems from Apple controlling both the hardware and software experience.""

Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will make a $548M payment to Apple by Dec. 14 related to Apple's (AAPL +3.1%) much-publicized 2012 legal win in a California federal court. Apple had previously been awarded $930M, but an appeals court removed $382M in trade dress dilution damages in May.
Nonetheless, in a joint case statement, Samsung says it ""reserves all rights to reclaim or obtain reimbursement"" for its payout should the judgment against it be ""reversed, modified, vacated or set aside on appeal or otherwise, including as a result of any proceedings before the USPTO addressing the patents at issue.""
Naturally, Apple ""disputes Samsung's asserted rights to reimbursement."" Samsung has successfully challenged the validity of an Apple pinch-to-zoom patent (the '915 patent) asserted in the case at the USPTO - Apple has appealed the USPTO's decision to a federal circuit court - and has hinted it could appeal the Apple case to the Supreme Court. However, the S.C. only hears a small portion of appealed cases.
Apple and Samsung have already agreed to drop their non-U.S. legal disputes. Meanwhile, Apple's May 2014 settlement with Motorola Mobility sparked hopes of a deal with Samsung.
Samsung's payment is equal to less than 0.1% of Apple's current market cap of $662B. Apple is rallying on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.9%.

 KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record when it comes to sharing specs for future Apple (AAPL -0.6%) products (and a mixed track record regarding launch dates/pricing), reports a new 4"" iPhone (expected to be called the 6C) will launch next year. The phone, which could replace the 5S as Apple's entry-level model and appeal to those who prefer the smaller form factors of older iPhones, is said to feature an A9 CPU (like the 6S/6S+), a metal case (unlike the plastic 5C), an NFC radio/Apple Pay support, and a camera similar to the iPhone 5S'. 3D Touch support isn't expected. Kuo thinks shipments will start in early 2016, potentially ahead of a March/April launch. He estimates the device will sell for $400-$500 - the 6S and 6S+ respectively start at $649 and $749 unsubsidized. Cowen reported a year ago Apple is working on a new 4"" iPhone. More recently, a Chinese site reported a metal 4"" iPhone would arrive in early 2016. In other news, IDC estimates Apple Watch shipments totaled 3.9M in Q3, up 300K Q/Q and good for an 18.6% wearable unit share (revenue share is likely higher). Market leader Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) had an estimated 22.2% share via 4.7M shipments, and #3 Xiaomi a 17.4% share via 3.7M shipments. Apple has grouped Watch sales into its ""Other Products"" reporting category.  ",,,

As for holiday promotions, Apple has none in its own stores (other than price-matching), but allows other retailers to offer deals.
Getting down to specific products, the iPhone and Apple Watch were the most popular ones, with the Watch likely the number seller online. IPads are emerging as the first computing device for kids, with the iPad Air 2 the hottest gift item for kids eight and older, the Mini for those younger.

1707,Report: Apple to begin using OLED iPhone displays in 2018,"Nov. 25, 2015, 3:09 PM","

Japan's Nikkei reports Apple (AAPL -0.5%) will launch iPhones sporting OLED displays starting in 2018. To date, the company has exclusively used LCDs for its retina displays.
The paper adds securing enough OLEDs to meet Apple's needs (the company sells over 200M iPhones/year) could be difficult, and that Apple will ""work over the next year or so"" with suppliers to see if it can obtain enough displays and eliminate technical drawbacks such as performance degradation.
iPhone LCD supplier LG Display (LPL +6.9%), which has already unveiled plans to invest ~$8.5B in OLED manufacturing through 2018, is said to be ""planning capacity upgrades."" OLED materials/IP provider Universal Display (OLED +5.2%) have caught a bid on the Nikkei's report; LPL was already higher on the day.
OLEDs have long been a staple on Samsung's Galaxy S and Note lines. Supporters of the technology praise its high contrast/deep blacks and potential thickness and power consumption advantages. Apple, however, has argued its LCDs provide superior color accuracy.
There have long been rumors Apple is thinking of adopting OLEDs. The company recently filed a patent application for an integrated OLED display and touch panel, with a fingerprint reader located underneath.

It has also been applied towards gaming, where avatars can be altered based on a gamer's real-life expressions. (promo video)
The acquisition follows Apple's 2013 purchase of former Kinect motion sensor tech provider PrimeSense, and its 2015 purchase of multi-sensor camera module developer LinX, whose modules enable (among other things) depth sensing and 3D image capture.

In the application, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) states integrating an OLED stack and touch sensors on a silicon substrate ""can allow for an extremely high number of pixels per inch,"" and that arranging OLED sub-pixels side-by-side with touch sensors ""can also lead to a wider viewing angle display with a higher contrast ratio, higher brightness, and more vibrant colors without compromising touch sensitivity.""

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.4%) is talking with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and other banks about launching a P2P mobile payments service that would be linked with Apple Pay, and compete with PayPal's (PYPL -1.4%) Venmo service. Users would be able to ""zap payments from their checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices."" A 2016 launch is reportedly possible.
Any revenue collected by Apple from the service would likely be tiny for a company of its size - Apple reportedly gets $0.15 for every $100 of credit transactions done via Apple Pay, and half a cent on Apple Pay debit transactions. The primary goal, rather, would be to provide another service that helps keep users loyal to Apple's ecosystem.
PayPal has fallen moderately in response. The lion's share of the company's transaction volume comes from merchant payments (where Apple, Amazon, and others already compete) rather than P2P. Facebook and Google have dabbled in P2P payments via services attached to Messenger and Gmail/Google Wallet.

FQ4 iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales rose 120% Y/Y in mainland China (driving 99% total Greater China revenue growth), CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call. Meanwhile, Tim Cook insisted Chinese macro conditions remain good, and talked up the potential for middle class growth and rising 4G penetration to boost iPhone sales in China and other Asian markets. Over 50% of Chinese iPhone buyers were first-time buyers.
Also mentioned by Cook: A strong dollar is expected to have a 700 bps impact on FQ1 revenue growth, after having an 800 bps impact in FQ4. With last year's iPhone 6 launch yielding tougher comps, FQ1 guidance implies 1%-4% Y/Y revenue growth (8%-11% exc. forex), down from FQ4's 22%. Cook expresses confidence iPhone sales will rise Y/Y, and sees smartphone upgrade programs (both Apple's and carriers') shortening upgrade cycles.
Maestri defends the iPad (revenue -20% Y/Y in FQ4), stating sell-through was 10.3M units (above sell-in of 9.9M, but still down from year-ago sell-in of 12.3M) as channel inventories fell, and that Apple has 73% of the $200+ segment of the U.S. tablet market.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) have been ordered to pay tens of millions of euros in tax repayments, under a new ruling that may spell big trouble for other corporations.
""All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager declared at a news conference today, stating the two companies' European tax deals were illegal.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ""now has a thousand people or more working to outfit a 2016 iPhone"" with its XMM 7360 2G/3G/4G modem, sources tell VentureBeat. It adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may dual-source its 2016 iPhone modems via Intel and current supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
That meshes with a March VentureBeat report stating the XMM 7360 will go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Though an August Northland Securities report forecast Intel will supply modems for some iPhone 6S/6S+ units, teardowns indicate Apple is solely relying on Qualcomm's MDM9635M modem.
The MDM9635M supports 300Mbps peak download speeds, and the XMM 7360 450Mbps peak speeds. Qualcomm, whose high-end modems are generally considered to have a performance/power consumption edge, recently unveiled the X12, which supports 600Mbps peak speeds and will be integrated with its Snapdragon 820 processor.
Also: VentureBeat reports Apple would like to eventually develop an SoC that features both an A-series app processor and a 4G modem, and which would be manufactured using Intel's 14nm process. The site also suggests Apple is interested in Intel's 10nm process (due in 2017).
Intel would provide modem IP for the SoC in addition to manufacturing the chip. To date, Intel has paired discrete A-series processors manufactured by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) with 3rd-party modems (in recent years, Qualcomm's). Intel recently bought 3G CDMA modem assets (needed to service Verizon, Sprint, China Telecom, and certain other carriers) from Taiwan's VIA Telecom.

On Apple hiring Tesla's ""most important engineers"": ""Important engineers? They have hired people we?™ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ?œTesla Graveyard.??If you don?™t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I?™m not kidding.""

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.8% Y/Y in Q3 to nearly 71M units, a drop nearly as large as Q2's 11.8% and above a 9.2% projection. Gartner estimates shipments fell 7.7% to 73.7M.
IDC: ""Across many regions, the channel remained focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory before a more complete portfolio of models incorporating Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake processors comes on the scene ... Though easing a bit, currency devaluation continued to inhibit PC shipments in the third quarter. While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware.""
Nonetheless, IDC is ""optimistic"" about a demand pickup. ""While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware...""
Likewise, Gartner expects ""more stable market conditions"" in 2016. It's also pleased the U.S. notebook and ""premium ultramobile"" segments saw positive growth. Various analysts have reported seeing signs of stabilizing PC demand.
With tablet sales also under pressure, tablet cannibalization is less of an issue than before. The ability of older PCs to handle mainstream computing tasks without trouble (including on Windows 10) may be a bigger problem. Many in the industry are hoping 4K video and/or virtual reality will fuel upgrades.
The market's four biggest players all grabbed share from smaller firms with less scale. IDC estimates market leader Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) unit share rose 130 bps Y/Y to 21%, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) 110 bps to 19.6%, and #3 Dell's 120 bps 14.3%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), aided by 1H15 MacBook refreshes, came in at #4 with a 7.5% share, up 60 bps (revenue share is likely closer to 15%). A 4K 21.5"" iMac is reportedly launching next week.

""I can even imagine this working on the screen of a car."" His one beef is the 16 gigs of memory on the phone's entry-level model. While Apple says users aren't bumping up against that limit, Mossberg notes the new photos (the ""Live Photos"" feature) take up twice as much space as the previous pictures.
A fan of Live Photos, the NYT's Brian Chen is less enthusiastic about 3D Touch. He reckons the two new features aren't substantive enough to make it worth it for iPhone 6 users to upgrade.

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL +0.9%) has set a 2019 target launch date for its first electric car, and declared it to be a ""committed project."" Bloomberg previously reported the car could arrive by 2020.
The paper adds Apple, which has already hired a slew of high-profile auto execs and engineers for its Titan car project, has granted Titan's leaders permission to triple the project's 600-person team.
Though Apple has hired self-driving car experts and reportedly wants to produce a driverless vehicle over the long-term, its first car isn't expected to be fully autonomous. Details are scant on whether Apple will rely on manufacturing partners the way it does for the iPhone and various other products. Reuters reported this summer Apple execs toured BMW's German i3 manufacturing plant last year, but left without striking a deal.
Automobiles are arguably one of the few untapped markets big enough to significantly move the needle for Apple, whose FY15 (ends in September) revenue consensus stands at $233.1B.

Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has acquired Mapsense, a startup that provides companies and developers with tools for visualizing and analyzing large volumes of location-tagged data with the help of maps. Sources state the deal cost $25M-$30M.
Apple has made a string of mapping/location services-related acquisitions in recent years, as it works to improve Apple Maps (getting public transit directions via iOS 9). Past purchases include GPS service firm Coherent Navigation, transit app developers HopStop and Embark, and commercial mapping services firm BroadMap.
Separately, S&P CapIQ's Angelo Zino has upgraded Apple to Strong Buy, arguing the launch of annual iPhone upgrade plans directly sold by the company - they were announced at last week's event, and cost $32.41-$44.91/month depending on the model - is ""a notable positive.""
Zino: ""While AAPL?™s leasing program is unlikely to drive much additional demand, we believe it is having a direct effect on carriers as the likes of T-Mobile have already begun to offer new more attractive programs than AAPL?™s iPhone 6S/Plus program."" He also thinks upgrade program adoption will serve to boost iPhone ASPs.
SA author Anthony Ruben argued yesterday Apple's upgrade plans could lower the iPhone's average upgrade cycle time from an estimated 26 months. ""From AAPL's perspective, the emphasis has changed from keeping carrier partners happy to more tightly locking customers into the AAPL ecosystem. While there is much controversy surrounding the success of the Apple Watch, it's clear that one of the primary goals of the product is tightening the grip the company has on its customers.""

 With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes.

In Goldman's ""High Quality Stock"" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC.

With demand from Apple and Chinese mobile OEMs remaining strong, CEO Kaz Hirai Sony (SNE -3.1%) plans to invest ??.5B ($1.7B) in its image sensor ops in FY16 (ends March '16)? - 5x what it invested in FY15.
The remarks come as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gets set to launch the iPhone 6S/6S+, which are expected to feature much-improved cameras. The rear camera is rumored to support 12MP still photos, 4K video recording, and a faster burst mode; the front camera is reportedly being upgraded to 5MP.
Image sensors have been a strong point for Sony as it deals with weak smartphone and (PS4 excluded) home electronics sales. The company is believed to be taking share from OmniVision (OVTI +0.7%), which is expected by the Street to see its FY16 (ends April '16) sales drop 8.8% Y/Y.

In addition to the iPhone 6S/6S+ and a new Apple TV set-top, Apple's (AAPL +3.4%) Sep. 9 event will also feature the unveiling of the oft-rumored iPad Pro and a 4th-gen iPad Mini, ""trusted sources"" tell 9to5 Mac. A 3rd-gen iPad Air is also reportedly being prepped, but won't launch until 2016.
The Pro, previously rumored to have a 12.9"" display, will reportedly see pre-orders start in late October and fully launch in November. 9to5 states the device will support a Force Touch-based stylus and come with stereo speakers. The 4th-gen Mini is said to be thinner than its predecessor and run on an A8 CPU, and to ""likely"" feature upgraded cameras.
In June, Apple showed off iPad multitasking features (part of iOS 9) that would work well with a larger, business-focused, tablet. The Pro could provide a lift to broader iPad sales, which were down 23% Y/Y in calendar Q2 to $4.5B.

Also reported by 9to5: The iPhone 6S and 6S+ will retain the 6/6+'s 16/64/128GB storage tiers, as well as their subsidized launch prices. One hardware change: Apple is reportedly using the stronger 7000 series aluminum it first debuted with the Apple Watch.
Meanwhile, more details have been shared about the next-gen Apple TV (prior coverage). Sources tell BuzzFeed the device will start at $149 and contain a universal search feature that can query multiple video services. 9to5 Mac states the new Apple TV will have an A8 CPU, the same ports as the prior-gen model, and no 4K video support.
Apple is up strongly a day after dropping 4.5%. The Nasdaq is up 1.6%.

After previously aiming for a fall launch, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now looking to bring its Web TV service to market in 2016, Bloomberg reports. The delay is blamed on slow-moving licensing talks with TV networks such as CBS, NBC, and Fox, and the need for network capacity upgrades.
Re/code previously reported Apple's service might not launch until 2016 or late 2015. More recently, BuzzFeed reported the service wouldn't be announced at Apple's September iPhone event; a new Apple TV set-top is expected.
Bloomberg's sources suggest Apple wants to charge ~$40/month for its service. Dish's Sling TV service provides a limited number of channels for $20/month, while Sony's more expansive PlayStation Vue service goes for $50-$70/month.
Regarding network capacity, Apple (unsurprisingly) wants to improve quality and keep bandwidth costs down by using CDNs to stream content from data centers that are close to users.

""Our checks on the ground in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo suggest iPhone is enjoying robust consumer demand. However, given stock market worries (since late-June) in China, we would not be surprised if Apple was taking a more cautious view of end demand, and cutting iPhone-related orders in the supply chain.

Chinese income growth and an iPhone 6/6+ price cut (following the 6S launch) are also seen as catalysts.

He adds chip suppliers with strong Apple exposure are outperforming peers amid an industry downturn.
Nomura's Jeffrey Kvaal: ""Fears of broad order cancellations in Apple?™s supply chain driven by soft China demand appear exaggerated to us. Our Taiwan Technology team, led by Anne Lee, notes that some suppliers, such as Catcher, have not seen cancellations over the past month. Bottlenecks may defer demand slightly for some vendors, but stable orders and an on-track 6S launch suggest fears will be short lived ...

Citing ""sources close to Apple,"" Business Insider reports Apple (AAPL -2.5%) is ""privately trialing"" a U.S. mobile phone service, and is also in talks with European carriers to offer something similar. The services would be provided on an MVNO basis - Apple wouldn't build/own the underlying infrastructure, but obtain wholesale access from existing carriers.
BI cautions there's no guarantee the services will go beyond the test phase, and that Apple ""could take at least five years"" to do a full launch. The company has reportedly talked with carriers for years about the idea, so much so that sources call Apple's interest in launching an MVNO an ""open secret"" within the industry.
Launching MVNOs would extend Apple's control over the iPhone user experience to voice/data services, and allow it to experiment with new service plans/pricing. It could also trigger a backlash among carriers that find themselves competing with an Apple MVNO, and aren't getting wholesale revenue. However, the fact carriers would still have no other company to buy iPhones from could limit the fallout.
In April, Google launched a beta for its aggressively-priced Project Fi MVNO service, in partnership with Sprint and T-Mobile. However, for now, the service is only available via Google/Motorola Mobility's Nexus 6 phablet.
Shares have sold off amid a 0.8% decline for the Nasdaq. They're at their lowest levels since February.

 Some of the biggest and best known U.S. businesses join the Obama administration in trying to build momentum for a deal at the climate change summit in Paris later this year. A dozen publicly traded companies - AA, AAPL, MSFT, BAC, BRK.B, KO, GM, GS, GOOG, PEP, UPS and WMT - committed to support a ?œstrong"" outcome in  Paris, and made new pledges to take a variety of steps to tackle climate  change. For example, Alcoa says it will reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 50% by 2025, and BRK plans to retire 75% of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. In addition to company-specific goals, the White House says today's announcements total at least $140B in new low-carbon investment and more than 1,600 MW of new renewable energy.  ",,,

The Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be available at more than 100 Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) stores in the U.S. starting in August, and more than 300 locations before the holiday season, marking the first time the watch will be sold outside of the Apple retail store.

1773,"Apple sees downgrade, defenders following FQ3 report; shares -5.1%","Jul. 22, 2015, 12:15 PM","

Cowen has downgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Market Perform after the company beat FQ3 estimates, offered light FQ4 guidance, and reported slightly below-consensus iPhone sales. Others on the Street are reiterating their existing ratings (largely bullish).

Upbeat on Monday, Cowen's Tim Arcuri now thinks ""evidence of a widespread demand reset from China is mounting."" He cites not only FQ3 iPhone sales, but also Chinese auto sales figures and results from multiple chipmakers. In addition, Arcuri states field work suggests new iPhone builds are down relative to the past cycle for the first time. ""[W]hile we are very bullish about AAPL?™s ability to tap into a much broader and deeper demand opportunity for a price-reduced 6/6+ than prior 'old' models, this is a different narrative.""
UBS' Steve Milunovich (Buy): ""Our call that the phone ASP would be $660 was correct but we overestimated units, especially with channel inventory declining ... Despite seasonally low iPhone units, we believe Apple is building long-term value and maintain our $150 price target. Also, it is unclear if Sep guidance includes 6s sales to China, which were delayed into October last year.??
Canaccord's Mike Walkley (Buy): ""[W]e believe the current iPhone 6 and upcoming iPhone 6s should continue to post strong sales and high-end smartphone market share gains ... with only 27% of the iPhone installed base having upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus devices by [FQ3], we anticipate continued strong replacement sales through 2015.""
""As Apple has become the 'gold standard' of technology, it is held to a higher standard,"" argues FBR's Daniel Ives (Outperform). With Greater China revenue up 112% Y/Y in FQ3, he considers China concerns overblown, but wants to see more transparency regarding Watch sales.

Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounted for well over 100% of the $952M in annual revenue growth seen by Apple's Other Products segment in FQ3, CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call. Bloomberg observes Maestri's remarks point to 1.9M+ Watch sales, if one assumes a $499 ASP. (live blogs: WSJ, BI)
Tim Cook stated Watch sales were higher in June than in April or May. He once more declined to provide specific Watch revenue/unit figures, while asserting Apple has chosen not to do so to keep info out of competitors' hands.
He also once more defends the iPad (units -18% Y/Y to 10.9M), estimating Apple has 76% of the market for $200+ tablets and stating customer sell-through (11.2M) was better than sell-in thanks to a 300K-unit drop in channel inventories.
The iPhone (units +35% to 47.5M, but below a ~49M consensus) saw channel inventories fall by 600K Q/Q, bringing them to the low end of Apple's 5-7 week target range. Greater China iPhone sales were up 87% Y/Y and Mac sales 33%. 27% of iPhone users are said to have upgraded to a 6/6+.
Also: 1) A strong dollar had an 8% impact on revenue growth, and a $24 impact on iPhone ASP; the latter was still up $99 Y/Y, thanks in part to the 6+. 2) 89% of Apple's cash balance is offshore. 3) The retail store count is up to 456 (190 outside the U.S.). 4) 8,500 third-party Watch apps are now available.

Piper, Cantor, and Cowen have each released upbeat notes ahead of Tuesday afternoon's FQ3 report. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has risen to its highest levels since May 26, and is less than $2.50 away from an April 28 high of $134.54. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.
Piper's Gene Munster, bullish as ever, forecasts FQ3 EPS of $1.82, revenue of $50B, and iPhone sales of 49M-50M (moderately above consensus). ""To put 49 million in perspective, it would imply 39% y/y unit growth vs the Mar-15 quarter of 38% excluding 1 million in channel fill ... This acceleration reflects iPhone gaining share at the high-end of the market, a trend that we expect to continue throughout 2015."" He expects 17% iPhone unit growth for the whole of 2015, and flat growth in 2016.
Cantor's Brian White: ""During our Taiwan trip in early June, many of our contacts highlighted weak trend across the smartphone and notebook markets; however, we walked away pleased the tone for iPhones and Macs relative to our expectations ... we are raising our iPhone unit estimate to 48.5 million from 46.25 million ... but lowering our iPad projection to 9.5 million from 10.9 million units ... We are maintaining our Mac shipment forecast at 4.93 million units but increasing our Mac forecast for the September quarter.""
Cowen's Tim Arcuri: ""We model iPhone units 50MM (incl. 28MM 6 and 13MM 6+), above Street which seems 48-49MM. We raised ests in June ... but still see upward bias given 1) our latest field work suggesting ongoing cuts to supply chain for iPhone?™s high-end competition (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S6); 2) recent Cowen survey data showing increased iPhone penetration growth and meaningful future loyalty at key U.S. operators ... and 3) China sales which remain strong despite demand and stock market uncertainties.""
Wells Fargo's Maynard Um has also hiked his estimates, albeit while maintaining a Market Perform rating. ""We think [iPhone] unit upside could be driven by the 25 carriers added in the quarter ... as well as purposely building indirect channel inventory (ended last quarter at the low end of its 5-7 week target) ... We believe gross margin upside in this S-cycle may be offset by increased bill of materials and potential pricing actions at the lower end.""
Separately, research firm Wristly states a survey of Apple Watch owners found 66% were ""very satisfied/delighted"" with the device, and that 31% were ""somewhat satisfied"" with it.

A little over three months after downgrading to Hold - shares were at $125.49 at the time - SocGen's Andy Perkins has upgraded Apple (AAPL +1.1%) back to Buy, while keeping his target at $140. Shares are following markets higher.
Ahead of Apple's July 21 FQ3 report, Perkins has hiked his FQ3 iPhone sales estimate by 5M units to 48M. His revenue and EPS estimates for the quarter are respectively at $50.2B and $1.84, above a consensus of $49B and $1.78.
Discussing recent Chinese concerns, Perkins admits ""any slowdown in the Chinese economy, whether or not stemming from the recent stock market turmoil, could have an adverse impact."" He adds SocGen hasn't ""factored in any slowdown in [Chinese] iPhone sales,"" and thinks nearly a third of FQ3 iPhone sales came from China.
Regarding Apple Watch, Perkins states SocGen's data ""suggests an encouraging start for the new product,"" while cautioning the firm is ""finding it difficult to find corroborating evidence to support our figures."" The data points to 5M FQ3 Watch sales, 8M FY15 sales, and 19M FY16 sales. With FQ3 ASP estimated to be near $500, Perkins forecasts quarterly Watch revenue of ~$2.5B.
Separately, Digitimes - historically better at providing supply chain data than launch dates - reports suppliers are expected to begin shipping components for the rumored 12.9"" iPad in late September, and that the tablet is expected to become available after mid-November.
Apple is said to be ""rather cautious about placing related orders."" In June, the company unveiled iPad multitasking features (will arrive via iOS 9) that would work well with a 12.9"" iPad.

1781,Apple's dominance of profit almost complete,"Jul. 13, 2015, 2:58 AM","
 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) grabbed 92% of the operating profit of the world's top eight smartphone companies in Q1, financial firm Canaccord Genuity calculates, up from 65% a year earlier. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) took 15% in this year's period. The reason why Apple and Samsung earned over 100% combined is because some rivals only broke even or lost money. Apple's dominance of profit share comes despite the company selling under 20% of smartphones and because its devices are much more expensive than those of its competitors. The story is similar in the PC industry, although not as extreme. Apple enjoyed over half of industry profits last year despite its Mac line taking a market share of just 6%, Bernstein Research estimates.  ",,,
1782,IDC: PC sales fell 11.8% Y/Y in Q2,"Jul. 9, 2015, 10:02 PM","


IDC estimates global PC shipments tumbled to 66.1M in Q2, falling at a sharper Y/Y clip than Q1's 6.7% and about 1% faster than expected. Gartner is slightly less harsh, estimating shipments fell 9.5% to 68.4M.
Factors blamed for the decline: Inventory reductions ahead of the Windows 10 launch (set for July 29), a strong dollar (has led to higher overseas prices), and tough Y/Y comps caused by the 2014 boost in business PC sales caused by the end of Windows XP support. With tablet sales under pressure as well, tablet cannibalization is less of a factor than before ... but rising smartphone/tablet usage still appears to be taking a toll on PC upgrade rates.
Gartner sees full-year shipments falling 4.4%. IDC still expects low-to-mid single-digit declines in 2H15, before volumes stabilize in future years. It sees the Windows 10 launch going ""relatively well,"" but cautions Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to provide free upgrades to Windows 7/8 users will limit its impact on PC sales.
Continuing a recent trend, market leaders grabbed share from smaller rivals. IDC estimates #1 Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose to 20.3% from 19.4% a year ago, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) to 18.5% from 18.2%, and #3 Dell's to 14.5% from 14%. Acer (OTC:ASIYF) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) are respectively given 6.6% and 6.5% shares
Curiously, IDC has Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranked #4 globally, with its share rising to 7.8% from 5.9% via 5.1M Mac shipments (could imply a 15%+ revenue share), but Gartner doesn't have the company in its top-5. IDC and Gartner respectively assign Apple 13.5% and 12.7% U.S. shares. In the past, IDC's Mac shipment estimates have been notably different from the quarterly figures Apple would later report.
Near-term expectations for PC sales are already quite low, following Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q1 warning, AMD's Q2 warning, Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) June 25 results/guidance, and plenty of other negative news. Intel's Q2 report arrives on July 15.

Chinese macro fears fueled by the country's stock market crash are receiving plenty of ink. FBR's Daniel Ives: ?œChina is poised to be Apple's high-octane fuel for the next few years, especially for iPhones ... Given a lot of the dark clouds we are seeing in China, that has spooked investors.??Chinese stocks rose overnight after fresh attempts by regulators to halt the plunge
In an intraday note, Goldman cited Chinese worries as one of four potential factors weighing on shares, along with reports of soft Watch demand, a buyback blackout period, and sales by hedge funds and mutual funds.
UBS, meanwhile, issued a note (.pdf) stating checks point to strong FQ3 (calendar Q2) Chinese iPhone sales. The firm admitted ""a slowing Chinese economy is a risk,"" but downplayed fears a market crash will have a big macro impact, given equities account for only 20% of household wealth (12%-13% if one counts property). Thanks partly to pent-up demand for larger iPhones, Apple's Greater China revenue rose 71% Y/Y in FQ2 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue).

Apple (AAPL -1.8%) wants contract manufacturers to produce 85M-90M 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhone 6S units by year's end, the WSJ reports. A year ago, the company initially asked for 70M-80M iPhone 6 units.
The WSJ reiterates the next-gen iPhones are expected to feature Force Touch haptic sensors, and that Apple might provide a fourth color option - the paper previously reported the color to be pink.
A third contract manufacturer - Wistron - might join Foxconn and Pegatron in producing 6S units. Assuming demand matches, strong iPhone builds would be a positive for audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS -3.9%), which continues to get well over half its revenue from Apple.
Other Apple news: 1) A federal judge has thrown out a $533M damages award against Apple levied by a jury that ruled iTunes infringed 3 patents owned by private SmartFlash LLC. A new damages trial will start on Sep. 14. 2) Ahead of Apple's July 21 FQ3 report, Credit Suisse ($145 target) has hiked its iPhone estimates, and cut its iPad estimates. The firm now expects 250M calendar 2015 iPhone sales , with the 6+ accounting for 27% of all units.
Apple is selling off amid a 1.4% drop for the Nasdaq. Many tech names with strong Chinese exposure are underperforming; concerns have been aired about the impact of a Chinese stock market crash on consumer demand.

Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves: ""Although we continue to expect iPhone (AAPL +0.6%) sales to decline in the coming refresh cycle, ongoing share gains should prevent the decline from being as severe as we previously expected ... We believe the majority of people earning $15,000 a year or more in the world will own an iPhone exiting F2015."" His FY15 (ends Sep.

""Store visits, Google search volume, third-party data and recent supply checks all suggest demand for Apple Watch has fallen sharply from initial levels."" He previously noted Apple Watch Google search activity is trailing the iPod's. Research firm Slice has estimated 2.79M U.S. Watch sales as of mid-June.
With the iPhone accounting for the lion's share of Apple's gross profit, Hargreaves, who has maintained a Sector Perform rating since last September, has upped his FY15 and FY16 EPS estimates by $0.28 and $0.34 to $9.41 and $9.29. Consensus is at $9.03 and $9.72.
Separately, 9to5 Mac has leaked pictures said to depict the iPhone 6S' case and circuit board. The pictures indicate the 6S will use Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.2%) MDM9x35 baseband modem, first announced in late 2013 and found in some Galaxy S5/S6 units. It has twice the peak download speed (300Mbps) of the MDM9x25 modem used in the iPhone 6/6+, and better power consumption. The MDM9x45, which tops out at 450Mbps, was unveiled last November ahead of 2015 commercial availability.
In-line with Apple's past ""S"" model upgrades, the leaked photos suggest the 6S will look similar to the 6 on the outside. Any difference in thickness/width for 4.7"" models is reportedly ""too minimal to notice.""

A study by Piper's Gene Munster of U.S. and Chinese iPhone resale values (on eBay and Alibaba's Taobao site, respectively) indicates the iPhone 6 and 6+ (AAPL +1.7%) are commanding higher prices than the 5S and 5C did a year ago.
Following 281 days of availability the 6 and 6+ are both selling in the U.S. at 72% of their MSRPs, compared with 60% and 48% from the 5S and 5C at the same point in time. Following 253 days in China, the 6 and 6+ are going for 73% of their MSRPs vs. 65% and 53% for the 5S and 5C at a similar point. Of note: iPhone 6/6+ anticipation (many rumors mentioned larger screens) may have affected year-ago 5S/5C resale prices.
Munster sees the numbers as evidence iPhone 6 demand remains strong. ""We believe iPhone will continue to gain share at the high end smart phone market, which, despite tough comps starting in Dec-15, should move shares of AAPL higher.""
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty reports her firm's AlphaWise Tracker (relies on Web search data) indicates FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone end-user demand totals 53M, above consensus shipment estimates and an MS forecast of 50M. ""This is unchanged from our read a month ago. Emerging markets, especially China, remain the driver of growth late in the product cycle.""
Huberty also states AlphaWise indicates Apple Watch demand is ~20% above that or the original iPhone 6 weeks following its launch. ""Net, we see the potential for improved distribution in C2H15 and improved Watch 2.0 features in 2016 to help capture demand implied by our recent AlphaWise survey and tracker data.""
The iPhone accounted for 69% of Apple's FQ2 revenue, and a larger percentage of its gross profit. Today's gains come as the Nasdaq trades near breakeven.

1793,"Report: Apple Watch 2 set to have FaceTime camera, iPhone-free data use","Jun. 18, 2015, 2:58 PM","

Apple (AAPL +0.6%) currently plans to have a camera built into the second-gen Watch's front bezel to let users make and receive FaceTime video calls, reports 9to5 Mac's Mark Gurman in his latest iScoop. He adds Apple's recently-unveiled watchOS 2.0 (will launch this fall) ""allows users to answer FaceTime Audio calls from the Apple Watch, as well as route FaceTime video calls to either be answered on an iPhone or rejected.""
The device will also reportedly be able to receive texts, e-mails, and other data solely through its Wi-Fi radio. The current Apple Watch requires Bluetooth or Wi-Fi pairing with an iPhone.
The battery is expected to be similar to the current Watch's, with Apple turning to ""more advanced hardware features"" to improve battery life. While reviewers have been critical of battery life, Gurman reports Apple's research indicates ""average consumers finish each day with between 30% and 40% charge remaining on their Apple Watches."" Apple has officially estimated the Watch's battery lasts 18 hours under ""typical"" use.
Also: Apple is reportedly ""exploring a wider portfolio of Apple Watch models beyond today?™s Sport, Steel, and Edition tiers,"" while ""looking at ways to attract customers at price points between $1,000 and $10,000."" In-line with Apple's traditional upgrade cycles, the second-gen Watch is deemed ""most likely"" to arrive in 2016.
Separately, research firm Slice (relying on e-commerce receipts) estimates U.S. Watch sales totaled 2.79M as of mid-June, up moderately from an estimated ~2.5M as of May 18. The Apple Watch Sport (starts at $349) is believed to be the most popular model, and an estimated 17% of owners bought more than one (high-margin) band.

 TechCrunch states Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been stepping up its efforts to grow enterprise sales, is working with enterprise mobility management (EMM) software vendor MobileIron (NASDAQ:MOBL) to ""help deploy applications into the enterprise.""

MobileIron CEO Bob Tinker tells TechCrunch his company is ""excited to be working with Apple,"" and makes note of his company's OneTouch iOS app-deployment/management software.

1795,Criteo -5.6%; Apple plans to support ad-blockers on Mobile Safari,"Jun. 11, 2015, 10:42 AM","

""The new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS. Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content,"" writes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its developer documentation for iOS 9 (launching this fall).

StatCounter estimates Safari had a 24.9% global mobile/tablet browsing share in May, trailing only Google Chrome's 30.8% ... and Safari's share of the high-income consumers beloved by advertisers is likely larger, given Apple's customer demographics.
Content publishers aren't thrilled with Apple's plans to support 3rd-party ad-blockers. NiemanLab's Joshua Benton: ""Publishers already make tiny dollars on mobile, even as their readers have shifted there in huge numbers ... If iOS users ??the majority of mobile web users in the U.S., and disproportionately appealing demographically ??can suddenly block all your ads with a simple free download, where is the growth going to come from?""
Benton also notes Apple's support for cookie-blocking could prevent content paywalls from working. At the same time, he admits ""bandwidth and performance and battery life are all at a premium"" on mobile, and that many ads act as a big resource drain.
Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO), whose e-commerce ad platform relies on cookies to deliver retargeted ads to users on PC and mobile sites, is selling off (hat tip: Marc Lehman). Other ad tech plays don't appear to be affected much by the news for now. Apple's move follows remarks by Tim Cook arguing Apple places a greater value on consumer privacy and data protection than Google and other rivals. Android already supports ad-blockers.

The attorneys general of New York and Connecticut are now investigating whether the deals struck by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its new music service violated antitrust rules.
The joint investigation will probe whether Apple pressured music labels - or whether the labels conspired with Apple and one another - to withdraw support for popular ""freemium"" services like Spotify in favor of its new paid streaming music service.
Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut's George Jepsen were also among a group of attorneys generals who in 2013 sued Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books. Apple agreed to pay $450M as part of that settlement.

 The much-rumored Apple Music (AAPL -0.5%) subscription service has been unveiled, and so has a radio station (Beats 1) featuring live DJs. Jimmy Iovine trumpets Apple Music's emphasis on human curation (algorithms will also be used), and a service (called Music Connect) meant to connect fans with artists. Apple Music will launch on June 30 in over 100 countries, and come with a 3-month free trial. Beyond that, it costs $9.99/month for individual plans (similar to rivals), and $14.99/month for family plans (up to 6 members). Android support arrives in the fall. Pandora (P -3.4%) remains lower on the day. Apple's iOS 9 News app aims to take on Flipboard and other mobile reader apps with the help of curated content from partners such as ESPN, Conde Nast, BuzzFeed, the NYT, Bloomberg, and The Verge. Much like other reader apps, News will analyze reading habits to better personalize content over time. Confirming a May rumor, the iPad is getting multitasking support via iOS 9: Swiping or pulling down an app from the side brings up other apps (SlideOver), with iPad Air 2 users (and perhaps in the future ~12"" iPad users?) also able to simultaneously work on two apps (SplitView). Also: A picture-in-picture mode for video is also being added. watchOS 2 supports native 3rd-paty apps, lets Apple Watch users create various custom photo faces, and lets developers create ""Complications"" that mash up different types of info. New Siri controls are also included, as is an updated Mail app and a Nightstand Mode. Other announcements: 1) Apple Pay is adding support for retail rewards cards. 2) CarPlay is adding wireless support, and HomeKit support for more home devices. 3) The Maps app is being updated to support public transit directions. 4) Apple has unveiled the next-gen version of its Swift programming language (Swift 2), and is making Swift open-source. 5) Cumulative App Store downloads have topped 100B; Apple states the average user has 119 apps. As expected, iOS 9 will officially launch in the fall (i.e. the time that new iPhones typically launch). watchOS 2 also formally launches in the fall.

Apple (AAPL -0.9%) has kicked off WWDC by unveiling Mac OS X 10.11 (codenamed El Capitan). The OS contains a slew of nuts-and-bolts UI and feature improvements, such as cursor and Spotlight search panel resizing, the auto-arranging of app windows (similar to Windows' Snap feature), and natural-language search integration.
Performance gains are also promised: Apple claims apps launch up to 40% faster than on OS X Yosemite, and (with the help of the Metal GPU API) graphics rendering efficiency is improved up to 40%. A developer beta is available today; a public beta arrives in July, and the OS becomes officially available as a free upgrade in the fall.
The rumored Proactive assistant (a part of iOS 9) has been unveiled. The Google Now rival leverages Siri and a user's data to push time/location-sensitive content, and make content/app suggestions. Meanwhile, an API is being provided for Spotlight (integrated with Proactive) to allow content within apps to be surfaced. Google has long been a supporter of the concept, known as deep linking.
Confirming a recent Telegraph report, Apple Pay will launch in the U.K. next month. In addition, mobile card-reader giant Square will launch a new reader this fall that supports Apple Pay. Trader Joe's and J.C. Penney have been added to the list of merchants supporting the platform.
Also: 1) As rumored, Apple is adding support for native 3rd-party Watch apps (i.e. apps that don't need iPhone pairing) through a new Watch SDK. 2) Tim Cook states 55% of active Mac users are now on Yosemite (launched last year). 3) Bloomberg reports Apple (already known to be building out a CDN) is building a long-haul fiber network to connect its data centers, in order to speed content delivery. 4) Apple's Passbook app has been renamed Wallet.

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) new mobile phone payment service, Android Pay, will not garner any transaction fees from credit card companies, WSJ reports, possibly putting pressure on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to drop or lower its charges for Apple Pay.
Dominant payment networks, Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA), recently standardized their ""tokenization"" card-security service and made it free, preventing payment services from charging fees to issuers.
""This is a bold move on behalf of the banks,"" said Rick Oglesby, head of research at Double Diamond Payments Research. After agreeing to Apple's terms for Apple Pay, ""they?™re now taking a stand against similar deals. It could easily turn into a standoff.""
Apple Pay currently receives 0.15% of the value of each credit card transaction and collects a half-cent per purchase on bank debit cards.

Apple (AAPL +0.4%) is expected to unveil its new subscription music streaming service (a revamped version of the existing Beats Music service) at the June 8-12 WWDC conference, the WSJ reports.
It adds the service will be priced at $10/month, on par with Spotify and many other rival services. Prior reports indicated Apple was hoping to undercut rivals, potentially by charging ~$8/month. A 9to5 Mac report also stated the service would be offered through both the iOS Music app and a standalone Android app (the first developed by Apple).
Also: Apple plans to update its iTunes Radio service (available either on a free/ad-supported basis, or for $25/year ad-free via iTunes Match) to include ""channels programmed and hosted by human DJs."" Pandora (P -2%) has fallen moderately in response.
Apple reportedly hasn't yet reached licensing deals for the subscription service with Universal Music, Sony, and Warner Music, but the WSJ adds ""many in the music industry expect such deals soon.""

Proactive will reportedly replace Apple's Spotlight search feature - a dedicated search bar will be included - and be placed to the left of a user's Home screen.

Also: 1) In addition to an augmented reality view, Maps will be given a ""Browse Around Me"" button that shows points of interest on an overhead map. 2) A Siri API codenamed Breadcrumbs will be provided to 3rd-party developers; its features will be limited due to privacy concerns.
The report comes less than a year after Apple replaced Google with Bing as Spotlight's default search provider via iOS 8; Google remains the Safari browser's default provider.? Sources tell 9to5 Google's iOS traffic has dropped since the iOS 8 launch.

Re/code, which was the first to report Apple (AAPL +0.8%) plans to launch a Web TV service, now reports Apple wants to include ""widespread access"" to local U.S. TV channels, a feature not provided by Dish and Sony's offerings.
Apple's efforts are said to have ""complicated its negotiations with the broadcast TV networks, because most broadcasters don?™t own all their local stations."" Some execs also state broadcasters will have to invest in streaming infrastructure to support local feeds.
As a result, the service might not launch in early fall, the target date Apple has given programmers. However, TV execs think it will eventually launch, and that money (rather than technical issues) is the main hurdle. The WSJ reported earlier this week Apple hopes to unveil the service at WWDC next month ahead of a fall launch.
Separately, research firm Slice estimates (based on an analysis of online sales receipts) U.S. Apple Watch orders have generally been below 30K/day (implies a quarterly run rate of ~2.7M) following big early sales. Altogether, Slice thinks Apple sold nearly 2.5M Watches in the U.S. from April 10 (the day pre-orders started) through May 18.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo recently cut his 2015 Apple Watch shipment forecast to 15M (others have forecast 20M-30M), citing a lack of major changes to shipment times in spite of supply constraints. Kuo also estimated ~80% of Watch orders are for the larger 42mm models.

 After close to a decade of research, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""quietly shelved plans"" to launch a TV set more than a year ago, the WSJ reports. Apple reportedly planned to make a 4K (Ultra HD) set, and considered including sensor-equipped cameras for making video calls. But it ultimately decided the TV's features wouldn't be ""compelling enough"" to enter a highly competitive market.

Carl Icahn's latest Apple (AAPL +1.1%) target (disclosed in a new letter) is up $24 from a $216 target set in February, and $37 from a $203 target set in October.
Whereas Icahn's $216 target was based on a multiple of 20x expected FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS of $9.70 + $22/share in net cash, his $240 target is based on 18x expected FY16 EPS of $12.00 (exc. net interest income) + $24.44/share in net cash. The FY16 estimate, well above a $9.64 consensus, assumes a 20% tax rate rather than Apple's reported 26.2% ""effective"" tax rate (recognizes taxes on offshore profits).
Icahn, optimistic as ever: ""Considering our forecast for 30% EPS growth in FY 2017 and our belief Apple will soon enter two new markets (Television and the Automobile) with a combined addressable market size of $2.2 trillion, we think a multiple of 18x is a very conservative premium ... we believe the company?™s shares should trade at a premium multiple to the S&P 500, as opposed to the S&P 500 trading at a 60% premium to Apple.""
He sees iPhone sales growth falling to the single digits in FY16/17, but also expects iPad growth to resume and Apple Watch sales to hit $45B in FY17. Though Apple hasn't announced a TV set (nor has one been reported to be close), $37.5B worth of FY17 TV sales are forecast.
Not surprisingly, Icahn once more calls for a larger buyback - Apple recently hiked its buyback authorization by $50B to $140B, and raised $8B to help pay for capital returns. ""[D]espite more than 30% growth in R&D annually through FY 2017 to $13.5 billion ... and your updated capital return program, Apple?™s net cash position (currently the largest of any company in history) will continue to build on the balance sheet.""

A federal appeals court (the CAFC) has upheld the patent infringement violations found by a San Jose jury in Apple's (AAPL +0.4%) 2012 infringement suit against Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). However, it has reversed the $382M in trade dress dilution damages awarded to Apple (part of the $930M awarded overall), which will now be reconsidered by the San Jose court.Apple and Samsung's bitter legal war has been gradually dying down: Last year, the companies agreed to drop all suits outside of the U.S. That occurred shortly after Apple was awarded $120M in a U.S. infringement suit (separate from the 2012 complaint), much less than the $2B it originally sought.Separately, Whale Wisdom's Daniel Collins reports (following a review of Q1 13F filings) the number of Apple shares held by firms with over $100M under management fell by 4% in Q1 to 3.38B. 1,064 firms cut their positions, and 862 added to theirs; 121 created new positions, and 69 closed out.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management were among the major hedge funds to cut their Apple stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors liquidated its stake, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates upped its position. Carl Icahn's position was unchanged at 52.8M shares.Overall, 2,193 13F filers owned $421B worth of Apple shares - both figures are market highs. 1,186 firms counted Apple as a top-10 holding. ",,,

Coherent Navigation provided high-precision GPS services (known as iGPS) that pair standard GPS signals with those from Iridium's (NASDAQ:IRDM) low-earth orbit satellite constellation to offer superior accuracy, signal integrity, and jamming protection. Whereas standard GPS is typically accurate to within several meters, Iridium and Boeing have claimed iGPS? can be accurate to within centimeters.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought Coherent for an undisclosed sum. The purchase? follows several 2013 acquisitions aimed at improving Apple Maps: Wi-Fi indoor positioning startup WiFiSlam, business/POI location database provider Locationary, commercial mapping services firm BroadMap, and public transit app developers HopStop, and Embark. More recently, Apple appears to have launched an effort to add street imagery similar to Google Maps' Street View.
Tim Cook disclosed in March Apple had bought 26 companies in the prior 15 months. As a list of Apple's known acquisitions shows, many of the purchases still haven't been made public.

After growing 19.1% Y/Y in Q4 (and seeing stronger growth earlier in 2014),? Chinese smartphone shipments fell 4.3% in Q1 to 98.8M units, per IDC. Higher penetration rates, carrier subsidy cuts, and an inventory buildup near the end of 2014 contributed to the drop.
IDC: ""China is oftentimes thought of as an emerging market but the reality is that the vast majority of phones sold in China today are smartphones ... convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth in the China market.""
Analysts have already noted Chinese smartphone demand has softened. Demand is expected to improve in 2H15, as inventories are cleared and 4G phone sales continue growing. IDC expects ""relatively flat"" growth for the whole of 2015.
With strong pent-up demand for larger iPhones providing a lift, IDC estimates Apple's (AAPL -0.9%) share rose to 14.7% (#1 overall) from 12.3% in Q4 and 8.7% a year ago, via 14.5M shipments (+62% Y/Y). Revenue share was likely well over 30%, given sub-$150 Android phones account for a large portion of local sales. Apple, for its part, has reported its Greater China revenue (iPhone or otherwise) rose 71% Y/Y in Q1 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue).
Xiaomi continues growing rapidly: IDC estimates its share rose to 13.7% (#2) from 9.2% a year ago. Fellow local Android OEM Huawei saw its share rise to 11.4% (#3) from 7.8%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), however, saw its share fall to 9.7% from 19.9% ahead of the Galaxy S6 launch. Lenovo/Motorola's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share fell to 8.3% (#5) from 10.3%.

Three months after selling $6.5B worth of debt, Apple (AAPL +0.8%) has sold another $8B, while stating it plans to use the proceeds to help pay for dividends/buybacks.
Interest rates were low, but (thanks to a bond market selloff) higher than the rates often obtained in prior deals: Whereas 30-year (2045) bonds sold in February were priced to yield 3.498% (125 bps above comparable Treasurys), 30-year bonds sold in the latest offering were priced to yield 4.397% (140 bps above comparable Treasurys). 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2025 notes have also been offered. (prospectus)
The offering comes after Apple hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.52/share last week, and upped its buyback authorization by $50B to $140B. The company had $193.5B in cash/investments at the end of March, but over $171B was offshore. Debt totaled nearly $44B.
SA author Rubicon Associates considers the debt attractive relative to offerings from blue-chip tech peers, and (based on an analysis of Apple's peer credit curve) views the 2022 and 2025 notes as the most attractive. ""Bottom line: I find the new debt cheap to peers and existing Apple debt.""

The teardown also uncovered a 6-axis STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) motion sensor (accelerometer/gyproscope). There has been some debate about whether InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) will be a motion sensor supplier for the Watch, as it is for the iPhone 6.
Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) supplies a touch controller IC. Barclays reported in March ADI had scored multiple design wins to enable Apple's Force Touch pressure-based response feature (supported by the Watch) on future iPhones/iPads.
IDT (NASDAQ:IDTI) supplies a wireless charging IC. The design win comes after Samsung opted to use a Texas Instruments charging IC within the Galaxy S6; IDC supplies a chip for the S6's charging pad. Dialog Semi (OTCPK:DLGNF) provides a power management chip.
SanDisk/Toshiba (SNDK) supply an 8GB NAND flash chip, and Micron/Elpida (NASDAQ:MU) a 4Gb (512MB) SRAM chip. SRAM typically carries higher ASPs than DRAM for a given amount of capacity (it's also faster).
In the near-term (and perhaps longer), Watch volumes will likely amount to a small fraction of iPhone volumes - whereas Apple sold 192.7M iPhones in 2014, IDC forecasts 15.9M 2015 Watch shipments, and more bullish estimates are still generally in the ~20M range. However, strong growth is expected over the next several years, and the first-gen Watch serves as a valuable reference win when competing for other smartwatch/wearable designs.

The WSJ reports AAC Technologies, one of the two suppliers of the Apple Watch's (NASDAQ:AAPL) taptic engine (enables its haptic feedback features) was making defective components, and thus slowed down the ramping of Watch production. No recall is planned, since Apple doesn't believe Watches with the defective part shipped to consumers.
Apple has reportedly responded by moving nearly all of its taptic engine production to Japan's Nidec, which didn't encounter the same issue. However, the WSJ states ""it may take time"" for Nidec to up production, and that Apple told some Watch suppliers last week to ""slow production until June.""
The report comes as shipping times for many Watch models remain lengthy; a survey from research firm Slice indicated only 22% of U.S. Watch orders were delivered during the first weekend (376K out of 1.7M).
In its FQ2 10-Q, Apple discloses the European Commission ""could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years,"" and that such tax payments could be ""material."" The EC has long been probing the use of Irish legal structures by Apple and other U.S. multinationals to lower their local tax bills; the FT reported last year Apple could receive a fine of up to several billions of euros.

IDC estimates Apple's 61.2M calendar Q1 iPhone sales were good for an 18.2% global smartphone unit share, up from 15.2% a year ago; revenue share is likely above 40%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) had an estimated 24.5% unit share (82.4M shipments), down from 30.7% a year ago. #3 Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) fell to 5.6% from 6.6% after factoring the Motorola Mobility deal.

Apple (AAPL +0.3%) is up slightly after beating FQ2 estimates, offering in-line FQ3 guidance, and upping its dividend and buyback authorization. At least 9 firms have hiked their targets; no upgrades or downgrades have arrived.
Brean's Ananda Baruah (target hiked to $170) thinks Street estimates remain ""materially low"" through 2017, given iPhone unit growth, the margin boost provided by a mix shift towards iPhones and (within iPhone sales) the 6+, and operating expense leverage. He forecasts iPhone shipments and EPS respectively rising to 285M and $12.73 by FY17 (ends Sep. '17).
Citi's Jim Suva, who added Apple to Citi's Focus List 4 weeks ago, still sees carrier upgrade plans, low multiples, margin expansion, Apple Pay/Passbook, and enterprise growth acting as catalysts. Canaccord's Mike Walkley (target hiked to $155) sees the iPhone installed base growing to 500M this year.
Those offering more cautious takes often question the sustainability of iPhone growth. Nomura states sales growth in developed markets appears to have fallen in half in FQ2, and expects Chinese growth to slow the way Japanese growth has. Raymond James' Tavis McCourt (recently downgraded to Market Perform) also expects slowing iPhone growth, and (given a $171B+ offshore cash balance) thinks major foreign acquisitions are possible in the absence of a tax holiday.
Returning to Twitter after a 5-week hiatus, Carl Icahn says he still considers Apple ""undervalued and misunderstood,"" and expects to ""put out another in-depth report within two weeks."" His last report (involved a $216 target) was published in February.

About 20% of the iPhone installed base has upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus, Tim Cook states on the FQ2 call. He adds Apple has seen a higher rate of switchers from other platforms than in previous iPhone cycles, and that a large number of first-time buyers of the iPhone (69% of FQ2 revenue) still come from emerging markets. (live blogs: BI, WSJ)
No numbers have been given for early Apple Watch sales. Cook does note demand is higher than supply (previous), and that over 3,500 Watch apps are now available. ""Customer response is close to 100% positive from what I've seen."" The device will is expected to launch in more markets in late June.
Cook also talked up Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chinese performance (Greater China sales +71% and 29% of total revenue). In addition to iPhone 6 sales, local demand was lifted by higher Mac and (in spite of weakness elsewhere) iPad sales, and a 100%+ increase in Chinese App Store revenue. 70% of Chinese iPad buyers and 40% of U.S. buyers are first-time.
Multiple analysts asked about Apple's FQ3 gross margin guidance (38.5%-39.5% vs. a year-ago GM of 39.4%) CFO Luca Maestri states Watch margins (below the company average for now) will have an impact, as will a strong dollar (affecting many U.S. multinationals).
Other details: 1) Over $171B of Apple's $193.5B cash/investment balance is offshore. 2) iPhone channel inventory rose by 1M Q/Q, but is at the low end of Apple's target range. iPad inventory fell by 1.1M. 3) Cook thinks the iPhone and Mac are cannibalizing iPad sales. 4) Total emerging markets revenue (much of it from China) was up 58% Y/Y.

Apple (AAPL -0.5%) is ""in negotiations with Canada?™s six biggest banks about a potential November launch"" of Apple Pay, the WSJ reports. As in the U.S., both credit and debit cards would be supported.
However, Canadian banks are said to be unhappy with Apple's fee proposals and ""concerned about security vulnerabilities like the ones that U.S. banks experienced as they rolled out the service."" Talks are ongoing.
Canalys estimates the iPhone has a third of the Canadian smartphone market. Thus far, Apple Pay has only launched in the U.S.; in February, MarketWatch reported talks with state-owned Chinese credit/debit card operator UnionPay had stalled. Talks with U.K. banks (and bank concerns about data collection) were reported in December.
With Apple reportedly getting $0.15 on every $100 of credit transactions (and half a cent on debit transactions), Apple Pay is seen less as a direct revenue growth driver than as a means of strengthening the iOS ecosystem and boosting customer loyalty. The company has made plenty of positive remarks about early usage, but hasn't broken out total transaction volumes.
Separately, FBR's Daniel Ives has launched coverage with an Outperform rating and $185 target. He sees a growing services focus, rising Chinese and enterprise penetration, and new device categories (inc. wearables) acting as growth drivers, and argues Apple's software differentiation should help it achieve a $1T market cap in the face of mobile hardware commoditization.
Ives: ""Apple attracts its customers by leveraging the benefits of its closed software ecosystem ... Overall, while we estimate 24% and 6% [Y/Y] revenue growth for FY15 and FY16, respectively, we believe Apple can improve its strong market position and impressive gross margins over the coming years.""

""We continue to believe comps in FY16 will be quite difficult, while early reviews on Apple Watch suggest it will fall far short of the 'insanely great' benchmark, at least in this first iteration,"" writes Raymond James' Tavis McCourt, downgrading Apple (AAPL +0.1%) to Market Perform.
McCourt, who has a $124 target, is nonetheless upping his FY15/FY16 estimates. He notes ""data points suggest iPhone demand remained strong y/y through March, especially in China, and is now starting to enter its normal seasonal slowdown in calendar 2Q.""
Regarding Apple Watch, McCourt states a March survey of iPhone users found only 5% intending to buy one, down from nearly 10% in December. ""[W]e are concerned that relatively muted reviews so far could place added fear in investors??minds about the company?™s ability to launch successful new product categories."" His call comes two days after SocGen downgraded to Hold.
While McCourt downgrades, Canaccord's Mike Walkley has upped his target by $5 to $150, following positive survey data. ""While our recent surveys indicated strong initial interest for the new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphones could slow iPhone premium tier share gains during the June quarter, our March surveys indicated another strong quarter of market share gains for Apple."" Cantor reported seeing strong March iPhone supplier sales on Tuesday.
Walkley forecasts ""the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle will result in the installed iPhone base reaching 500M during C2015,"" and sees 20M 2015 Watch sales (4% of the iPhone base).
Meanwhile, following the start of Apple Watch pre-orders today, U.S. shipping times for most models have slipped to either ""4-6 weeks"" or ""June."" The official launch date for Watch sales is April 24.
It isn't clear to what extent the shipping push-outs stem from strong demand vs. limited supplies. Cowen and others have previously reported of Watch supply constraints.

Update: Piper's Gene Munster: ""We believe that the current stable lead times suggests that supply was the main limiting factor in this morning?™s sell out ... Given the quick sell-out, it seems less likely that Apple will be able to deliver 1 million units of stock on opening weekend, although we still believe there could be 1 million units of demand by April 24th sold via pre-order.""

Gartner estimates shipments fell 5.2% to 71.7M. With IDC also reporting of price pressure, revenue declines might be larger.

Gartner thinks sales of? ""mobile PCs"" (notebooks, convertibles, and Windows tablets) rose, while desktop sales fell sharply. ""PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality.""
Both Gartner and IDC report U.S. PC shipments fell only ~1% Y/Y. On the other hand, IDC thinks Japan (another high-ASP market) saw shipments fall 44%; strong Q1 2014 spending prior to a tax hike made for tough comps.
Market leaders Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) continued taking share from firms with less scale: IDC estimates Lenovo's share rose to 19.6% from 17.6% a year ago (3.4% unit growth), and HP's to 19% from 17.1% (3.3% unit growth).
#3 Dell's share rose to 13.5% from 13.4%; #4 Asus (OTC:ASUUY) was flat at 7.1%, and #5 Acer (OTC:ASIYF) rose to 7% from 6.3%. Everyone else collectively fell to 33.9% from 38.4%.
Unlike in Q4 and Q3 (seasonally stronger quarters for the company), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't in the global top-5. IDC estimates the company's US. unit share rose to 10.9% from 10.6%, good for fourth place (revenue share is higher).

1836,Apple Watch reviews arrive; SocGen downgrades to Hold,"Apr. 8, 2015, 12:27 PM","

Initial Apple Watch (AAPL - unchanged) reviews are positive, but not glowing. ""You'll Want One, but You Don't Need One,"" reads Bloomberg's headline. The Verge gives it 7/10 stars; CNET gives it 3.5/5. ""Gonna Be Juuuuuuust Nice Enough To Get Embargoed on Apple Watch 2 Next Year,"" quips Wired's Brian Barrett.
The Verge's Nilay Patel calls Apple Watch ""the most capable smartwatch available today"" after thoroughly going over a day of use. He likes the potential of its Taptic Engine, and enjoyed using Apple Pay. But he's also critical of its performance - ""[T]he Apple Watch, as I reviewed it for the past week and a half, is kind of slow."" - and thinks more options are needed to customize notifications and taptics.

Yahoo's David Pogue (formerly with the NYT) likes the Passbook, Remote, and Workout apps (among others), and the ability to quickly reply to texts with pre-typed responses and animated emojis. He thinks navigation and battery life remain weaknesses. ""Nobody needs a smartwatch ... [T]he Apple Watch is, above all, a satisfying indulgence.""
Bloomberg's Joshua Topolsky (formerly with The Verge) doesn't like the fact the clock isn't visible (to save battery life) when the Watch isn't engaged - ""As a normal watch-wearer, the idea that I might look down at my wrist and not see the time was annoying."" - and also thinks the Watch can be more distracting than an iPhone. He does call the hardware ""beautiful in a surgical way,"" and admits ""checking text messages and e-mails by quickly glancing at the watch saved me some time.""

The WSJ's Joanna Stern suggests most consumers should wait for the next model.  ""The body is bound to get thinner ... Soon, we won?™t have to charge the  battery every night, the software won?™t ever get stuttery and those  health sensors will get even more accurate.""

Techpinions' Ben Bajarin provides one of the more upbeat takes. ""The Apple Watch became my primary notification panel/dashboard ... In many ways the Apple Watch untethered me from my iPhone the way the iPhone untethered me from my PC ... Ultimately what I am convinced of is the Apple Watch represents a completely new computer interaction model.""
Meanwhile, SocGen's Andy Perkins has downgraded Apple to Hold. He thinks a mix shift away from the iPhone 6/6+ and 128GB models will lead Apple's iPhone ASP to drop to $651 in calendar Q1 from Q4's $687, and is also concerned about forex and tough 2H15 comps.

1837,HBO Now rolls out via Apple and Cablevision,"Apr. 7, 2015, 4:08 PM","
 With five days to spare before the season premiere of hit Game of Thrones, HBO Now (NYSE:TWX) has opened for business on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC). The Verge notes that overall, it's what you'd expected: HBO without the pay-TV subscription. HBO has included language in its agreement to change the number of streams/devices that subscribers can use, a sure hedge against password sharing. A nice benefit: For library content (which includes 2,000 titles), HBO will tell you the exact date when licensed films will be leaving the service so you can plan Other than that, it looks quite similar to HBO Go, its existing ""TV Everywhere"" approach for authenticated pay-TV subscribers. In her detailed recounting of the path to developing HBO Now, Nicole LaPorte notes the service might one day include content not available on the standard network offering.

1838,Cantor's March Apple checks strong; over 1K Watch apps submitted,"Apr. 7, 2015, 10:58 AM","

Preliminary sales for Brian White's Apple Barometer (measures the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) are up 42%-44% M/M in March, better than 2014's 34% Apple Barometer growth and well above the 28% average seen over the last 10 years.
The Cantor analyst/Apple uber-bull now sees Apple Barometer sales dropping 25%-27% Q/Q in seasonally weak Q1; that compares with 32% a year ago and 25% two years ago. By contrast, the midpoint of Apple's calendar Q1 (FQ2) sales guidance calls for a 28% Q/Q revenue drop, worse than last year's 21%.
White reiterates a $180 target ahead of Apple's (AAPL -0.1%) April 27 FQ2 report. That's equal to nearly 16x his 2016 EPS estimate after backing out $24.07/share in net cash. Strong Apple supplier sales could also be a positive for Cirrus Logic (CRUS -0.1%), which has risen over 80% from its fall lows with the help of strong iPhone-related sales.
Meanwhile, in an employee memo, Tim Cook states ""more than one thousand [Apple Watch] apps were submitted in just four days last week when the App Store started accepting them, and the rate of submissions has only been climbing since then."" Apple released its WatchKit SDK last November; 3rd-party Watch apps currently have to interact with complementary iPhone/iPad apps.
Cook also states Apple employees - there were 72,800 as of last year - will get a 50% Watch discount. Pre-orders start on April 10, and shipments/in-store sales on April 24.

1839,"Citi adds Apple to Focus List, sees iPhone margins staying high","Apr. 1, 2015, 2:22 PM","

Nine months after launching coverage with a Buy rating, Citi's Jim Suva has added Apple (AAPL -0.2%) to his Focus List, while reiterating a $145 target.
Among Suva's 5 reasons why he thinks Apple can continue rising: He expects consumer demand for higher-capacity iPhones (driven by increased app usage and higher-resolution photos) to provide a ""permanent step up"" for gross margins. Demand for 64GB/128GB iPhone 6/6+ models helped Apple's GM rise 200 bps Y/Y in FQ1 to 39.9%, and its iPhone ASP jump to $687 from FQ4's $603.
RBC argued yesterday GMs could benefit from component discounts, as well as yield, mix, and pricing improvements. ""Going forward, we think that gross margins should act as the main lever for positive surprises...""
Also cited by Suva: 1) Faster consumer phone upgrades thanks to carrier promotions and upgrade plans. 2) Growing enterprise penetration as Apple steps up its efforts to court businesses. 3) The potential for Apple Pay/Passbook to strengthen the ecosystem through over a dozen potential uses (payments, identification, keyless entry, etc.). 4) An ""attractive"" valuation of 11x forward EPS exc. cash.
He sees Apple Watch as a ""bonus"" potential catalyst, and is cautious about its near-term sales due to concerns about its battery life and lack of built-in GPS (it relies on an iPhone to provide location data). Like others, Suva expects fresh dividend/buyback hikes to eventually arrive.

1840,Samsung gets rave reviews for Galaxy S6,"Apr. 1, 2015, 1:24 AM","

""The iPhone 6 (NASDAQ:AAPL) Has Met Its Match,"" reads the headline for the WSJ's review of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy S6.
Reviewer/iPhone 6 owner Joanna Stern: ""Like a child who just found out that Santa isn?™t real, I have spent the past week questioning everything I know."" She's a fan of the S6's glass/metal body with dual Gorilla Glass 4 (NYSE:GLW) panes, as well as its 2K OLED display, improved fingerprint sensor, rapid charging support, and 16MP OIS-capable camera. ""The Galaxy S6 destroys HTC?™s new One M9 and other flagship Android phones ... on photo quality.""

The Verge's Dieter Bohn gives the S6 8.8/10 stars. ""Samsung finally copied the right thing: caring about design."" Bohn declares the S6 to have ""one of the finest screens I have ever seen on a phone,"" thanks to a 577 PPI pixel density and improved color awareness. He also calls the device (powered by an 8-core Exynos CPU) ""probably the fastest Android phone I?™ve ever used.""

BGR's Zach Epstein: ""Samsung?™s Galaxy S6 features a stunning design that manages to be sleek and elegant, yet modern ... Samsung has raised the bar when it comes to smartphone screens ... Samsung finally stopped obsessing about increasing its [camera] megapixel counts and instead focused on improving its optics, design and software performance ... I?™ve never used a phone that charged from empty to full as quickly as this one.""
Samsung's software, though declared to be improved from the S5's (less bloatware, and what remains is often buried), still gets some criticism. Epstein reports seeing a lag with some UI features, and Stern is critical of Samsung's icons and keyboard. Also: Reviewers generally see little reason to pay an extra $100 for the curved S6 Edge, and some Android users might not like the S6's lack of a removable battery or microSD slot.
Ahead of the reviews, there have been reports Samsung has upped S6 production due to strong early interest. The phone goes on sale on April 10.
Other reviews: TechCrunch, CNET, Re/code, TechRadar

Expected S6 suppliers: BRCM, INVN, OLED, SYNA, MXIM, IDTI

""We believe ADI has secured multiple sockets across AAPL's iPhone/iPad lineup to enable the 3D/Force Touch feature,"" reports Barclays, upgrading Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) to Overweight and hiking its target by $15 to $70. ""[W]e believe AAPL needs and would be be willing to pay for ADI's high accuracy [analog/digital] converters.""

The WSJ reported 3 weeks ago Apple's next-gen iPhones will support haptic sensors that allow different software commands to be sent based on how hard a user presses on a screen. Apple has already integrated its haptics solution (christened Force Touch) within Apple Watch and a new 12"" retina MacBook.
Barclays forecasts the Apple wins will boost ADI's 2016 EPS by $0.80 or more. It thinks 1 converter chip will be needed for the iPhone and 3 for a 12"" iPad, and estimates an ASP of $1.50-$2.00. ""ADI is known to have the best converters in the industry and this level of performance is needed to compensate for high levels of screen noise.""
Long-term, the firm believes multi-chip iPad solutions could be replaced by a single chip, and that ADI could even ""integrate the 2D touch function into a single super chip."" It also believes the company is seeing strong industrial chip demand, forecasts a pickup in auto chip sales, and sees room for further revenue and cost synergies from the Hittite acquisition.

Though there have been a slew of reports stating Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will be the main supplier for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A9 CPU (expected to go into the iPhone 6S/6S+ and next-gen iPad Air), ""industry sources"" tell Taiwan's Digitimes TSMC (NYSE:TSM) will ""remain the major processor supplier for Apple in the second half of 2015.""
The world's biggest foundry will reportedly supply CPUs for the iPhone 6S and 6S+ using a next-gen 16nm FinFET process, and for a cheaper 4"" ""6C model"" via its existing 20nm process (used to make the A8). Cowen previously reported Apple is working on a new 4"" iPhone.
The site qualifies its report by stating Samsung is also expected to be a 6S/6S+ supplier. Samsung recently began producing chips using its next-gen 14nm FinFET process, widely expected to be leveraged for A9 production. Meanwhile, A8 orders have done wonders for TSMC: The company has posted 30%+ Y/Y sales growth for several months in a row.
In spite of a favorable Digitimes report last night as well (that one was about Q2 sales), shares fell 5.4% today amid a major chip stock rout - volume (32.3M shares) more than doubled a 3-month daily average of 13M.

A Cowen survey of 3K smartphone owners - 1K apiece in the U.S. and China, and 500 apiece in the U.K. and Japan - found nearly 20% of the 1,500 respondents who owned an iPhone 6/6+ (NASDAQ:AAPL) stating ""their new device replaced a competitor?™s smartphone, of which ~83% were Android."" Another 5% said the 6/6+ was their first smartphone.
Android defections were particularly strong in China, where 30% of 6/6+ owners said they replaced an Android phone - Apple's Greater China sales were up 70% Y/Y in calendar Q4. The figure was 14% in Japan, 9% in the U.K., and 8% in the U.S.
Also: 42% of the 1,500 respondents who plan to buy an iPhone 6/6+ in the next 12 months own a non-Apple smartphone, with 85% owning an Android device. Meanwhile, nearly 50% of those who have bought one upgraded early.
Regarding Apple Watch, the survey found 55% of respondents indicating ""a positive purchase intention,"" and 28% indicating neutral purchase intent. With 3/4 of respondents expecting battery life to be above 1 day (as compared with the official 18 hours under normal use), Cowen sees battery life as a near-term limitation. The firm has also reported initially supplies could be low.

IDC assigned the iPhone a 19.7% Q4 unit share to Android's 76.6%; revenue share is likely above 40%. More than a few observers have argued the arrival of 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones could win over some Android users who prefer larger-screened devices.

The 3G-only Lumia 430 is Microsoft's (MSFT +1.4%) cheapest Windows Phone to date. It has a 4"" 800x480 display and 8GB of storage, runs on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) low-end Snapdragon 200 processor (dual-core, 1.2GHz.), and contains a 2MP rear camera to go with a VGA front camera.
The 430, which goes on sale in April, also supports dual SIMs (important for emerging markets) and comes with up to 30GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its unveiling arrives three weeks after Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 640 and 640XL, and four months after it launched the low-end Lumia 535 (5"" display and 3G-only, starts at ??10).
Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4. While costlier Lumias have struggled to gain ground against the iPhone and high-end Android hardware (thanks in part to iOS/Android's app support edge), cheaper models have fared well in many cost-sensitive emerging markets. The 430 aims to significantly lower the cost edge the cheapest Android devices still have.

VentureBeat reports Intel's (INTC +3.7%) recently-announced XMM 7360 4G baseband modem (made by its Infineon unit) will go into 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, thus partly taking a slot reserved for several years by Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.9%) Gobi modems.
The site adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers ""have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone,"" and that Intel ""has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones."" Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm.
The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation. Qualcomm, which still claims the lion's share of the 4G baseband market, announced a Cat-10 LTE modem (the Gobi 9x45) last November that was declared to offer better power consumption and take up less board space than the prior-gen/Cat-6 9x35.
Apple sold 193M iPhones last year, and will likely top 200M this year. As is the case with many other clients, Qualcomm's modem sales to Apple help enable the sale of several complementary parts - an RF transceiver, a power management IC, a receive-only chip, and an envelope-tracking IC that lowers power draw.
Intel is up sharply today after selling off hard yesterday amid a market rout. The chip giant has already seen 18.2M shares traded vs.a 3-month daily average of 29M.

A day after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed off both a smartwatch and a 12"" retina MacBook featuring haptic Force Touch sensors that let users send different software commands based on how hard they press, the WSJ reports Apple plans to add the technology to its next-gen iPhones.
The paper also states the next-gen iPhones will have 4.7"" and 5.5"" displays (no surprise), and that Apple is testing a pink color option to go with its current silver, gold, and space grey options.
Apple demoed several Force Touch-related features for Mac OS apps at yesterday's event; Mail, Safari, and the Finder app were among the covered products. Messages, Music, and Calendar are among the Apple Watch apps with Force Touch controls; 3rd-party developers can also write apps supporting the technology.
Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) has licensed its haptic software and patents to many Android phone OEMs, and could strike more Android deals if the WSJ's report pans out. During its Q4 CC (transcript), when asked whether it plans to reach a licensing deal with or sue Apple, Immersion simply stated its guidance doesn't assume any Apple revenue or litigation expenses.
Meanwhile, a slew of hands-on reactions have been provided for Apple Watch from writers given a chance to test the device at Apple's event. The consensus: The Watch has plenty of interesting features and apps - here's a run-down of 3rd-party apps - but compared with the iPhone/iPad, its UI can be confusing to a new user.
Bloomberg's Stephen Pulvirent: ""On first use, the device felt a little confusing and clumsy. Sometimes it seemed to do one thing; at other times, just the opposite ... it seems like the interplay between tapping, swiping, and turning the crown will take some getting used to.""
The NYT's Farhad Manjoo: ""Whether it?™s calling an Uber car, checking into your hotel or answering a text, the watch will allow you to interact with the digital world at a glance, in a less outwardly antisocial way than you now do with your phone ... Should you really spend hundreds of dollars, let alone thousands, on a gadget to free you from the inconvenience of accessing your $650 smartphone?

On the thorny issue of HBO's cable/satellite partners who may object: ""We are talking to all of our partners,"" Plepler says, adding HBO thought ""it would be a great vehicle for them."" While Apple has a three-month exclusive for its devices, program providers could get into that window via their existing relationship with HBO. Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) and Cox Communications were known to be in discussions with HBO already about providing the service. Cox is mum so far on how/if it will make HBO Now available to broadband-only customers. Apple makes a pretty good partner for a content company that has no experience with direct customer service; meanwhile, Apple has a massive payments infrastructure and 400M credit cards already set up. NPD analyst John Buffone tells Tom's Guide that Apple TV is No. 1 in their last streaming device report, ahead of Roku, Chromecast and Fire TV. It's used by 25M. No exclusive window comes without money changing hands; while financial terms are undisclosed, it's possible there's a middle ground between the 30% cut that Apple takes in apps and the 50-50 split HBO has with some existing program partners.

Apple's (AAPL +1.5%) long-rumored 12"" retina MacBook has been unveiled - it's declared to be the thinnest and lightest MacBook Apple has ever made, as well as the first fanless MacBook. It's 13.1mm thin, and weighs just 2 pounds. For reference, the current 11"" and 13"" MacBook Airs respectively weigh 2.38 and 2.96 pounds.
The 12"" MacBook has an all-metal enclosure, a new keyboard that's thinner and provides more precise/accurate keystrokes, and a clickless ""Force Touch"" trackpad with haptic force sensors (enables pressure-sensitive ""Force Clicks""). Engadget wonders if Synaptics' (SYNA) ForcePad tech is being used. Immersion (IMMR +5%) has spiked higher, perhaps on hopes Apple rivals will adopt its haptic tech.
Some specs: A 2304x1440 display that consumes 30% less power than prior displays; a 14nm Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M CPU (cores clocked up to 1.3GHz., rising to 2.9GHz. with Turbo Boost); 9 hours of battery life for wireless Web browsing; a single USB-C (reversible) connector that can serve as a data, power, or video-out (HDMI/VGA) connector.
The 12"" MacBook begins shipping on April 10, and will be offered via $1299  and $1599 models; the costlier model has a faster CPU and twice the  storage.
Also: 1) Apple has updated the 13"" MacBook Pro, providing it with faster CPUs, and flash memory, improved battery life, and the Force Touch trackpad. The MacBook Air line has also received CPU and flash upgrades. 2) Apple has unveiled ResearchKit, an open-source software framework for medical researchers that enables diagnostics iPhone apps.

Tim Cook states at Apple's (AAPL +1%) San Francisco event the price of the current Apple TV set-top (now 3 years old) has been cut by $30 to $69. That makes it more competitive with Roku's hardware ($50-$100) and Google's Chromecast ($35, requires another device to stream content). A new Apple TV set-top is rumored to be in the pipeline.
HBO (TWX +0.8%) CEO Richard Plepler announces Apple will be the exclusive launch partner for the standalone HBO Now streaming service (previous). He also confirms the service will be priced at $15/month.
Some shared stats: 700M iPhones and 25M Apple TVs have been cumulatively sold, and Apple Pay is now supported at 700K locations; 100K Coca-Cola vending machines will support it by year's end. All major auto manufacturers now support CarPlay.

 While HBO (NYSE:TWX) is in high-profile talks with Apple to launch its streaming HBO Now service on Apple TV, other providers will be joining in at some point or even at launch day yet, including Google and TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) among others. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be first to agree to the launch, Bloomberg notes, because its negotiation is simpler than that with HBO's longtime pay TV partners. Cox Communications and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) are also linked to discussions, though traditional cable/satellite providers are a tougher sell, accustomed as they are to the traditional arrangement (and income stream). It's safe to assume all the partners marketing HBO's current HBO Go offering are likely to engage in some level of talks with TWX to offer HBO Now -- including Roku, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Cable repercussions? Several pay TV operators had started lowering their price for HBO via promotions, a possible move to brace for HBO Now's direct launch: Comcast lowered its monthly HBO rate from $18.95 to $15, or $10 if you order online. Verizon's offering HBO for $9.99/month for first 12; Time Warner Cable is offering $9.99/month for online orders; Cox is offering $10/month for the first six. As for HBO Go -- the current service that allows mobile viewing for authenticated existing HBO customers -- it appears it will continue to exist as is for now, despite the likelihood of product confusion. HBO's targeting 10M broadband subscribers who don't have cable or satellite -- at this $15 price point, it makes a huge competitive interface with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  ",,,
1859,"Report: Apple music service to undercut Spotify, new Apple TV planned","Mar. 5, 2015, 5:40 PM","


9to5 Mac reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to launch a music subscription service relying on technology provided by Beats Music at its WWDC conference (expected to run from June 8-12). It adds the service will be ""priced as high as $7.99 per month,"" thereby undercutting the existing Beats Music service ($10/month or $100/year), as well as Spotify ($10/month + $5 per extra family member) and other existing services.
The service will be built into the iOS Music app, and will also be offered through a standalone Android app (the first to be built by Apple internally). Re/code has already reported Apple is trying to get studios to agree to a price cut. The WSJ reported in October Apple plans to merge the Beats Music service with iTunes.
The rumored launch effort comes as standard music download sales continue declining. Tim Cook praised Beats Music (relies on both an algorithm and human curation) last May. ""We love the subscription service that they built?”we think it's the first one that really got it right.""
9to5 also reports Apple is ""finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store."" Though Apple once wanted to launch the box as soon as this month - the current-gen Apple TV is three years old - challenges in nailing down content deals ""could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future.""
Bloomberg reported last year Apple was working on deals to support pay-TV content from Time Warner Cable and others through a new Apple TV. More recently, Re/code reported Apple is hatching plans to offer a Web TV service.

The larger iPad is expected to be aimed at enterprises and creative pros - there have been rumors of a stylus accessory for it - and bolster a business sales push that already includes partnerships with IBM and various indie developers to create enterprise-focused iOS apps. On Monday, IBM launched new iOS apps aimed at banking/financial services, retail, and travel/transportation clients.
While iPhone and Mac sales have been growing, the iPad has been a weak spot for Apple lately: iPad sales have been down Y/Y during the last four quarters, and fell 22% in FQ1 (the December quarter).

 HBO (NYSE:TWX) is reportedly talking with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a launch partner for its streaming service -- to be called ""HBO Now"" and rolling out next month. The service is working with MLB Advanced Media to produce the standalone service in time for the fifth season premiere of Game of Thrones. The price is expected to be about $15/month. For Apple's part, it would mean a chance to add a high-quality offering to push adoption of Apple TV. The availability of a standalone service from HBO -- often a $15-$20/month add-on and a marquee offering in cable/satellite packages -- should send ripples throughout the pay TV industry. One study says the service alone would cause a 7% drop in subscribers overall. Some providers -- who count on Internet customers as well -- may bundle it with broadband offerings in order to reach cord-cutters, however.

As rumored, Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy S6 eschews the plastic-heavy designs of its predecessors in favor a body with a metal frame and both front and back glass panels - both panels use Corning's (NYSE:GLW) recently-launched Gorilla Glass 4 (offers better damage resistance).
Also as expected: The standard S6 is accompanied by the S6 Edge, a premium model with curved sides. Samsung has also launched a new version of its Gear VR headset (relies on Oculus' VR platform) that uses the S6/S6 Edge for its display instead of the Note 4.
The S6's display size is unchanged from the S5's 5.1"", but (as was the case for the Note 4) the resolution has been upgraded from 1080p to 2560x1440 - that's a positive for OLED materials supplier Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED). An 8-core Samsung Exynos processor powers international S6 models - Qualcomm Snapdragon processors have historically powered U.S. models, but that might not be the case this time.
A new fingerprint sensor (previous) only requires users to touch the home button (a la Apple's TouchID) rather than swipe over it, as is the case with the S5's sensor. Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) should receive an ASP boost, provided it remains Samsung's fingerprint sensor supplier and not rival FPC.
Other features: Wireless charging support; a 16MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, improved software, and an F/1.9 aperture (good for low-light shots); a 5MP front camera that also has an F/1.9 aperture, 32/64/128GB storage tiers (up from 16/32/64GB); and far less bloatware - Samsung claims the S6 has 40% fewer software features than the S5.
Initial reactions are positive. ""Samsung finally builds a premium smartphone,"" proclaims Ars Technica. The Verge calls the S6/S6 Edge ""dramatically nicer and better phones than Samsung has ever produced."" More than a few observers have spotted major design similarities with the iPhone 6 (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The phones go on sale on April 10. Samsung needs a hit: It's coming off a Q4 where its smartphone unit share fell to 20% from 28.8% a year earlier (per IDC) amid stiff competition from Apple and Chinese Android OEMs.

As of 2012, Cisco (CSCO -0.9%) had 60 products on a Chinese government list of products approved for purchase by state entities. As of late 2014, it had none, according to Reuters' analysis of government data.
PC/server virtualization software vendor Citrix (CTXS +0.5%) has also seen its products disappear from the list, as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) McAfee security software unit. While the total number of products on the list has risen by over 2K since 2012 (to nearly 5K), the number of approved foreign tech brands has fallen by a third.
The data highlights the ripple effects of the 2013 NSA spying uproar, as well as China's broader interest in promoting local tech firms relative to foreign suppliers. Bloomberg reported in December the Chinese government is ""aiming to purge most foreign technology from banks, the military, state-owned enterprises and key government agencies by 2020.""
Cisco's Chinese sales have already been under heavy pressure for several quarters. Thanks in part to the government's efforts, the networking giant's Chinese orders fell 19% Y/Y in the January quarter, compared with just a 1% drop for other Asia-Pac markets.

Hough notes Apple (AAPL +2%), unlike most tech peers, reports EPS on a GAAP basis, which (by including stock compensation and other expenses) serves to deflate the figure. He also highlights Apple's negative cash-conversion cycle - it's paid by customer for products before it pays suppliers - which is a big reason why its FY15 free cash flow/share consensus ($10.17) is well above its EPS consensus ($8.53).
At $160, Apple would trade at 17x forward EPS, on par with the S&P 500's current valuation. Hough: ""Considering Apple?™s understated earnings, its cash hoard, its avenues for growth, and its history of beating expectations, it?™s time for the stock to carry at least a market valuation, if not a premium.""

Four months after setting a $203 Apple (AAPL +2.1%) target in an open letter, Carl Icahn has upped his target to a lofty $216 in a new letter.

Notably, Icahn's EPS estimate is based on a 20% ""real cash earnings"" tax rate, rather than the 26.2% ""effective"" tax rate used by Apple, which recognizes taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. He declares his estimate is only $0.39 above consensus if the tax rate difference is accounted for.

Past remarks from Apple execs have suggested both a strong dislike of the current TV-viewing experience, and an interest in improving it if the industry is willing to play ball. Reports last year stated Apple has talked with Time Warner Cable and others about supporting pay-TV content on a new Apple TV set-top.

Apple (AAPL +1.2%) plans to spend $2B to turn what used to be GT Advanced's (OTCPK:GTATQ -1.4%) sapphire manufacturing plant (located in Mesa, AZ) into a data center that will serve as a ""command center"" for its global data center infrastructure.
The 1.3M+ sq. foot plant will employ 150 full-time Apple workers, create 300-500 construction/trade jobs, and be powered by renewable energy. While GT owned the furnaces installed within the facility - they're now being sold to pay off GT's debt to Apple, as part of its Chap. 11 restructuring - Apple controls the facility itself.
Apple has been on a data center building spree over the last several years. The company has set a $13B FY15 (ends Sep. '15) capex budget, up from FY14's $11B and equal to nearly 6% of its FY15 revenue consensus.

In 2008, Apple and Ericsson struck a licensing deal covering many of the patents now under dispute. A WSJ source says that agreement will expire shortly.
Ericsson has responded to Apple's suit filing a complaint against the company with a U.S. district court, stating Apple's existing license had expired and that two years of negotiations have failed. Ericsson wants the court's help to determine if its offer is fair.

With Apple having disclosed Watch pricing will start at $349 - the stainless steel version has been rumored to start at $500 - cost was cited as the most common reason for a lack of interest. 60.1% of those who said they'd be willing to pay for one put their maximum purchase price at ""less than $200."" 25.7% would be willing to pay $200-$299, and 8.6% $300-$399. Roughly half of survey respondents regularly wear a watch.

Two things Legere has kind words for (besides T-Mobile): 1) Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), which he predicts will ""mark the tipping point when wearables go from niche to mainstream."" 2) Phablets, which he expects will see 50% sales growth next year and thereby boost data usage.
One positive prediction for the industry in general: Legere forecasts 2/3 of devices sold next year by carriers will be subsidy-free, up from 41% in 2014. The margin improvement that has come from moving customers from subsidies to early-upgrade and installment plans has been a silver lining for the industry during its price war.

1906,Flurry: Apple made up 51% of tracked Christmas activations,"Dec. 30, 2014, 9:54 AM","

Apple (AAPL -0.4%) hardware accounted for 51.3% of the Christmas mobile device activations tracked by leading app analytics firm Flurry, according to data pulled from 600K+ apps. #2 Samsung accounted for 17.7%, and #3 Nokia (Microsoft) 5.8%.
One caveat: The U.S., where the iPhone and the iPad claim outsized smartphone and tablet shares, accounts for a large percentage of both Christmas phone/tablet gifting and Flurry's app tracking. Thus, China's Xiaomi, Huawei, and Lenovo, each of whom had ~5% Q3 global smartphone unit shares (per Gartner), had sub-1% device activation shares.
Nonetheless, with Kantar respectively pegging the iPhone's U.S. and EU5 shares for the August-October period at 41.5% and 20.7%, the data points to strong holiday iPhone 6 demand in the U.S. and Europe. Flurry: ""While, the holidays in general and Christmas in particular are not the sole indicator of the smartphone market share and trends, it is safe to say that Apple?™s newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have had a blockbuster holiday season.""

Cowen's Tim Arcuri reports Apple (AAPL -0.2%) is working on a new 4"" iPhone that could launch in 2015, along with larger models. Sources add the 4"" device's specs could resemble the iPhone 5S', albeit with a revamped design.
Arcuri's report follows a similar one from Taiwan's Electronic Times, which (citing supply chain sources) stated Apple plans to launch a new 4"" iPhone in 2H15.
Though still offering the 5S and 5C, Apple refrained from launching a new 4"" iPhone this fall to go with the 4.7"" iPhone 6 and 5.5"" 6 Plus. The smaller form factor still has its share of loyalists, and arguably has contributed heavily to the iPhone's success in Japan (Apple's strongest major market in terms of smartphone share).
Depending on their pricing, new 4"" iPhones could also help Apple better compete against mid-range Android phones without heavily cannibalizing sales of high-end 4.7"" and 5.5"" models.

1908,Morgan Stanley upbeat about Q4 iPhone sales; BBC probes labor practices,"Dec. 19, 2014, 10:47 AM","

Morgan Stanley, whose internal iPhone (AAPL +0.1%) sales tracker has often (though not always) been more accurate than consensus estimates, says its tracker points to 67M calendar Q4 (FQ1) iPhone sales, above a 63M consensus.
Analyst Katy Huberty (recently hiked her target to $126) notes demand is especially strong in China (nearly 3x global Y/Y growth rates), where plenty of signs point to strong pent-up interest in larger iPhones. U.S. demand is said to be in-line with global trends, and Japan and France ""somewhat below.""
Huberty adds strong demand could require Apple to fill its channel inventory, particularly given its plans to grow channel inventory target range by a week to 5-7 weeks. A two-week replenish could result in another 7M iPhone sales.
Meanwhile, a BBC undercover probe into the labor practices of Apple contract manufacturer Pegatron is garnering attention. BBC states it ""found standards on workers' hours, ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached,"" and that one undercover reporter ""had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off.""
BBC also says it found evidence tin from Indonesian mines using child labor ""could be entering [Apple's] supply chain."" In an e-mail to U.K. workers, Tim Cook is said to be ""deeply offended"" by the allegations. This is far from the first time labor practices at Chinese contract manufacturers have come under fire.

An Oakland jury has unanimously ruled Apple (AAPL - unchanged) is not guilty of violating antitrust laws by launching iTunes updates that once prevented iPods from playing DRM-secured content from non-iTunes sources.
Class-action plaintiffs were seeking $350M in damages. In theory, antitrust laws could've put Apple on the hook for more than $1B in the event of a guilty verdict.
Apple argued during the trial the iTunes updates in question delivered meaningful improvements, and that its DRM policies were needed both for security reasons, and to honor commitments with music labels. The company axed its FairPlay DRM system (at the heart of the antitrust complaint) for purchased music in 2009.

1912,UBS hikes FQ1 iPhone forecast following Google checks,"Dec. 5, 2014, 5:54 PM","

UBS' Evidence Lab Phone Monitor, which attempts to gauge iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) demand based on Google search activity, forecasts 70.9M iPhone sales for FQ1 (calendar Q4), well above a 64M consensus.
That, in turn, has led analyst Steve Milunovich to hike his sales target by 4M to 67M. He thinks supply constraints will lead sales to be lower than the Phone Monitor's estimate.
Discussing reports of FQ2 iPhone 6 production cuts, Milunovich says UBS' checks don't point to major changes. Nonetheless, he expects production to fall 40% Q/Q in the seasonally weaker quarter, albeit with a mix shift towards the higher-ASP 6 Plus thanks to FQ1 supply constraints and strong Asian demand (previous).
Milunovich has a decent track record (I, II) when it comes to Apple checks. His remarks come two days after JMP reported seeing strong iPhone sales in the U.S. and China, and power amplifier supplier Avago said it expects sales to ""a large North American smartphone OEM"" (odds are it's not BlackBerry) to remain strong in Q1.

1913,"Apple lower following cautious Pac Crest, Deutsche notes","Dec. 2, 2014, 9:53 AM","

Pac Crest, which downgraded Apple (AAPL -1.1%) to Sector Perform following its Sep. 9 iPhone event, believes calendar Q4 (FQ1) will likely represent a peak for iPhone growth. The firm argues current growth is largely being driven by the existing iPhone base rather than new users, and that demand has been pulled in from future quarters.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Taiwan tech analyst Yasuo Nakane has raised his calendar Q4 iPhone 6/6 Plus production forecast by 2M units to 68M, but slashed his forecast for seasonally weak Q1 to 35M-38M units from 49M, citing soft production of 5.5"" LCD panels.
Nakane still expects 6 Plus sales to be better than expected prior to its launch, but adds iPhone ""production adjustments in 1Q 2015 like those seen last year and two years ago would suggest that demand is not as strong as the buzz in the market and the media portray it and that the consensus is overly optimistic.""
Fiksu's tracking data currently shows the iPhone 6's base being 2.7x as large as the 6 Plus' base. That ratio has narrowed from the ~4x seen in early October, when the 6 Plus was very supply-constrained. Altogether, the 6 and 6 Plus are estimated to respectively account for 11.8% and 4.4% of the total iPhone base; the 5S was at 8.1% at a similar point in time.
Cirrus Logic (CRUS -2.5%), which received 73% of its calendar Q3 sales from Apple, is also lower.

Apple is upping its target range to 5-7 weeks, but doesn't expect to reach it in FQ1. (live blogs: BI, WSJ) As expected, a mix shift towards the iPhone 6 and the costlier/supply-constrained 6 Plus is boosting iPhone ASPs. ""We're selling everything that we make,"" Tim Cook interjected during a question about product mix. iPad channel inventory fell by 500K during FQ4. In spite of the 14% Y/Y drop in iPad revenue, Cook dismisses suggestions the market is saturated, noting over half of sales still go to first-time buyers. He did, however, admit consumers hold onto iPads (less likely to be sold with subsidies/installment plans) longer than they hold onto iPhones. CFO Luca Maestri Maestri noted Apple, like many other U.S. companies, is dealing with forex headwinds caused by a strong dollar. He added forex is factored into FQ1 guidance. Other details: 1) Apple bought 7 more companies in FQ4 (only 4 are known), bringing the FY14 total to 20. 2) App Store revenue rose 36% Y/Y. 3) Cook asserts Mac market share (previous) is at its highest level since 1995. FQ4 Mac revenue was 25% above iPad revenue. 4) Apple expects to open 25 new stores in FY15, ~75% of which will be outside the U.S.

Spotify is now offering family discounts: While the first family member signing up for its premium service pays the standard $10/month, each additional member pays only $5/month. ""This is one of the most asked for features from our audience,"" says content chief Ken Parks.
Meanwhile, Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been pushing music labels to agree to price cuts that would allow it to sell an overhauled Beats Music streaming service (previous) for just $5/month. However, the site suspects Apple doesn't think the labels will give in, and considers an $8/month rate a more realistic goal.
Pandora (P -1.9%) is lower on an up day for tech. Thus far, the company has done a decent job of staving off threats from subscription-based streaming services.

Not surprisingly, the iPad Air 2's (AAPL -0.9%) pricing starts at $499 (16GB Wi-Fi). As with the iPhone 6, Apple has doubled storage capacities for higher-tier models; 64GB and 128GB Wi-Fi-only models respectively go for $599 and $699. The original Air now starts at $399.

Very little time was spent discussing the iPad Mini 3. Moreover, while the Air 2 features (like the iPhone 6) 802.11ac Wi-Fi and an 8MP rear camera, the Mini 3 offers 802.11n Wi-Fi and a 5MP camera.
The Mini 3's pricing starts at $399, as expected. The Mini 2 (also has a retina display) now starts at $299, and (notably) the original, non-retina Mini is being kept around with a $249 starting price. The price points for the older models could help Apple grab some mid-range share from Android rivals.
A 27"" retina iMac featuring an eye-popping 5210x2880 resolution (67% more pixels than 4K) has been shown off. ""It's the world's highest-resolution display,"" declares VP Phil Schiller. The system is still only 5mm thick at its edges, and its display consumes 30% less power than its predecessor's.
Retina iMac models run on quad-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 and i7 CPUs (3.5GHz.-4GHz.), and starts at $2,499. AMD (AMD +1.3%) is supplying a high-end Radeon R9 GPU. The 27"" non-retina iMac will start at $1,799, and its 21.5"" peer $1,099.
Apple is counting on its new iPads to spark a sales rebound: iPad revenue fell 8% Y/Y in calendar Q2 amid extended upgrade cycles and share gains for low-end Android tablets.
Analyst/Apple fan Ben Thompson recently argued the iPad has been hurt by softening developer support relative to the iPhone, along with the popularity of bigger phones and thinner/lighter PCs (such as the MacBook Air).

The iPad Air 2 (AAPL -0.6%) is only 6.1mm thick - 18% thinner than the original Air and 12% thinner than the iPhone 6. Official battery life is still at 10 hours.
As expected, Apple has added a Touch ID fingerprint sensor (supports Apple Pay), and an anti-reflective coating that reduces glare - Apple claims the lowest reflectivity of any tablet. The device runs on an A8X CPU said to respectively deliver 40% and 150% CPU and GPU performance improvements over the Air's A7 processor.
The Air 2 sports an 8MP rear camera, improved from the Air's 5MP camera. Slo-mo video (120 fps) and burst mode support has been added. The front camera has been updated to include a faster aperture and single-shot HDR support.

A hearing over GT Advanced's (GTAT) request to shut down its sapphire manufacturing ops and keep many details about its Chap. 11 filing sealed that was originally set for today has been pushed back to Oct. 21, the day after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ4 report.
GT, Apple, and a committee of creditors agreed to the push-out. Also delayed: A ruling on Apple's objections to GT's attempt to free itself of certain contracts and leases.
Nonetheless, the day wasn't without fresh drama. Bankruptcy judge Henry Boroff grilled Apple over its extensive secrecy requests, questioning how much proprietary info was actually included in many of the docs it wants kept private. ""I've got a foot-high stack of documents, and it can't be that it all must be sealed.""
Boroff also provided a colorful analogy for the dispute between Apple and its would-be supplier. ""I?™m seeing what looks incredibly like a construction suit, where a homeowner says to the contractor, 'It didn't come out the way I wanted to,' and the contractor says, 'Well, it would have come out that way if you didn't continue to change the specifications.'""

 Believing the iPhone 6 Plus and higher-capacity iPhone 6 models will drive margin and ASP growth, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty has added Apple (AAPL -0.4%) to her Best Ideas list ahead of the tech giant's Monday FQ4 report. Huberty, already quite bullish on Apple, notes many sources suggest a large number of consumers are opting for 64GB iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (unsubsidized U.S. prices of $749 and $849) over cheaper 16GB models. While Apple charges $100 extra for the former, its incremental flash memory cost is a fraction of that figure. Likewise, she sees healthy demand for the 6 Plus (apparently quite popular in China), whose incremental manufacturing cost is believed to be a fraction of its $100 premium relative to comparable iPhone 6 models.
Nonetheless, Huberty's forecast for FQ4 iPhone unit sales is relatively subdued: Citing her firm's Web search sell-through data (often, though not always, accurate), she expects 37M sales, generally in-line with consensus.

QQ.com previously reported iPhone 6 pre-registrations (not the same as an actual order) had hit 4M as of Oct. 3. Those numbers also pointed to strong interest in the 6 Plus, which Apple is reportedly boosting production of.
For reference, Stifel recently forecast Apple would sell 65.3M iPhones globally in FQ1 (the December quarter). Chinese iPhone 6 sales start on Oct. 17, and FQ4 results are due on Oct. 20.

In a test involving thousands of queries on various subjects, Stone Temple Consulting found Google Now (NASDAQ:GOOG) managed to ""completely answer"" a question 88% of the time, a rate well above the 53% posted by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri and the 40% delivered by Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana.
In addition, Now showed ""enhanced results"" (results featuring some kind of knowledge box/panel or structured data) 58% of the time; Siri did so 29% of the time, and Cortana 20%.
Stone Temple was also impressed with Now's ability to return complementary data and detailed results: A query of ""Burj Khalifa height"" returned (in addition to the skyscraper's height) the heights of various other buildings, and a query of ""becoming a firefighter"" returned step-by-step instructions from FireScience.org.
Now, which comes built into Google's version of Android and is available on iOS through the (well-downloaded) Google search app, both strengthens Google's mobile search position, and (to the extent the search app is used instead of Mobile Safari on iOS) lowers the company's search traffic acquisition payments to Apple.

""GT believes that it has many claims against Apple arising out of its business relationship with Apple (AAPL - unchanged),"" reads a GT Advanced (GTAT -38.7%) bankruptcy court filing.
The company has confirmed it's closing down the Mesa, AZ plant where it has been producing sapphire for Apple, and cutting 890 related jobs. GT claims it's losing $1M/day at the operations it plans to close. A hearing on GT's motion for permission to close the plant is set for Oct. 15.
GT's decision suggests Apple will have to turn to third parties to obtain the sapphire needed for the two Apple Watch models featuring sapphire cover glass. A recent Taiwanese media report stated Apple was aiming to launch the Apple Watch in February, and that supplies are constrained by sapphire output.
The apparent threat to sue comes as crucial details about GT's bankruptcy filing remain sealed due to a confidentially agreement (almost certainly with Apple) said to carry a penalty of $50M per violation.

While Carl Icahn pounds the table for Apple (AAPL +1%) and Apple buybacks once more, Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz has upgraded shares to Outperform, and set a $115 target.
Uerkwitz: ""We believe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined will be the best selling iPhone generation to-date as iOS 8 and larger displays draw much broader consumer appeal than before."" He expects new iPhone 6/iOS 8 features such as Apple Pay, HealthKit, HomeKit, and deeper iOS/Mac OS integration boosting ""user stickiness.""
The upgrade follows a bullish coverage launch from BofA/Merrill, and a Deutsche downgrade.
Meanwhile, the WSJ reports strong iPhone 6 demand has caused Apple suppliers to push back mass-production of a 12.9"" iPad to early 2015 from December. ""The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,"" says one source. Digitimes recently reported Apple was shifting production from the standard iPhone 6 to the higher-ASP, supply-constrained 6 Plus.
Icahn's $203/share Apple target assumes a valuation of 19x FY15E EPS exc. net cash. He respectively forecasts 44%, 30%, and 30% earnings growth and 25%, 21%, and 21% revenue growth for the next 3 years (well above consensus estimates) on the back of ""significant"" high-end smartphone share gains.
Notably, Icahn thinks Apple can sell 72.5M watches in FY17 at a steep ASP of $450. He also says (albeit while cautioning it might never happen)  he has ""good enough reason to expect"" Apple will release a 4K TV set in FY16, and predicts 25M units will be sold in FY17 at a $1,500 ASP.

Gartner estimates shipments fell only 0.5%. Developed markets continue faring better than emerging markets still getting hit by tablet cannibalization. IDC thinks U.S. shipments rose 4.3%, a bit slower than Q2's 6.9% growth. EMEA grew, while Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) declined. Japanese growth remained ""deeply negative."" The corporate migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 (following MSFT's ending of XP support) is still providing a lift, as is a soft tablet market. However, IDC cautions demand for ""large commercial refreshes"" remains low. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally managed to crack IDC's list of the top-5 global vendors: With the help of a strong U.S. market and Mac price cuts, Apple's unit share rose an estimated 60 bps to 6.3%. Revenue share is likely above 10%, given Apple's calendar Q2 Mac ASP was $1,255. U.S. unit share was at 13%. The four companies ahead of Apple all grew their shares as well, gaining ground against vendors with less scale: Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) was at 20% (+230 bps), H-P (NYSE:HPQ) at 18.8% (+130 bps), Dell at 13.3% (+140 bps), and Acer (OTC:ACEIY) at 8.4% (+100 bps).

WantChinaTimes reports China Mobile, Unicom, and Telecom recorded 1M+ iPhone 6/6 Plus pre-registrations within 6 hours. For reference, China Mobile had 1.2M iPhone pre-registrations from Christmas to January 13, after making the device officially available for the first time.
Apple (AAPL -0.4%) will start taking Chinese iPhone 6 pre-orders on Oct. 10, ahead of the Oct. 17 start of in-store sales. With over 40% of Chinese smartphone buyers estimated to be opting for 5""+ phones, pent-up demand for larger iPhones is likely considerable. At the same time, Chinese carriers have been slashing high-end phone subsidies following government pressure.
A Taiwanese media report states Apple is looking to launch the Apple Watch (officially due in ""early 2015"") in February, and that supplies are constrained by sapphire output.
That follows a report from Hong Kong's Apple Daily that Quanta will start Apple Watch mass-production in January, and one from The Information suggesting the watch might not ship before Valentine's Day. The standard Apple Watch and high-end Apple Watch Edition (has an 18-karat gold case) use sapphire, while the Apple Watch Sport doesn't.

Bank Innovation reports iOS 8.1 is set to arrive on Oct. 20, and will include Apple Pay support. Apple has already lined up card issuers possessing 83% of the U.S. market, and retail partners (inc. McDonald's, Whole Foods, and Walgreens) with 220K stores between them.

Rakers adds a stronger mix of iPhone 6/6 Plus sales could yield upside to his forecasts. He thinks the 6/6Plus could account for 60-70% of FQ1 iPhone sales, leading iPhone ASP to rise to $680 or higher. ASP was only at $561 in FQ3, and $596 in FQ2.
The iPhone 6 carries unsubsidized U.S. prices of $649-$849, and the 6 Plus prices of $749-$949. Rakers notes Apple's decision to double the storage capacities of higher-capacity models could also provide an ASP lift.
BMO's Keith Bachman (Outperform) has upped his FY15 (ends Sep. '15) iPhone sales estimate by 10.6M units to 189M.

Tim Cook praised Beats Music shortly after the Apple-Beats deal was announced, declaring the streaming music service to be ""the first one that really got it right."" However, as TechCrunch observes, having a Beats-branded service run in parallel with iTunes-branded services runs counter to ""Apple?™s penchant for simple, unified brands.""

First weekend sales results for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could disappoint, Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi warns, noting AAPL's pre-order announcement and customer expected delivery dates point to stronger supply constraints vs. prior years and China's absence as a launch country.
Sacconaghi estimates first weekend shipments could come in at 7M-8M units rather than expectations for as high as 10M units or even the 9M iPhone 5S and 5Cs shipped last year.
But the analyst says investors should bear in mind that ""first weekend sales"" are principally a function of available supply rather than iPhone demand; a slower ramp could ultimately prove beneficial for AAPL, since a later China rollout could push sales forward and help smooth the iPhone's typical March quarter falloff.

Apple's (AAPL +0.5%) smartwatch will join the iPhone 6 in sporting an NFC radio that will enable a tap-to-pay payments solution, the WSJ reports.?Given recent reports, NXP (NXPI +0.5%) is the likely chip supplier.
The WSJ also backs up the Nikkei in stating the watch will feature a curved OLED display - a moderate positive for Universal Display (OLED +6.8%) - and reiterates two sizes will be offered.
At the same time, Apple is said to be ""still working out engineering kinks in production,"" and one source says there's ""no way"" the watch ships this year (meshes with a re/code report). Pre-orders will be taken in advance.
No word on pricing; re/code has reported Apple has mulled a $400 price point. Unsurprisingly, Jony Ive is said to have overseen development. Ive has reportedly boasted Apple's watch spells trouble for Switzerland.
Meanwhile, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo reports the watch will have 8GB of storage, and that the display sizes will respectively be 1.3"" and 1.5"". Kuo reported of NFC support back in April, and of limited 2014 production in July.

Six months after upgrading Apple (AAPL -3%) to Outperform on iPhone 6 hopes, Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves recommends investors start taking profits.
Though keeping his rating for now, Hargreaves says a downgrade could arrive if Apple's Sep. 9 event doesn't reveal products/services that ""suggest massive incremental profit opportunities."" He doubts Apple's rumored wearable and payments platform will ""drive incremental profits that are meaningful at Apple's scale in the near to medium term,"" and is hoping some ""clarifying detail"" will be given at the event.
Other Apple-related news: 1) A Chinese site indicates China Mobile has already begun taking iPhone 6 reservations. 2) Apple is reportedly talking with Nordstrom about supporting its payments platform. 3) The fallout from a weekend iCloud celebrity photo-theft scandal continues. Apple, for its part, denies iCloud was breached, but doesn't deny photos were taken through the service. 4) Ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, Samsung has unveiled its Note 4 and Edge phablets; the latter features a display that curves at the edges.

Following reports Apple (AAPL +0.8%) is working on a mobile payments platform leveraging NFC radios, Touch ID fingerprint sensors, and 800M+ iTunes accounts, Stifel thinks Apple may have finally ""cracked the code"" for getting consumers to make offline payments with their phones rather than credit/debit cards.
Stifel: ""With NFC and iBeacon to follow, we expect Apple?™s payments product to be more focused on physical, brick-and-mortar retail than online ... We think Apple correctly sees a much bigger opportunity offline where consumer adoption is still negligible.""
RBC sees a chance to create a loyalty points system for Apple products/services. Forbes' Mark Rogowsky thinks tech advances, Apple's scale, and the pending U.S. adoption of chip-and-PIN readers (will increase NFC reader support and make card payments slightly less convenient) amount to ""a perfect storm"" that can allow Apple's platform to succeed in spite of the failures of existing NFC solutions (Isis, Google Wallet, etc.).
PayPal owner eBay (EBAY -0.9%) is off moderately. PayPal has made a number of moves to expand into offline payments, but uptake has been limited. It handled $27B in mobile transactions last year, largely for online payments. Unlike Apple's solution (from all indications), PayPal's mobile payments offerings support both Android and iOS.

David Einhorn took some Apple (AAPL -0.4%) profits in Q2: Greenlight Capital owned 9.4M Apple shares at the end of June, down from a split-adjusted 14M at the end of March.
On the other hand, Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors bought 1.3M shares during the quarter; Cooperman had bailed out of Apple in Q3 of last year. Adjusted for the split, Carl Icahn's position is roughly steady at 52.8M shares.

IDC estimates the iPhone accounted for 11.7% of Q2 smartphone units, down from 13% a year ago. Android's (NASDAQ:GOOG) share rose to 84.7% from 79.6%, and industry shipments grew an estimated 25.3% (down slightly from Q1's 28.6%) to 301.3M.
At the same time, IDC notes over 80% of iPhone shipments ($561 Q2 ASP) involved a $400+ unsubsidized price, with the remainder in the $200-$400 range. Nearly 60% of Android shipments involved sub-$200 phones, with the remainder split almost evenly between $200-$400 and $400+ devices.
Following government pressure, China Mobile has cut its 2014 phone subsidy budget to $3.4B from a prior $5.5B. With the carrier having spent $2.5B on subsidies in 1H14, its fall iPhone 6 subsidies will likely be light.

The news service adds the next-gen Air will have an anti-reflective coating, and that there have been ""manufacturing complications"" related to it. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo has reported the next-gen Air and Mini will have an A8 CPU and fingerprint sensor, and that the former will get an 8MP rear camera (improved from the current 5MP).

IDC estimates global tablet shipments rose 11% in Q2, with Apple's unit share falling to 26.9% from 33% (revenue share is likely north of 40%).

2017,"Apple's CC: iPad sales, margins, M&A, cash balances discussed","Jul. 22, 2014, 6:28 PM","

FQ3 iPad (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales were hurt by channel inventory cuts, Tim Cook states on the CC. He adds emerging markets tablet demand is holding up better than U.S. demand - PC sales have been rebounding in the latter - and that Apple is counting on its IBM partnership to boost business iPad sales; U.S. business penetration is pegged at 20%.
Over half of all iPad buyers are still first-time buyers - that points to both growing penetration and relatively low upgrade rates. The tablet market's growth has slowed considerably in recent quarters.
CFO Luca Maestri states cost improvements contributed to the FQ3 gross margin beat; a mix shift towards iPhones (have higher margins than iPads) also didn't hurt. He hints new products are partly responsible for the conservative FQ4 margin guidance.
Also mentioned: 1) Apple has bought 5 more companies since the end of FQ2. 2) The cash balance rose $13.9B Q/Q to $164.5B; 84% of it is offshore. 3) NAND flash, mobile DRAM, and LCD prices fell in FQ3, while PC DRAM prices rose. 4) iTunes revenue rose 8% to $2.6B.
With iPhone mix shifting towards emerging markets, iPhone ASP fell to $561 from $596 in FQ2 and $637 in FQ1; Cook suggests 5C sales were strong. iPad ASP was $443 vs. $465 in FQ2 and $440 in FQ1. Mac ASP fell to $1,255 vs. $1,334 in FQ2 and $1,322 in FQ1.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has placed orders for 70M-80M 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhone 6 units to be manufactured by Dec. 30, the WSJ reports. That's a sizable increase from the 50M-60M iPhone 5S/5C units Apple initially ordered last year.
Orders can change significantly based on consumer demand - for example, iPhone 5C orders were slashed, and 5S orders increased, following last year's launches. But the report still suggests Cupertino expects strong pent-up demandfor bigger iPhones. If accurate, it's a positive for Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS).
A Taiwanese paper reported two weeks ago Apple had already put in orders for 68M iPhone 6 units. Prior to that, a report stated Foxconn is hiring 100K workers to help with iPhone 6 production.
The WSJ's report comes ahead of Tuesday's FQ3 report. With shares up 26% since the FQ2 report, expectations have risen a bit. UBS just hiked its Apple target by $15 to $115, and raised its FQ3 estimates above consensus on data pointing to a mix shift towards the 5S and iPad Air.
The firm is cautious about FQ4, noting checks point to possible iPhone 6 supply constraints for display-related components (previous: I, II). But it's also upbeat about FY15 margin gains, as capex growth slows and the impact of a 2013 revenue deferral policy change fades.

Should an appeals court fail to rule in its favor, Apple (AAPL -0.5%) has agreed to pay $450M to settle its long-running e-book price-fixing probe, with $400M going to consumers. A successful appeal could lower the sum to $70M ($50M for consumers), or clear Apple of any payments.
Five publishers have already agreed to pay a combined $166M to settle price-fixing allegations. Today's disclosure comes after state attorneys general and consumers filed an $840M suit against Apple in February over its e-book deals, and an injunction was placed last September restricting the types of e-book deals Apple can make.
Apple's settlement was originally announced in June, but terms were confidential until now. E-books make up only a small fraction of Apple's iTunes/Software/Services revenue (totaled $4.6B in FQ2).

The Apple (AAPL +1.2%)/IBM (IBM +2.4%) deal is a ""landmark agreement,"" that gives Apple ""enterprise capabilities and credibility at one stroke,"" says Forrester's Frank Gillett. He notes that while the BYOD trend has bolstered Apple's enterprise presence, the company has until now ""resisted servicing enterprises"" out of fear of hurting its user experience.
Endpoint Technologies' Roger Kay: ""What [the deal] allows Apple to do is not change its philosophy and lay off to IBM the whole issue of, how do you make iPhones work for IT managers who actually want to be treated like a valued customer.""

Tim Cook: ""We?™re good at building a simple experience and in building devices ... The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn?™t in our DNA. But it is in IBM?™s."" He also highlights the value of IBM's 100K+ consultants/sales workers.

RBC and Canaccord both think iPhone sales could get a boost; the former is also upbeat about the premium AppleCare service that will be developed. Baird thinks the deal ""could help AAPL cement iOS as the preferred platform for enterprise.""
Piper's Gene Munster, however, doesn't see a huge hardware impact. ""We note that if half of the Fortune 500 were to each purchase an incremental 2,000 iPhones and 1,000 iPads above what they were planning to purchase ... it would mean about a half a percent to CY15 revenue."" He also expects IBM to eventually offer similar Android solutions.

Reitzes, who downgraded Apple in February following many years of being bullish, also thinks Samsung's recent issues provide a buffer, and that checks for new products (in terms of build orders, demand, and quality) are strong.

As 9to5 Mac notes, Kuo has a mixed track record for predicting product launch dates, but has a better record when it comes to predicting product specs.
Reuters reported in June the iWatch will enter mass-production in July. The WSJ?followed up by reporting two models are on tap, and that they'll have ""more than 10 sensors to track and monitor health and fitness data."" The paper suggested mass-production would start in the Aug./Sep. timeframe.
China's state-owned CCTV has called the iPhone a threat to national security due to the ability of its Frequent Locations feature to track users. The criticism comes amid NSA-related tensions, and shortly after the Chinese government ordered local carriers to slash their subsidies for the iPhone and other high-end devices.
Last year, Chinese media and a government agency criticized Apple for its repair/warranty policies. The criticism ended after Tim Cook issued an apology and announced policy changes.

Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) would benefit from strong iPhone build activity. Orders, of course, can end up being drastically increased or pared back due to end-user demand.

IDC estimates U.S. Mac unit shipments fell 1.7% Y/Y in Q2 to 1.68M. With the U.S. PC market growing 6.9%, Apple's share fell 90 bps to 10% (#4 overall). Revenue share is doubtlessly higher.

Parks Associates estimates Roku accounted for 46% of 2013 U.S streaming set-top (non-pay-TV) sales, and Apple TV 26%. A survey of U.S. broadband households with at least one such set-top found 44% used a Roku box the most, and 26% used Apple TV the most.

The WSJ backs up several other reports (previous) stating TSMC (TSM +2.3%) has begun producing an Apple CPU (likely the A8) using the foundry's cutting-edge 20nm process. More interestingly, the paper reports Apple and TSMC have begun work on testing CPUs to be made using a 16nm process.
TSMC plans to launch a 16nm process (called FinFET+) next year that delivers major performance/power efficiency gains relative to its 20nm process. Digitimes has reported TSMC is working on a version of FinFET+ ""tailored to Apple's requirements,"" as part of its efforts to manufacture Apple's A9 CPU.

The Chinese government has told China Mobile (CHL -0.4%), China Unicom (CHU +1.3%), and China Telecom (CHA -0.3%) to slash phone subsidies and advertising by a combined RMB40B ($6.4B) in 3 years, Bloomberg reports.
The government came to its decision after concluding carriers are spending too much to promote the iPhone (AAPL -1.8%) and other high-end hardware. While a large chunk of Chinese phone sales are unsubsidized, subsidies have been growing as carriers try to sign up higher-income subs to 3G/4G postpaid plans.
A possible motivation: Apple and Samsung control much of the high-end Chinese phone market, while local firms (both OEM and white-label) control much of the mid-range and low-end.
China Mobile, which began selling the iPhone in January, has forecast its subsidy spend will rise 29% in 2014 to RMB29B ($4.7B). China Telecom says it has already been ""implementing stringent control on [its] selling expenses to ensure operating profitability.??
UBS, generally upbeat about Apple this year, thinks subsidy cuts and Samsung price cuts could slow Apple's Chinese momentum. The company's Greater China sales rose 13% Y/Y in FQ2 to $9.3B.
The Bloomberg report comes as Samsung says it expects to report soft Q2 smartphone/tablet sales. Among other things, the company blames tough low-end/mid-range phone competition, and weak tablet market demand caused by phablet cannibalization and low upgrade rates. CIRP has observed iPad upgrade cycles are notably longer than iPhone upgrade cycles.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has agreed to settle an antitrust lawsuit regarding e-book price fixing, effectively avoiding a trial. The case was filed by U.S. states and other complainants, hitting Apple with $840M in claims. The lawsuit was connected to a case filed by the Justice Department in April 2012 that charged Apple and five American book publishers of conspiring to fix e-book prices and attempting to break Amazon's hold on the market with its Kindle. The terms of the settlement, which still needs court approval, have not been disclosed.  ",,,
2042,"Reports: Apple facing EU tax probe, building huge ad team","Jun. 10, 2014, 7:18 PM","

Irish broadcaster RTE reports the EU will launch a formal investigation of Apple's (AAPL +0.6%) Irish tax arrangements.
Apple's use of favorable Irish tax laws allowed it to pay just a 3.7% tax rate on non-U.S. income during its last fiscal year. That, in turn, is a big reason $132.2B of Apple's $150.6B? cash balance at the end of FQ2 was offshore.
Tim Cook was grilled by Congress last year over Apple's offshore tax payments; Cook responded in part by calling for an overhaul of the oft-criticized U.S. corporate tax code.
Meanwhile, AdAge reports Apple is ""madly building an internal [ad] agency that it's telling recruits will eventually number 1,000 [employees],"" and by doing so is set to move projects away from historical agency partner TBWA/MAL.
Apple has also reportedly invited other agencies to collaborate on big projects, as it tries to overhaul its marketing after recent campaigns failed to meet expectations.
In e-mails unearthed during the latest Samsung trial, marketing chief Phil Schiller voiced concerns about Samsung's ad campaigns, and also asked Cook if Apple should replace TBWA/MAL.

39M iPhones (AAPL +0.1%) will be sold in the June quarter, better than a 35M consensus, according to Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise tracker.
The MS forecast implies 25% Y/Y unit growth, better than FQ2's 17%. Analyst Katy Huberty thinks strong promotional activity for cheaper iPhones (pressuring ASPs, but boosting units) is helping.
Though AlphaWise's methodology lends itself to criticism - per MS, it ""compiles sell-through data using Web search analysis"" - its track record is solid. It forecast 40.6M FQ2 iPhone sales vs. actual sales of 43.7M and a 38M consensus, and 50.5M FQ1 iPhone sales vs. actual sales of 51M and a 53M consensus.
The MS report comes shortly after BlueFin Research reported checks point to healthy iPhone/iPad build activity ahead of fall refreshes.

An NFC radio would likely help enable Apple's rumored mobile payments service. Top NFC chipmaker NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) must be pleased to see the report, which comes as Chinese carriers get set to adopt NFC on a large scale.
TechCrunch reports Apple has bought Spotsetter, developer of a local search app that relied on social media info, reviews, and other data to recommend local businesses over a map-based UI.
The purchase meshes with Apple's growing mapping/search investments. It bought Twitter search engine Topsy last December, and this week showed off a big overhaul for its Spotlight search tool.
Brian White's Apple Monitor (tracks the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) is up 6%-7% M/M in May, much better than a 9-year average of 2%. White sees the Apple Monitor rising 18%-20% Q/Q for the whole of Q2, ahead of the iPhone 6 launch.

 The Nikkei reports the iWatch (AAPL +0.2%) is expected to arrive in October, and (per a parts supplier) will see initial production of 3M-5M units/month. In-line with past rumors, the device is said to feature a curved OLED display and health sensors that monitor data such as ""calorie consumption, sleep activity, blood glucose and blood oxygen levels."" Apple is only 4 days removed from unveiling its HealthKit platform, which (together with an iOS Health app) aims to give an integrated view of health/fitness data from hardware sensors and 3rd-party apps/services. Samsung integrated several health sensors into the Galaxy S5, and Google has made health monitoring a key part of its new Android Wear platform.
Citing talks with current/former Apple employees, BuzzFeed reports the iTunes team was ""plagued by shortsighted management"" that ignored competitors, ahead of the Beats deal. Some managers reportedly refused to ""open or use Spotify,"" and some didn't know it was an on-demand streaming service (rather than a radio service). Others referred to Pandora as a ""dead company.""
A 9to5 Mac report stating Apple has submitted a spec to enable headphones featuring Lightning (rather than 3.5mm) connectors has fueled speculation future Beats headphones will support Lightning.
In addition to potentially improving audio quality for high-end headphones, a Lightning connector could allow users to control/launch apps via their headphones, and to charge an iDevice using an external battery.

2047,Apple's Spotlight search dumps Google in favor of Bing,"Jun. 3, 2014, 11:11 AM","

Along with announcing a major revamp of iOS and Mac OS X's Spotlight search tool - integrated local/Web search, location-specific results, and more content-specific search options are some of the new features, Apple (AAPL +1.2%) has quietly disclosed it's dropping Google (GOOG -1.5%) as Spotlight's Web search provider in favor of Bing (MSFT -1%).
Importantly, Google remains the default search provider for Safari, which in turn acts as the default iOS/Mac OS browser. But the Spotlight switch is still a noteworthy loss for Google, given the feature's tight integration with Apple's platforms - an iOS user only has to swipe down from his/her home screen to access Spotlight, and a new search box will provide quick access for Mac OS users.
As for Bing, the deal provides a needed mobile win for a search engine estimated by StatCounter to have just a 5.48% global mobile/tablet search share as of May - 1.77% for Bing proper, 3.71% for Yahoo - to Google's 93.5%. Bing replaced Google as Siri's search engine last year.
Separately, Apple has added DuckDuckGo as a Safari search option (along with Google, Bing, and Yahoo). DuckDuckGo tries to differentiate itself by emphasizing its privacy and security features - among other things, it doesn't store IP addresses or log user info.

HomeKit also integrates with Siri - saying ""Get ready for bed"" can result in a connected house automatically locking its doors and dimming its lights.
Apple promises iOS 8 will deliver major GPU performance enhancements, such as a 10x increase in draw-call rates. Electronic Arts (EA -1.9%) is bringing its powerful Frostbite engine to the platform.
For the first time, iOS will support 3rd-party keyboards. Swype owner Nuance (NUAN) has ticked slightly higher in response. The OS will also add support for inter-app communications, a feature long requested by developers.
Also: 1) Siri now has a Google Now-like always-on mode. Saying ""Hey, Siri"" activates the service. 2) The Touch ID fingerprint sensor has been opened up to 3rd-party apps. 3) Like Yosemite, iOS 8 supports 3rd-party Notification Center widgets.
As expected, iOS 8 will launch to consumers in the fall (likely in tandem with the iPhone 6).

Questions are flying about Apple's intentions for Beats, and whether the deal represents a big strategy change. While Apple has bought plenty of component, software, and services firms over the years, it has shied away from acquiring established electronics hardware brands in favor of a do-it-yourself approach. Also, audiophiles generally aren't huge fans of Beats' headphones.
At the same time, Beats, as a consumer brand known for premium pricing, a loyal customer base, and simple/iconic design, has more than a few things in common with Apple.
Music industry sources tell re/code Beats is doing over $1B/year in sales. The site also speculates Apple is interested in Beats' streaming service - Billboard reported in March Apple is talking with labels about a subscription streaming service, and is thinking of offering an iTunes Android app.
Apple -0.4% premarket. Pandora (NYSE:P) -3.2%; the company is no stranger to selling off on reports of Apple music forays.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may announce a $3.2B deal to acquire headphone maker (and streaming music hawkers) Beats Electronics as soon as next week, Financial Times reports, though final details might still derail it. An agreement to acquire the Dr. Dre/Jimmy Iovine-founded firm would be Apple's biggest ever, and a departure from Steve Jobs-era reticence on big purchases. Beats was valued at a little over $1B after taking a $500M investment from Carlyle in September.  ",,,

April checks indicated the iPhone 5S (AAPL -0.9%) was the top-selling phone at all major U.S. carriers as well as in many global channels, writes Canaccord's Mike Walkley while upping his PT by $50 to $660. He adds U.S. sales ""came down from March levels"" following Samsung's Galaxy S5 launch.
Walkley also reports of strong interest in smartphone early upgrade programs, and thinks the offerings are giving a lift to high-end smartphone sales. T-Mobile has seen strong uptake for its Jump upgrade program, and AT&T stated last month its Next upgrade program saw 2.9M sign-ups in Q1.
Like Pac Crest, Walkley thinks Apple could charge a premium for a bigger iPhone. Jefferies has reported Apple is trying to push through an iPhone 6 price hike, with carriers playing hardball for now.
Apple is two weeks removed from reporting stronger-than-expected March quarter iPhone sales. Solid emerging markets/4S demand contributed to the growth; that, in turn, led ASP to drop $41 Q/Q to $596.

Joel Greenblatt's screen looks to find stocks with high ""earnings yield"" - a high ratio of profits to enterprise value. Companies are further screened for a strong return on capital. When a stock scores well with both criteria, it's usually a good company being undervalued by investors.
For picking individual stocks, there are probably better methods, but as a group, Magic Formula names have vastly outperformed the broad market.
Although defense names have done well over the past couple of years, the Magic Formula continues to identify Northrop Grumman (NOC +0.2%), General Dynamics (GD +1.4%), and Raytheon (RTN +0.6%) as attractive. Firearm names Smith & Wesson (SWHC +0.8%) and Sturm Ruger (RGR +0.3%) also make the cut.
A number of videogame makers show up as well: Take-Two (TTWO +0.3%), Activision Blizzard (ATVI +0.2%), GameStop (GME +2.8%), and the struggling recent IPO King Digital (KING -0.3%).
Not too surprisingly, the Magic Formula also continues to like plenty of big-cap tech names: Cisco (CSCO -0.2%), CA, Inc. (CA -0.5%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.5%), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ -0.5%), and Apple (AAPL +0.1%).
Hardly market laggards, media names like Time Warner (TWX -0.8%), Viacom (VIA +1.4%), Omnicom Group (OMC), and Starz (STRZA +2.3%) also show up on the list, as do struggling multi-level marketers and for-profit education stocks: HLF, NUS, APOL, ESI-OLD, CPLA.

Citing strong phablet sales and extended upgrade cycles (something CIRP has already observed), IDC estimates global tablet shipments only rose 3.9% Y/Y in Q1 to 50.4M units. That's a marked slowdown from Q4's 28.2% growth, and also below IDC's full-year growth forecast of 19.4%.
Worth noting: Q1 comps were especially tough, given IDC estimated year-ago shipments were up 142% Y/Y. Easier comps for later quarters could help growth rebound a bit.
Apple (AAPL +0.3%), which last week reported its Q1 iPad units fell 16% Y/Y to 16.4M (Tim Cook partly blamed inventory changes), saw its share drop to 32.5% from 33.2% in Q4 and 40.2% a year ago. With the iPad's ASP at a steep $465, Apple's revenue share might still be above 50%.
Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) tablets now make up ~2/3 of shipments - that's a positive for Google's traffic acquisition costs, given the huge Mobile Safari search ad payments it makes to Apple.
Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) grew its share to 22.3% from 18.8% in Q4 and 17.5% a year ago. Asus (OTC:ASUUY) had 5% of the market vs. 5.4% a year ago, and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) grew its share to 4.1% from a mere 1.3%.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to deliver annual dividend hikes going forward, new CFO Luca Maestri states on the CC. With the company's domestic cash balance now at $18B, Apple will once more tap debt markets to help pay for its dividend and freshly-expanded buyback program. (CC live blogs: I, II) Tim Cook partly attributes FQ2's soft iPad sales to inventory changes; slowing tablet market growth might also be playing a role. iPad ASP was at $465, up from $440 in FQ1 and and $439 in FQ4 (suggests a mix shift towards the iPad Air). Healthy emerging markets demand contributed to iPhone strength - BRIC sales hit a record, thanks in part to China Mobile. iPhone ASP came in at $596 vs. $637 in FQ1 and $577 in FQ4; Maestri suggests a mix shift towards the 4S contributed to the Q/Q drop. Cook states Apple has bought 24 companies in the last 18 months - some are known to the public, but not all - and is ""on the prowl"" for deals. ""We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally and we don?™t have a rule that says we can?™t spend a lot or whatever.""

4 months after launching 4G services and 3 months after beginning 4G iPhone (AAPL -0.1%) sales, China Mobile has announced it only had 2.79M 4G subs at the end of Q1.
One caveat: Not all of China Mobile's iPhone sales necessarily go to subs signing up for 4G services. China Mobile announced last month it added ~1M iPhone users and 1.34M 4G subs in February.
The WSJ takes a look at the efforts of U.S. carriers to lower subsidy spend, in part by offering discounts to consumers forgoing subsidies. AT&T's Randall Stephenson: ""The industry is at a place where you can actually see line of sight to the subsidy equation just fundamentally changing in a very short period of time.""
Apple's newest iPhones are typically subsidized by ~$450 by U.S. carriers in exchange for 2-year contracts. Tim Cook mentioned in January a shift by U.S. carriers to a hard 24-month wait between subsidies hurt FQ1 iPhone sales.

Expectations are low ahead of Wednesday's FQ2 report. Canaccord's checks suggest iPhone sales slowed in April due to competition and iPhone 6 anticipation. Also, UBS has cut FQ2/FQ3 iPhone estimates on concerns of weaker China Mobile and U.S. sales, and the consensus is for iPad sales to be flat to down Y/Y.
At the same time, many expect a dividend hike to be announced, and hopes are high for the iPhone 6. Susquehanna's checks lead it to think Apple is asking for 20%-30% more capacity from suppliers relative to the iPhone 5 and 5S launches.

Re/code reports Apple (AAPL +1.2%) ""has been interviewing senior payments industry executives to push ahead on a plan to build an electronic payments business."" E-commerce chief Jennifer Bailey is said to be leading the initiative. ""Their ambitions are very, very serious,"" says one source.
The WSJ reported in January Apple is ""laying the groundwork"" for a mobile payments push, albeit while leaving many questions unanswered regarding the kinds of transactions that will be covered, and which payments technologies will be used. Tim Cook later stated Apple is ""intrigued"" by the mobile payments space.
Apple has ~600M iTunes accounts (most of which are linked to credit cards) to leverage for a payments initiative, as well as complementary technologies such as fingerprint sensors and the iBeacon positioning platform. Android support (something Apple is reportedly considering for iTunes) would do a lot to extend the service's reach in markets where Google's OS dominates.

""Our checks indicate Apple (AAPL -0.3%) has started negotiating with carriers on a $100 iPhone 6 price increase. The initial response has been no, but there seems to be an admission that there is no other game-changing device this year,"" says Jefferies' Peter Misek.

Pac Crest cited the potential for higher iPhone 6 prices (owing to their expected larger displays) as a reason for upgrading Apple a month ago. As it is, the iPhone had a $637 ASP in the Dec. quarter, +$60 Q/Q thanks to strong 5S and soft 5C sales.

IDC estimates the smartphone industry's ASP was only at $335 last year, and will fall to $308 in 2014, as emerging markets continue growing their share of industry sales.
There's a good chance carriers will try to pass on most or all of any price hike to consumers, particularly given their recent efforts to lower subsidy spend, Pricing for Samsung's 5.7"" Galaxy Note 3 (often sold for $300-$350 subsidized by U.S. carriers) points to an effort by carriers to charge a premium for high-end phablets.
In such a scenario, Apple would doubtlessly be counting on its high customer loyalty, along with pent-up demand for a bigger iPhone, to keep iPhone sales from slipping.

Kuo also expects the devices to have 1344x750 and 1920x1080 resolutions, run on the next-gen A8 CPU (no surprise), support optical image stabilization, and have side power buttons. The 5.5"" model (reportedly seeing touch sensor-related delays) is expected later in 2H14 than the 4.7"" model.
The much-anticipated iWatch is expected at the end of Q3. Kuo sees models with 1.3"" and 1.5"" displays launching, and expects them to include NFC chips, wireless charging support, and biometric (fingerprint?) recognition.
Apple has thus far held off on including NFC chips within its hardware. But they could assist with its rumored payments efforts.
The next-gen iPad Air and retina iPad Mini will both reportedly feature an A8 CPU and a fingerprint sensor, and the former will also get an 8MP camera. Kuo also thinks Apple is working on a 12.9"" iPad (as rumored), but doesn't expect it this year.

The Nikkei reports Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is in talks with Renesas (OTCPK:RNECF) to buy its 55% stake in iPhone LCD driver IC supplier Renesas SP Drivers, and is looking to acquire it for Â¥50B ($479M).
Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY) owns 25% of Renesas SP, and Taiwan's Powerchip 20%. Sharp is expected to sell its stake to Apple if the company asks for a a deal after buying Renesas' interest.
Apple, which already develops its own app processors and fingerprint sensors, reportedly ""wants to meld the design of core display components into overall product development.""
A deal could be a positive for Himax (HIMX +3.9%) and MagnaChip (MX -0.6%), given Renesas SP's other clients would start looking for alternative LCD driver suppliers. Renesas SP has an estimated ~33% share of the market for small and mid-sized LCD drivers/controllers. It had revenue of Â¥60B ($575M) during the fiscal year ending March 31.

""It?™s difficult to imagine a world in which Comcast would give up its network and control of customers that are streaming data through such a service,"" writes TechCrunch's Ryan Lawler, demonstrating the skepticism that has followed the WSJ's report about Apple's (AAPL +1.1%) TV service talks with Comcast.
In addition to doubts about Comcast's support, there are questions about Apple's ability to reach deals with TV network owners. Intel's pay-TV ambitions were derailed by a failure to reach such deals; Verizon, which bought Intel's TV unit, is hoping to launch a Web TV service with the help of FiOS' existing deals.
Also: Many think regulators would scrutinize an arrangement that provides Apple's services with dedicated network capacity.
One of the WSJ's sources states Apple and Comcast aren't close to a deal, with differences over customer control and data remaining an issue. In addition, the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is said to have stalled talks between Apple and TWC to have a next-gen Apple TV set-top support TWC's content (a much simpler proposition).

9to5 Mac has reported a new Apple TV set-top could arrive in 1H14. iLounge and others have reported the device will feature game controller support.
Skepticism or not, Comcast set-top supplier Arris (ARRS -6.1%) is down sharply amid a tech selloff.

Apple (AAPL +0.8%) appears ""headed for a second-half sales bonanza"" fueled by the arrival of one or more large-screen iPhone 6 models, writes Barron's Jack Hough.
He thinks the iPhone 6 launch could lead the percentage of iPhone owners who upgrade in a quarter to return to peak levels of 12%-14% later this year, after having fallen to ~9% in recent quarters. The iPhone has an installed base of 260M users.
Hough also exudes praise for Apple's ""hardware-as-a-service"" business model, and thinks shares could rise 20% to $635, or 13.6x C2015E EPS, next year, given Microsoft currently goes for 14.4x C2014E EPS.
Meanwhile, Pac Crest and UBS are each out with bullish notes. Pac Crest's checks lead it to think March and June quarter iPhone volumes could exceed its estimates of 39.7M and 33.6M, and that initial iPhone 6 component orders ""[provide] a positive bias to our previous unit expectations.""
UBS thinks the March and June quarters could be soft, largely due to iPhone 5C and iPad weakness, but thinks Sep. quarter sales will be healthy thanks to iPhone 6 demand.
Apple is ticking higher in the face of a 1.7% Nasdaq drop, as is supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS +1.3%).

2104,CIRP: iPad upgrade cycles longer than iPhone cycles,"Mar. 21, 2014, 7:12 PM","

Whereas iPhones (NASDAQ:AAPL) are typically replaced in the U.S. once every two years (as contracts expire), a CIRP survey of 2K consumers who bought an iPhone, iPad, or Mac in 2013 leads the firm to think iPads will see upgrade cycles closer to Macs (2-4 years) or TVs (5-10 years).
Even as of Dec. 2013, 78% of iPad buyers were purchasing a unit for the first time. That figure is down just moderately from March's 84%, and implies both healthy installed base growth and a slow pace to upgrades. Moreover, upgrading iPad owners were more than twice as likely as iPhone owners to give an older model to a friend or family member.
The survey provides some context for the broader tablet industry's growth slowdown. IDC expects both tablet and smartphone shipments to grow 19% this year, even though the smartphone market is nearly 5x the size of the tablet market.
The iPhone accounted for 56% of Apple's Dec. quarter revenue, and the iPad 20%.

Apple hasn't yet begun offering the 8GB model in the U.S., nor has it discontinued the 8GB iPhone 4S (Â£349 in the U.K.).
Also: Apple is discontinuing the iPad 2, and will now offer the 4th-gen iPad at the iPad 2's old price points (16GB Wi-Fi-only model goes for $399).

Leaked documents from German carrier O2 indicate Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is launching an 8GB iPhone 5C sporting a local retail price ??0 ($83) below that of the current 16GB 5C.
The launch of an 8GB 5C could lead Apple to discontinue the 8GB iPhone 4S, currently the cheapest available model in most markets (the iPhone 4 is still available in some emerging markets). The 4S goes for an unsubsidized $450 in the U.S. (it's free with subsidies), and the 16GB 5C for $550.
Sales of the plastic-shell 5C have underwhelmed, as buyers in most markets overwhelmingly opt for the more advanced, aluminum, 5S. Soft 5C sales were a reason Apple missed Dec. quarter iPhone unit forecasts, albeit while posting a $60 Q/Q iPhone ASP increase.

However, Jobs expressed an interest in controlling the living room. In 2011, Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson quoted the Apple co-founder as saying he'd like to ""create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use.""
While predictions of an Apple TV set launch have been consistently off, the Apple TV set-top has turned into a $1B/year business (after factoring content spend), and is expected to see a 2014 refresh that will add support for game controllers and pay-TV content. In addition, Apple recently snapped up gesture recognition sensor developer PrimeSense.
Whether for TV sets, set-tops, or both, Hollywood's unwillingness to agree to content deals that would seriously disrupt the pay-TV industry's status quo have affected the living room ambitions of Apple, Intel, Microsoft, and others.
Separately, Jony Ive has provided a fresh interview in which he reiterates Apple's product philosophy.

Citing ""slowing consumer purchases"" amid high penetration rates in mature markets, IDC now forecasts tablet shipments will grow 19.4% in 2014 (to 260.9M units), down from a prior estimate of 22% (271M units).
Tablet growth steadily slowed in 2014: Shipments rose an estimated 142% in Q1, but just 28% in Q4. IDC puts full-year growth at 52%.
Two silver linings for high-end/enterprise leader Apple (AAPL - 33.8% Q4 share): 1) ASPs are only expected to drop 3.6% in 2014, after falling 14.6% in 2013, as more consumers embrace ""higher-end devices."" 2) Commercial buyers are expected to account for 14% of shipments, up from 11% in 2013.
IDC also thinks Windows (NASDAQ:MSFT) tablets, struggling to gain a strong consumer foothold, will take over a quarter of the commercial segment thanks to rising convertible adoption.
The revised forecast still puts tablet sales within striking distance of eclipsing PC sales: IDC expects PC shipments to drop 6% this year to 295.9M. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow 19% to 1.2B.

India, which has a sub-10% smartphone penetration rate, still presents a major growth opportunity. But with a nominal per capita GDP of ~$1,500, the country is even more cost-sensitive than China.

Apple (AAPL -0.8%) has bought Burstly, developer of a popular mobile app testing platform (TestFlight) and a management solution for in-app ads (SkyRocket). TechCrunch initially reported the purchase, and re/code confirmed it soon afterwards.
Bustly asserts ""most of the world's developers"" rely on TestFlight for for app beta testing, crash reporting, and analytics. Unsurprisingly, the company recently shut down Android support.
Look for Apple to add TestFlight (one of several independent app testing platforms on the market) to its arsenal of iOS developer tools. As it is, companies have often reported their development costs are lower for iOS apps than for Android counterparts.
Facebook has also shown a keen interest in mobile development/testing tools.

Barclays' Ben Reitzes, a staunch Apple (AAPL -1%) bull for years, has downgraded shares to Equalweight, albeit while maintaining his $570 PT.
Reitzes thinks Apple will be in a trading range for the next year due to a maturing smartphone market and the margin impact of adding new iPhone features such as ""sapphire glass, curved glass, and new batteries.""
He also compares Apple's current valuation to Microsoft's from 2000-2010, and argues there's ""no precedent that large-size tech companies simply start to broadly outperform again after a tough year or two if the law of large numbers is catching up to them and margins have peaked.""
Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA +8.2%) founder/CEO Elon Musk has confirmed a recent report that he met with Apple's management, but declines to comment on whether ""any kind of acquisition"" was discussed.
The San Francisco Chronicle recently reported Musk met with Apple M&A chief Adrian Perica and ""probably"" Tim Cook last April. It's worth noting Tesla shares traded at a fraction of current levels at the time; the EV maker's current market cap is $26B.
Many observers have drawn comparisons between Apple and Tesla in the past. An Apple board member has claimed Steve Jobs dreamed of designing an iCar.

Another industry exec talking with Ad Age says Amazon's lack of a personal touch when courting Madison Ave. hurts its success.
After interviewing ""a dozen people close to the companies,"" Ad Age suggests both Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are experiencing growing pains as they try to grow their ad ops. While advertising is largely a sideshow for Apple - Tim Cook has said iAd's main goal is to help developers make money - Amazon wants to use its oceans of data to mount a challenge to 800-lb. gorilla Google, as well as drive more e-commerce activity.
Nonetheless, Amazon has been cautious about sharing transactional data with ad agencies. One exec says Amazon hasn't agreed to a request to ""divulge data about what's in shoppers' carts to inform ads."" Another suggests the company could be more proactive in providing case studies.

Apple's decision to keep the iPad 2 (originally launched in 2011) around at an unchanged price of $399 following last fall's Air/retina Mini launches raised eyebrows. Wal-Mart recently offered the iPad 2 for $299 in a promotion.
Images said to depict iPhone 6 casings have leaked out of China. The images show a device that has a larger screen than the 4"" iPhone 5S/5C, and is also thinner.
The WSJ, Bloomberg, and others have reported Apple plans to launch two larger iPhones; Bloomberg's reported stated the screen sizes will respectively be 4.7"" and 5.5"".
Jefferies' Peter Misek has cut his FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone sales forecast by 3M to 33M, citing checks that point to builds of only 25M-30M and expectations of soft demand ahead of an iPhone 6 launch.

A handful of smartphones already support inductive charging, and so does Qualcomm's proof-of-concept Toq smartwatch.

The report coincides with one from the NYT stating Apple execs have met with FDA directors to ""discuss mobile medical applications."" Both reports follow Apple's hiring of medical/fitness experts, and amid expectations the iWatch will offer a variety of health/fitness features.

Peter Oppenheimer states channel inventory shifts are partly responsible for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ2 sales guidance. Whereas inventories rose in FQ2 a year ago due to iPhone 5/iPad Mini shortages in FQ1, Apple exited this year's FQ1 with iPhone/iPad supply and demand nearly in balance. Of course, that also means inventory shifts gave a lift to Apple's Y/Y performance in FQ1.
Oppenheimer also notes the impact of revenue deferrals - Apple's deferred revenue balance rose 13% Q/Q to $11.4B, as a portion of hardware sales get deferred due to software/services bundling.
Tim Cook says changes in carrier policies (a hard requirement for 24 months between subsidized upgrades) hurt North American iPhone sales; U.S. carriers have been trying hard to lower subsidy expenses. On the other hand, Cook declares last week (China Mobile's launch week) was Apple's best yet for Chinese iPhone activations.

Cook on mobile payments: ""The mobile payments area in general is one that we?™ve been intrigued with and that was one of the thoughts behind the Touch ID. But we?™re not limiting ourselves just to that."" The comments come in the wake of the WSJ's report about an Apple payments service.
Also: 1) 78% of Apple's $159B cash/investment balance is offshore. 2) Japanese iPhone sales, boosted by DoCoMo's launch, rose 40% Y/Y. But a weak yen resulted in Apple's total Japanese revenue rising only 11%. Chinese iPhone sales rose 20%. 3) Cook doesn't say much about buybacks in the face of Carl Icahn's ongoing campaign, other than to reiterate Apple has ""been a big believer"" in them.

Apple (AAPL +1.2%) is rising going into today's FQ1 report, and PayPal parent eBay (EBAY -2%) is selling off, after the WSJ reported Apple is hatching plans for a mobile payments service. Point-of-sale hardware vendors VeriFone (PAY -2.3%) and NCR (NCR -2.6%) are also lower.
The report left some major questions unanswered. A big one: Will Apple's service only cover transactions taking place in physical stores, or will it also cover mobile e-commerce transactions?
The latter would be a much larger threat to PayPal, which handled $27B worth of mobile transactions (largely e-commerce-related) in 2013, but for now only has a small presence in the offline payments realm (the company is trying hard to change that).
Given Apple's history, an Apple payments service is unlikely to support Android. That could limit merchant interest in regions where Android has a dominant smartphone share (the EU, Latin America, parts of Asia), assuming Apple plans to take the service overseas.

Carl Icahn mentioned payments as a major growth opportunity for Apple last week, highlighting the company's ability to leverage its 575M+ iTunes accounts, fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon.

Icahn estimates Apple could produce $40B/year in revenue and $15B/year in op. income if its sold 25M TV sets/year (compares with an estimated 2012 market of 238M units) at a $1,600 ASP, and achieved its current company-wide gross margin of 37.7% (well above traditional TV industry margins).
In addition, he views Apple's 575M+ credit card numbers (courtesy of iTunes), fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon mobile positioning platform translating into a huge mobile payments opportunity.
Naturally, Icahn uses his bullish view of Apple's earnings power to argue the company shouldn't be scared to buy back more stock. He doubts Apple needs a major cash hoard for acquisitions, given its conservative M&A track record, and notes it can still raise cheap debt: The company's 5-year bonds yield just 2%, and its 10-year bonds 3.63%.

Backing up several reports in recent months, the WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.8%) plans to launch two larger iPhones in 2H14: One with a 4.5""+ display, and one with a 5""+ display.
The paper adds both devices will use metal casings and won't feature curved displays, and that Apple is ""expected to scrap the plastic exterior used in the iPhone 5C.""
The WSJ previously reported Apple is evaluating iPhones with 4.8""-6"" displays, and Bloomberg has reported Apple plans to launch 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones with ""glass that curves downward at the edges.""
More recently, Cowen's Timothy Arcuri has said supply chain checks point to the launch of a 4.8"" iPhone supporting the high-speed 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard (already supported by various Apple and Samsung devices). Like others, Arcuri also expects a ~13"" iPad to launch this year.
Calls for Apple to offer larger iPhones have been widespread amid soaring demand for large-screen Android devices, particularly in China and other parts of Asia-Pac. The launches could allow Apple to win back some European and Asian smartphone share lost in recent quarters to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) and others.

Sell on the news? After rallying on Wednesday following reports of solid China Mobile iPhone pre-registrations - CNBC reported 1.2M - Apple (AAPL -1.1%) is trading lower on launch day.

The NYT reports ""only about a dozen customers"" showed up at a Beijing store to buy iPhones, in spite of an appearance by Tim Cook, and that the huge lines accompanying some past Apple launches haven't existed.? Launch pictures posted by journalist Jahangir Naina appear to show healthy interest.

China Mobile's pricing is raising eyebrows. The carrier, which has an ARPU in the ~$10/month range, is selling the 16GB iPhone 5S for RMB5,288 ($874) unsubsidized, and for RMB5,488 ($907) with a 2-year, $23/month contract (its cheapest iPhone contract plan). The WSJ observes China Unicom and Telecom offer cheaper iPhone plans.
With the iPhone squaring off against Android phones that (per research firm Umeng) carry an unsubsidized ASP of just $233 within China, China Mobile's pricing/subsidy support could have a big impact on whether the carrier is able to hit bullish sell-side forecasts for 20M+ 2014 iPhone sales.

Also, Chinese site CTech has posted images of what it claims is the frame for a 4.7"" iPhone 6.
More than a few analysts, investors, and writers have been urging Apple to launch bigger phones (could potentially have higher ASPs), and thereby cater to the hundreds of millions of smartphone users who prefer larger screen sizes.
Though showing no signs of doing away with traditional phone subsidies (T-Mobile excepted), U.S. carriers continue to roll out plans that offer discounts for doing without them. AT&T has discounted its shared data plans for unsubsidized users, and is offering an extra $200 in credit to switching T-Mobile users who forgo subsidies; Sprint is offering substantial group discounts to unsubsidized phone buyers; and T-Mobile (already relying on payment plans in lieu of subsidies) is now offering up to $650 in credit to users switching from other carriers.
Apple and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY), as the dominant high-end U.S. smartphone suppliers (and thus the biggest subsidy beneficiaries), have the most at risk from any major decline in subsidized phone purchases.

Gartner and IDC have provided very different figures for Q4 U.S. Mac sales, which benefited from a MacBook/iMac refresh. Gartner thinks they rose 28% Y/Y to 2.2M, leaving Apple with a 13.7% U.S. PC share (+380 bps Y/Y). But IDC thinks they fell 3%, and assigns Apple a 10.9% U.S. PC share (flat Y/Y).

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has filed a patent application for an advanced restaurant reservation/ordering system. The systems would be aware of how much time a customer has spent at a table, would alert waiting customers when a table is ready, and would provide menu recommendations based on customer preferences.
OpenTable (OPEN -4.1%) investors appear nervous about the patent application. However, taking share from OpenTable in the face of the restaurant reservation leader's huge network effect would be an uphill battle, especially if (as one would expect) Apple's offering is only available on mobile devices to iOS users.

An ad on China Mobile's (CHL +0.5%) site suggests the world' biggest carrier will begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 5S (AAPL +0.7%) on Thursday, as well as for 4G phones from Samsung and Sony.

CHL had previously said it was still negotiating with Apple regarding iPhone sales.

The move appears to represent an attempt by the companies to prevent a loss of business because of Edward Snowden's revelations about the scope of the National Security Agency's spying campaign.

Following the WSJ's report about a China Mobile (CHL -0.3%) deal, Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is up 27% from its mid-September low, and (after falling hard to start the year) up 7% YTD.
The gains come even though China Mobile has responded to the WSJ's report by stating it's ""still negotiating with Apple."" The world's biggest carrier has long been rumored to be driving a hard bargain with Apple, which itself has plenty of experience on that front.
As is their custom, analysts have been firing up their spreadsheets to estimate the impact of a China Mobile deal. Uber-bull Brian White thinks the deal could yield 20M-24M additional iPhone sales in 2014, boosting EPS by $4. Gene Munster is a little more cautious, forecasting 17M 2014 sales, as is Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves, who sees only a $2 2014 EPS boost.
Munster notes that while 16GB iPhone 5S and 5C respectively cost $846 and $718 unsubsidized in China, China Mobile has an estimated unsubsidized smartphone ASP of $270 (Verizon, by contrast, is at $449). The rising popularity of large-screen smartphones in China could also act as a headwind (at least until Apple launches one of its own).

Meanwhile, Time has published an Icahn cover story that focuses on his Apple efforts. Icahn tells the magazine he filed his proposal on Nov. 26 (thus making it eligible to be voted on at next year's shareholder meeting), and that he remains a supporter of Tim Cook.
Icahn: ""A lot of people say Steve Jobs probably wouldn?™t have talked to me, and maybe that?™s true ... But I think [Cook] found our conversation sort of interesting. He said, `Look, you?™ve accomplished a lot, and we want to listen to you.?™â€?

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirms it has acquired Topsy, a provider of search/analytics tools used by companies to monitor and analyze Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) commentary from millions of users, and thereby gauge consumer sentiment. Sources tell the WSJ the purchase price was above $200M.
As always, Apple is refusing to comment on its post-acquisition plans. The WSJ notes Topsy, one of the few firms to gain licensed access to Twitter's full data ""firehose,"" could bolster iAd, by providing advertisers with real-time data about trending Twitter subjects. It could also help Apple optimize and provide recommendations for various Internet services.
There has already been plenty of M&A activity (I, II) in the social media marketing software/services space, as companies look to better serve companies directing a growing portion of their digital ad spend towards Facebook, Twitter, and other social platforms. However, most of it has come from enterprise software vendors such as Salesforce, Oracle, and IBM.
The purchase highlights the value being placed on Twitter's user data, and the insights that could potentially be gleaned from it. Twitter generated $47.3M (11% of total revenue) from data licensing sales over the first nine months of 2013, +36% Y/Y.

IBM estimates mobile devices accounted for 25.8% of U.S. Thanksgiving e-commerce sales (up 49% Y/Y), and have accounted for 21.5% of Black Friday e-commerce sales thus far.
Given mobile accounted for an even larger share of e-commerce traffic (42.6% and 37%, respectively), its conversation rates still notably lag PC levels. But the weakness entirely lies with smartphones (9% of Thanksgiving sales vs. 26.6% of traffic) rather than tablets (16.5% vs. 15.3%).
Google (GOOG -0.3%), which has been trying to strengthen its tablet search ad prices via Enhanced Campaigns (requires joint PC/tablet ad campaigns), is probably happy to see that.
On the other hand, Google is probably less happy to see that Android accounted for only 12% of of e-commerce traffic and 4.6% of sales, compared with 30% and 21% for iOS (NASDAQ:AAPL). Monetization figures such as those are a key reason why many developers still write for iOS first, in spite of Android's burgeoning market share lead.

Apple's (AAPL +0.9%) software ecosystem makes its hardware business akin to a recurring revenue stream, and very different from those of fallen mobile giants such as Motorola and BlackBerry, suggests David Einhorn, once more making a bull case for the company. He backs up his argument by pointing to Apple's ~90% customer repurchase rate.
Einhorn, who called on Apple to make a preferred stock distribution earlier this year (he backed off after the company added $50B to its buyback plan), refuses to pass judgment on Carl Icahn's call for another $150B in buybacks - ""Carl?™s view is not particularly important because I don?™t know what Carl?™s thinking"" - but does say ""it makes sense for Apple to maintain a very good, strong cushion, so they can continue to innovate even if the market hits a bad cycle.""
Einhorn's Greenlight Capital owned 2.4M Apple shares at the end of Q3. In his Q3 investor letter, he talked up Apple's e-commerce ops (iTunes/App Store), noting they amount to a $16B/year and growing business.
As for Micron (MU +6.5%), which Einhorn just disclosed a position in, Einhorn says he's a fan of companies in consolidating industries, and notes ""there's an enormous change going on"" in the DRAM industry as it consolidates around Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix.

The WSJ has previously reported Apple is preparing to ship iPhones to China Mobile, and Chinese regulators have certified the iPhone for use on the carrier's 3G and 4G networks. A China Mobile launch is crucial to Apple's efforts to halt Chinese smartphone share losses to cheaper Android phones.
A USPTO examiner has invalidated Apple's '915 patent, which covers pinch-to-zoom and scrolling UI features. Though Apple will doubtlessly appeal, Samsung has filed an emergency motion to halt its damages retrial (previous) against Apple, since the '915 patent was the only one asserted in Apple's California suit for which it was claiming lost profits.

Digitimes reports Apple is taking control of component procurement from its contract manufacturers. If true, that suggests Apple sees room to improve its margins by handling procurement on its own.

Susquehanna notes a large-screen iPhone 6 (widely expected to launch in 2014) could carry a price premium (the firm estimates $50-$100), and thereby allow Apple to halt recent iPhone ASP declines. The current pricing for Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 phablet (AT&T and Verizon sell it for a subsidized $300) lends credence to that argument.

The report comes shortly after Chinese site C Technology, which provided one of the first reports of a 5C order cut, stated Pegatron has cut 5C production to just 80K units/day from 320K/day in October.
Analytics firm Fiksu reports global 5S usage outpaces 5C usage by more than a 3:1 margin (6.9% of all iPhone usage vs. 2.2%). Localytics' activation data has also indicated 5S sales soundly outpace 5C sales.

Walkley also reports 5C sales are ""steady,"" and that silver/space grey 5S supplies were ""much improved"" from September levels, with the 16GB and 32GB models available at many U.S. carrier stores by early November. The gold 5S is said to still be in short supply.
Likewise, Gene Munster, who more than once reported of limited 5S supplies at U.S. stores, now says 5S supplies are nearing an inflection point. On the other hand, iPad Air supplies are believed to be tightening.

Yesterday: Apple roundup

2208,"Apple roundup: tax probe, iWatch, retina Mini supplies, iTV, Distimo, IDC","Nov. 13, 2013, 1:04 PM","

The Italian government is investigating Apple (AAPL +0.2%) for allegedly hiding ??B ($1.34B) from local tax authorities. The investigation comes amid an ongoing EU probe into the tax deals provided by Ireland, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands to Apple and others, and six months after Tim Cook testified at a Senate hearing regarding Apple's tax payments on overseas profits.
DisplaySearch's Tony Hsieh reports Apple plans to sell two iWatch models: a version with a 1.7"" display for men, and a version with a 1.3"" display for women. Past reports have stated multiple iWatch prototypes featuring different display sizes exist.
KGI's well-connected Ming-Chi Kuo predicts Dec. quarter retina iPad Mini shipments will only total 2.2M due to low supplies; March quarter shipments are expected to hit 4.5M. Apple is now taking retina Mini orders through its online store, but retail store buyers have to use its Personal Pickup service for now.

Kuo also reports a new Apple TV set-top featuring an A7 CPU will launch in 2014 (8.2M 2014 shipments are forecast), but doesn't expect an iTV to arrive before late-2015 or early-2016 ""at the earliest."" Gene Munster, whose iTV predictions have been off the mark more than a few times, is now predicting a 2014 launch.

Distimo estimates the App Store still has a 64%/36% revenue edge over Google Play. Though down from May's 71%/29%, that figure is still eye-opening given IDC estimates Android phones by more than 6:1 in Q3 (81% share vs. 12.9%).
Superior monetization, along with lower R&D costs, are key reasons why many developers still write for iOS first and Android second, in spite of a growing market share gap.

2209,Apple begins selling retina iPad Mini,"Nov. 12, 2013, 7:40 AM","

Three weeks after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled the retina iPad Mini, the tablet is available for purchase at Apple's online store. 16GB and 32GB Wi-Fi-only models are showing shipping times of 1-3 business days; other models are at 5-10 business days. The retina Mini had been expected to go on sale on Nov. 22, following a Target leak indicating as much.
Two issues that will be closely watched: 1) Supply constraints. There have been multiple reports stating early Mini supplies will be limited due to display shortages, and Tim Cook admitted on the FQ4 CC it isn't clear if Apple will be able to meet Dec. quarter demand. 2) How much the Mini's premium pricing - the device starts at $399 at a time when the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX, each of which also have high-res displays, start at $229 - will affect sales.
The iPad Air went on sale on Nov. 1. Initial reviews and activation/usage data have been positive.

Albany's Times Union reports GlobalFoundries (the world's #2 chip foundry) is getting set to produce Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) A-series processors at a Malta, NY fab, in partnership with current manufacturer Samsung. TSMC (TSM -1.5%), which has been expected to handle a growing share of A-series production, might not be happy to hear that.

DisplaySearch, which previously suggested an iTV could arrive in 2014, now reports (citing TV industry supply chain sources) Apple's TV plans ""have been put on hold again."" Many an Apple analyst/observer has inaccurately forecast a pending iTV launch in recent years.

Pac Crest's checks lead it to think iPhone sales are roughly flat Y/Y, and that inventories are a little higher due to the 5C. The firm's tone is more subdued than that seen in many recent analyst reports. Meanwhile, BMO has lowered its PT to $585 from $600, the firm now thinks a China Mobile iPhone launch won't happen until 1H14.
The WSJ takes a look at the iPhone's success in Japan, the one big international market where the device's popularity reaches U.S. levels. Contributing factors: A strong brand presence (aided by heavy marketing), high per capita incomes (enables subsidies exceeding U.S. levels), and a Japanese consumer bias against Korean brands such as Samsung.
Apple's Japanese sales rose 41% Y/Y in FQ4, even as sales to Greater China only rose 6%, and those to the rest of Asia-Pac fell 6%.

2211,Icahn: Cook still studying buyback proposal,"Nov. 11, 2013, 12:16 PM","


Carl Icahn tells CNBC he recently had a ""good conversation"" with Tim Cook, and that the Apple (AAPL -0.6%) CEO is still studying Icahn's $150B buyback proposal.
Apple has moved higher on the report, but still remains down on the day.
Three weeks ago, Icahn disclosed his Apple stake had risen to 4.7M shares (worth $2.4B), and said he would ""test the waters"" regarding a proxy fight? if his calls for a bigger buyback were ignored. The following week, Cook stated any changes to Apple's capital allocation plan would be announced early next year.
Apple currently has $146.8B in cash/investments on its balance sheet, but only $35.5B of that is in the U.S. Thanks to a debt offering made earlier this year to help finance its existing back efforts, long-term debt stands at $16.9B.

2212,"Apple reportedly prepping 4.7"" and 5.5"" iPhones with curved screens","Nov. 10, 2013, 11:12 AM","


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to release iPhones featuring 4.7"" and 5.5"" displays, as well as ""glass that curves downward at the edges,"" in 2H14. Apple is also reportedly thinking of integrating ""sensors that can distinguish heavy or light touches on the screen"" in subsequent models; this suggests the inclusion of advanced haptic feedback tech.
There have been plenty of reports indicating Apple is looking to offer one or more iPhones with a larger display next year, as it tries to address soaring demand for phones with larger displays. Demand for such phones, along with a mix shift towards cheaper smartphones, has been pressuring Apple's European and Asian smartphone shares.

Samsung and LG both recently unveiled phones with curved (OLED) screens, but initial volumes have been limited. Proponents of the idea have argued a curved large-screen phone is easier to grip, and offers a greater field of view. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) says it plans to offer phones with foldable displays in about two years.
The inclusion of haptic feedback tech within future iPhone would be a positive for haptic IP developer Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR). Immersion's shares once took off on a rumor (proven unfounded) the 3rd-gen iPad would feature haptic tech developed by Finland's Senseg.
Bloomberg's report comes as Apple gets set to buy huge volumes of sapphire from GT Advanced. While debate continues on whether enough of the exceptionally strong/scratch-resistant material will be produced in the near-term to replace traditional iPhone/iPad display cover glasses (such as Gorilla Glass), it's widely expected to do so over the long haul.

2213,Report argues iPhone 5S uses Liquidmetal,"Nov. 7, 2013, 1:00 PM","

After analyzing newly-published European Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) patents, Patently Apple believes the iPhone 5S makes use of Liquidmetal (OTCQB:LQMT).
The site points out he patents describe the use of a metal alloy for a hardware assembly resembling current iPhones, and that drawings spell out ""the process of using Liquidmetal for the current iPhone with its classic metal bezel antenna.""
Patently Apple also thinks a patent diagram suggests Liquidmetal could be used in a future iPad Smart Cover featuring a large window through which users can see the display.

BGR predicted the 5S will make use of Liquidmetal in July. Liquidmetal shares have generally been trading in a narrow range over the last few months, after taking off in response to BGR's report.

2214,"Apple roundup: 12.9"" iPad, Air margins, Deutsche's checks, sapphire","Nov. 5, 2013, 12:47 PM","

Chinese site PadNews has joined a growing list of sources (previous) reporting a bigger iPad (AAPL -0.3%) is on the way. The site reports (translation) Foxconn is testing a 12.9"" iPad, and that the tablet will launch in March '14.
The fact Apple chose to name its 5th-gen 9.7"" iPad the iPad Air has already fueled speculation a larger ""iPad Pro"" is on tap.
After tearing down the 4G and Wi-Fi-only iPad Air units, IHS thinks the tablets carry higher margins than older iPads did at launch time. IHS estimates the cheapest Air model (16GB Wi-Fi-only, sells for $499) costs $274 to make, and thus has a 45% gross margin. The most costly model (128GB 4G, sells for $929) is believed to cost $361 to make, giving it a 61% gross margin. For reference, Apple is guiding for a total Dec. quarter gross margin of 36.5%-37.5%.

Deutsche's checks indicate channel supplies for the Air are healthy, save for the 128GB model; stronger demand for high-capacity models boosts margins/ASPs. The firm also reports iPhone 5S demand is outpacing supply in all of its carrier, online, and retail checks. Lead times remain high for gold 5S units.

Speculation is swirling about what Apple plans to do with the sapphire GT Advanced will be producing for the company at a Mesa, AZ plant to be built by Apple. Those who think the material will be used to cover iPhone/iPad displays point to the fact Apple has mulled using sapphire for this purpose before, but held off because the material couldn't be produced in sufficient volumes. Others think sapphire will only be used in an iWatch for now, given its high costs and the huge volumes needed to handle iPhone/iPad production needs.

2215,Windows Phone's EU5 share keeps rising; mixed data for the iPhone,"Nov. 4, 2013, 6:02 PM","
 Aided by strong sales of the low-end Lumia 520, Windows Phone's (NASDAQ:MSFT) smartphone share in the EU5 rose to 9.8% in the July-September timeframe, per Kantar Worldpanel's latest estimates.That's up from 9.2% in the June-August timeframe, and just 4.6% a year ago. Moreover, Microsoft's OS now claims a double-digit share of U.K., French, and Italian smartphone sales. Elsewhere, progress is slower. Kantar estimates WP still only has a 4.6% share in the U.S. (+190 bps Y/Y), a 2.5% share in China, and a 5.8% share in Latin America. Nokia's most recent Lumia launches could provide a lift. In what has been a general trend this year, the iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) picked up share in the U.S. (+130 bps to 35.9%), and lost share in the EU5 (-230 bps to 14.6%). Also, the iPhone's Chinese share is believed to have fallen 640 bps Y/Y to 13.8%, and its Latin American share is believed to have risen 220 bps to 6.6%. Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) is assigned a U.S. share of 57.3%, an EU5 share of 71.9% (+420 bps), a Chinese share of 81.1% (+1460 bps), and a Latin American share of 73.4% (+2310 bps, largely at BlackBerry/Symbian's expense). Kantar makes note of the price-sensitivity of Chinese consumers, observing some spend 70% of their monthly income to buy a new smartphone. That, in turn, leads many of them to opt for hardware from local brands who are increasingly offering Android phones with high-end specs and mid-range prices.  ",,,
2216,Apple strikes sapphire furnace/supply deal with GT Advanced,"Nov. 4, 2013, 4:41 PM","

The deal, announced within GT Advanced's (GTAT) Q3 report, calls on GT to supply Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with sapphire via furnaces the former company will own/operate at an Arizona facility owned by the latter.
GT plans to employ 700+ people at the facility, and Apple will be providing GT with a $578M prepayment to assist with the efforts. GT will reimburse Apple for the prepayment over five years, starting in 2015.
The magnitude of the initiative suggests Apple plans to use sapphire cover glass to protect the displays used in future iOS hardware (perhaps including 2014 iPhones/iPads). Rumors about such a move have been around for a while, heightened by Apple's use of sapphire to protect iPhone camera lenses and the iPhone 5S' home button.
Assuming Apple uses GT's sapphire with iOS hardware displays, the deal is a negative for Gorilla Glass supplier Corning (NYSE:GLW), particularly since it could encourage other mobile OEMs to embrace sapphire and improve its economies of scale. Sapphire is thinner, stronger, and more scratch-resistant than current cover glass solutions such as Gorilla Glass, but is also much costlier.
On account of the Apple deal, GT has ""accelerated the development of its next generation, large capacity ASF furnaces."" The company expects these efforts to aid its efforts to offer next-gen furnaces to traditional customers in other market segments (LEDs, industrial manufacturing, etc.).

Update: Arizona's governor's office announces Apple will be building a new facility in Mesa, AZ. 1.3K construction jobs will be created to go with GT's 700+ manufacturing jobs. Corning is now down 1.2% AH.

Mobile ad services firm Fiksu, which monitors activity on millions of iOS devices via the apps developed by its clients, reports the iPad Air (AAPL +1.3%) ""is seeing five times the usage the iPad 4 did two days after launch ??and more than 3 times that of the iPad Mini.""
Also: AT&T reports its weekend iPad activations were up over 3x from last year's launch weekend. Though a positive datapoint, it's worth noting Wi-Fi-only devices still make up a solid majority of iPad sales, and that AT&T's tablet subscriber adds have grown quickly this year thanks to the adoption of its Mobile Share plans, which lower the incremental cost of adding a tablet to a service plan.
The retina iPad Mini is set to launch later this month, possibly on Nov. 21.

Gene Munster spotted about 365 people in a line outside Apple's (AAPL -1.2%) flagship NYC store this morning to buy the iPad Air. That's less than the 580 spotted a year ago when the 4th-gen iPad and iPad Mini launched, but better than the Apple perma-bull feared.
Given the Mini and the 3rd-gen iPad each saw opening weekend sales of 3M while dealing with inventory constraints, Munster thinks weekend Air sales could be in the 2.5M-3.5M range, with sell-through of 1M-2M and channel fill of 1.5M.
Much as it has done with the iPhone 5C, Wal-mart is discounting the 16Gb Wi-Fi-only Air below its official retail price; the retail giant is selling the tablet for $479. Interestingly, Apple has joined Best Buy and Staples in matching Wal-mart's price cut.
The Air is launching to very good reviews, but (like the retina Mini) its pricing relative to comparable Android hardware has been criticized.

2221,"First iPad Air reviews solid, Apple sets $11B FY14 capex budget","Oct. 31, 2013, 12:42 AM","

""If you can afford it, the new iPad Air is the tablet I recommend, hands down,"" says Walt Mossberg after reviewing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5th-gen 9.7"" tablet. Mossberg deems the thinner/lighter Air much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time than its predecessor, and managed to wring out 12+ hours of battery life in his test (20% above a promised 10 hours).

CNET (4.5/5 stars) talks up the Air's design makeover, its improved front camera, and the ""ridiculously fast"" performance of its A7 CPU. But it wishes the tablet had an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio and a fingerprint sensor.
After running benchmarks, AnandTech finds the Air's CPU performance beats that of rival Android hardware. GPU performance is also strong, but not as overwhelmingly; Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Shield handheld console (features a Tegra 4 processor) topped several benchmarks.
With prices well above those for comparable Android tablets (particularly for 32GB-64GB models), Apple is betting its hardware quality, brand loyalty, and unmatched tablet app ecosystem will allow it to once more post positive Y/Y iPad revenue growth following two quarters of declines.
Meanwhile, Apple has released its FY13 10-K, and used it to disclose an FY14 capex budget of $11B. That's 57% higher than the $7B budget created for FY13, and equal to 6% of estimated FY14 revenue.

IDC estimates 47.6M tablets were shipped in Q3, +7% Q/Q and +36.7% Y/Y. The Y/Y growth rate represents a major slowdown from Q2's 60% (never mind Q1's 142%), and is? below JPMorgan's forecast for 54% growth. It also puts IDC's September forecast for 227.4M 2013 shipments (+58% Y/Y) in doubt.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which just reported 14.1M Sep. quarter iPad shipments, is assigned a 29.6% share, down from 40.2% a year earlier. In July, IDC gave Apple a 32.4% Q2 share, down all the way from 60.3% a year earlier.
A pending iPad refresh played a role in the decline - IDC expects ""robust"" iPad shipment growth in Q4 - but an industry mix shift towards cheap ~7"" Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) tablets (many of them from white-label OEMs) was also a major factor.
Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) is believed to have shipped 9.7M tablets, good for a 20.4% share (+800 bps Y/Y). IDC thinks Nexus 7 OEM Asus shipped 3.5M tablets and held a 7.4% share, and that Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) shipped 2.3M tablets and held a 4.8% share.
IDC's numbers come two days after Strategy Analytics estimated smartphone shipments rose 45% Y/Y in Q3 to 251M. The two sets of figures suggest the smartphone market was 5.3x as large as the tablet market on a unit basis. That ratio will probably narrow in Q4, given the iPad refresh and the popularity of tablets as Christmas presents.

Ahead of this afternoon's FQ4 report, the ever-bullish Brian White has raised his FQ4 Apple (AAPL) revenue and EPS estimates to $37.5B and $8.06, above a consensus of $36.8B and $7.93. Likewise, his FQ1 estimates have been raised to $58.9B and $14.50, above a consensus of $55.7B and $13.86.
Meanwhile, Localytics (previous) now reports the iPhone 5S and 5C respectively make up 3.8% and 1.7% of the global iPhone base. The iPhone 5 is said to to make up 39.8%, the 4S 32.9%, and the iPhone 4 20.2%.
In Japan, where NTT DoCoMo just began carrying the iPhone, the 5S/5C already make up nearly 10% of the local iPhone base. In the U.S., the figure is 6.4%.
Three things that stand to receive scrutiny this afternoon: 1) Details about 5S supply constraints; though supplies have improved, Apple's U.S. online store still shows 5S shipping times of 2-3 weeks. 2) Gross margin figures, which are likely getting a boost from healthy 5S sales and Apple's decision to maintain premium pricing. 3) Commentary about sales trends in Europe and emerging markets (inc. China), where Apple has lost share this year thanks to the rising popularity of cheaper and larger smartphones.

2231,Qualcomm reassigns marketing chief following critical Apple CPU remark,"Oct. 26, 2013, 2:00 PM","

Anand Chandrasekher, Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) chief marketing officer and once the head of Intel's Atom CPU unit, has been reassigned after calling the 64-bit ARMv8 (NASDAQ:ARMH) instruction set used by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new A7 CPU (found in the iPhone 5S, iPad Air, and retina iPad Mini) a ""gimmick.""
Qualcomm, which had already declared the comments to be ""inaccurate"" in an attempt at damage control, says Chandrasekher is ""moving to a new role leading our exploration of certain enterprise related initiatives.""
Back in August, Chandrasekher drew headlines by declaring 8-core mobile processors, such as one launched by MediaTek, a ""dumb"" idea, given efficiency/battery life tradeoffs. But whereas MediaTek is a rival, Apple is one of Qualcomm's top clients, using its baseband modems, RF transceivers, and power management ICs (but not its app processors) in iPhones and 4G-capable iPads.
PR concerns aside, most apps won't get a performance boost from 64-bit in the near-term. But ARMv8's support for more CPU registers will benefit some performance-intensive media apps. Long-term, the ability of 64-bit CPUs to support more than 4GB of RAM make their mobile adoption inevitable.
ARM shares took off after Apple disclosed the A7 will feature ARMv8, since 64-bit CPUs carry higher royalties. Since then, Samsung has disclosed its next-gen CPUs will be 64-bit.

2236,Apple outperforms as sell-side gives thumbs-up to new iPads,"Oct. 23, 2013, 12:58 PM","

Goldman's Bill Shope (Buy, $560 PT) is nudging his FY14 Apple (AAPL +0.8%) estimates higher following yesterday's iPad launches (I, II),? arguing the quality of the iPad Air and the retina Mini's price points should yield higher iPad ASPs and unit shipments.
Thanks to a mix shift towards the Mini, Apple's iPad ASP has been trending lower, and was at $437 in the June quarter.
Meanwhile, Lazard's Ed Parker is pleased with the huge incremental margins Apple continues to see on higher-capacity hardware, as well as its willingness to provide free software to get consumers to buy.
Though NAND flash prices have fallen plenty over the last three years, Apple still charges $100 more for a 32GB iPad than a similar 16GB iPad, and another $100 more for a similar 64GB model. Google and Amazon only charge $40 more for 32GB versions of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX. Another $40 gets Amazon customers a 64GB HDX.
Not everyone buys into the wisdom of Apple's pricing strategy, which follows a Q2 for which IDC estimated the company's tablet unit share fell to 32.4% from 60.3% a year earlier.

Troy Wolverton: ""You know things are out of whack when the best-priced iPad still costs $500 and Apple is offering a 2-1/2 year old model at a price that is $40 more expensive than a comparably sized -- but brand new -- Samsung tablet.""

Apple plans to charge a relatively steep $399 for the 16GB Wi-Fi-only retina Mini; Google's 2nd-gen Nexus 7 and Amazon's 7"" Kindle Fire HDX, both of which also have high-res displays, start at $229.
The first-gen Mini's starting price has been cut to $299 from $329. That still leaves it priced well above the $200-and-cheaper 7"" Android devices that have taken a large chunk of the tablet market.
Like the iPad Air, the retina Mini begins shipping on Nov. 1. No fingerprint sensor was disclosed for either device.
New iPad Smart Covers ($39) and full-wrap covers ($79) have been shown off, but the rumored keyboard cover hasn't. Logitech (LOGI +1.2%) has ticked higher in response.

The 5th-gen iPad (AAPL - unchanged) has been unveiled; Apple is calling it the iPad Air. The device is 20% thinner than its predecessor, and ~30% lighter (it weighs 1 pound).
As rumored, the Air has thinner (iPad Mini-like) bezels, and contains Apple's 64-bit A7 CPU and M7 motion co-processor (both are found in the iPhone 5S). Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life (same as the 4th-gen iPad).
Pricing is unchanged relative to 4th-gen models: a 16GB Wi-Fi-only Air goes for $499. The tablet ships on Nov. 1. The iPad 2 is being kept around, and without price cuts (it starts at $399).
Cumulative iPad sales have passed 170M, and over 475K of the App Store's 1M apps have been optimized for the iPad. There were 375K iPad-specific apps in June.
Also: Apple has updated its iLife media apps - iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand - as well as its iWork productivity suite. The iLife apps have joined iWork (previous) in being free to buyers of new iOS hardware. Between the free iOS apps and Mavericks, Apple is now clearly content to give away software to drive hardware sales.

Aided by Haswell, the new 13"" Pro is said to provide up to 9 hours of battery life, and the 15"" Pro up to 8 hours. The 13"" model uses an integrated Intel Iris GPU, while the 15"" model can come with either an Iris Pro GPU or a discrete Nvidia (NVDA -0.8%) GeForce 750M GPU.
Also launched: the new Mac Pro, which was first discussed at WWDC.

Easier comps helped out a bit (shipments fell 8.6% Y/Y a year ago), as did ""channel intake of Windows 8.1-based systems"" in September. (PR)
As was the case in Q2, U.S. and enterprise were areas of strength. U.S. shipments only fell 0.2%, and enterprise volumes saw a ""slight uptick."" But tablet cannibalization led Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) shipments to fall 8.8%. EMEA declined in-line with expectations, while Japan outperformed.
The mix shift is a positive for H-P (HPQ - 27% U.S. share vs. 17.1% global share), Intel (INTC - higher ASPs), and Microsoft (MSFT - higher ASPs and less piracy). It hurts Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), but the Chinese firm was still the market's top vendor, and saw its global share rise 160 bps Y/Y to 17.3%.
H-P was #2; its share rose 130 bps. #3 Dell, which has gotten more aggressive with its pricing, saw its share rise 90 bps to 11.7%.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) U.S. PC share, which has been rising in recent years, fell 140 bps to 11.6%; the enterprise mix shift and pending MacBook Pro/Mac OS X refreshes likely played roles.
Other affected industry names: AMD, NVDA, MU, STX, WDC.

The White House has refused to grant Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) a veto on an ITC import ban on older smartphones deemed to be infringing Apple (AAPL -0.5%) patents related to swiping/scrolling gestures and headset detection. The decision comes two months after a ban on older iPhones/iPads ruled to be infringing a Samsung 3G patent was vetoed.
While critics might allege the differing rulings smack of hometown favoritism, the White House is likely to argue its stance is the due to the fact the Apple patents weren't standards-essential, and the Samsung patent was. The use of standards-essential IP in patent suits has turned into a hot-button political issue.
Regardless, the ban doesn't cover Samsung's latest phones, such as the Galaxy S4, S4 Mini, and Note 3, and is unlikely to have a big impact on the electronics giant's U.S. sales.

Though Peter Misek's upgrade got the most attention, Apple (AAPL +0.9%) received several other bullish sell-side notes today as well, helping shares outperform the Nasdaq by ~2%.
Cowen's Tim Arcuri, who made an Asian trip of his own, thinks Street iPhone estimates are conservative in spite of supply constraints. Arcuri sees 36M and 56M Sep. quarter and Dec. quarter shipments, respectively.
Meanwhile, Brian White says his Apple Barometer (monitors the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) saw a 9%-10% M/M increase for September. That's better than 2012's 3%, though a little below an 8-year average of 11%.
More on Misek's upgrade: The Jefferies analyst sees the iPhone 6 having a 4.8"" display, and expects the device will help Apple take back share from Android. He also thinks Apple's suppliers ""have become far more lenient on price.""

Canaccord's Mike Walkley says his Sep. iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) survey data points to very strong early 5S/5C sales in both the U.S. and international markets; a large base of upgrade-eligible 4S users is likely helping. Likewise, Evercore's Rob Chira is raising his FQ4 (Dec. quarter) iPhone sales forecast to 56M from 54M, citing good momentum.
BMO's Keith Bachman offers a more guarded take. A U.S./U.K./German survey turned up muted enthusiasm for the latest iPhones, and found respondents assigning only ""modest value"" to relying on the same brand across multiple device types. Also, Bachman thinks (like Ming-Chi Kuo and Peter Misek) 5C inventory-building had much to do with Apple's 9M launch weekend iPhone sales.
Bachmann is lowering his Apple revenue and unit sales estimates, but is also raising his EPS and margin forecasts due to a higher-than-expected price for the 5C. His PT has been raised to $508 from $480.

comScore joins Kantar in reporting the iPhone picked up some more U.S. share ahead of the 5S/5C launches. The firm estimates 40.7% of U.S. smartphone users relied on an iPhone in the June-August timeframe, up from 40.4% for May-July and 39.2% from March-May.

 In spite of limited early 5S supplies due to fingerprint sensor issues, Gene Munster says checks at 60 Apple Stores (AAPL -0.1%) indicate at least one grey model was available at nearly every store. That's better than the situation a year ago, when the iPhone 5 was almost impossible to find. A spreadsheet from BTIG's Walter Piecyk provides mixed data on 5S availability. While AT&T and Verizon are indicating long shipment times for gold models, AT&T has 32GB and 64GB grey/silver models available, and 7-14-day shipping times for the 16GB versions. Verizon's times for grey/silver models range from 11-32 days, and Apple's online store only promises to ship ordered iPhones somewhere in October.

Cue, which recently announced it's shutting down its app, relied on a user's e-mails and social networking info to push time/location-sensitive notifications. Google Now does something similar while relying on Gmail, search, Maps, and other Google services.
Google is fresh off updating its iOS search app to send Android-like push notifications. Apple, meanwhile, has updated its iOS Notification Center (via iOS 7) to provide time-sensitive updates (among other things).

The Verge's Vlad Savov gives Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) $299 Galaxy Gear smartwatch a score of just 4.0/10. He likes the device's display, voice calling abilities, and camera, but not much else. The Gear is deemed too dependent on paired smartphones, and its battery life (one day under normal use) too short. In addition, its notifications are called ""uninformative;"" and its apps ""buggy or substandard.""
Savov: ""A smartwatch the Galaxy Gear is not. Frankly, I?™m not sure exactly what it?™s supposed to be.""
Engadget's Brad Molen is a little more positive. He calls the Gear comfortable to wear and its performance adequate, but is just as critical of its notifications, and doesn't like the lack of touchless controls. ""The Galaxy Gear is a solid effort from Samsung, but it needs time to grow and develop."" AnandTech's Brian Klug reaches a similar conclusion.

A year after Apple (AAPL +0.2%) launched new iMacs featuring an overhauled, ultra-thin design to much fanfare, the company has more quietly refreshed the internals of its all-in-one desktops.
Apple's new 21.5"" and 27"" iMacs contain quad-core Intel Haswell CPUs (Core i5 and i7, 2.7GHz.-3.4GHz.), and 3 of the 4 feature Nvidia (NVDA -0.2%) GeForce 700 series GPUs (Apple promises a ~40% GPU performance gain). 802.11ac Wi-Fi radios and improved flash memory and Fusion Drive performance are also part of the package.
The new iMacs are priced from $1,299-$1,999. Apple's Mac revenue fell 1% Y/Y in the June quarter to $4.9B (better than the PC industry's performance). Units fell 7% to to 3.75M.
Meanwhile, after tearing the devices down, IHS estimates a 16GB iPhone 5S (unsubsidized price of $649) has a manufacturing cost of $199, and a 16GB 5C ($549 unsubsidized) a cost of $173.
The research firm points out Apple puts more effort into RF chip integration than rivals. ""Where other phone companies would be using whatever chips its various vendors sell off-the-shelf, Apple seems to be pushing its RF suppliers to do things they don?™t do for anyone else.""
IHS thinks it only costs Apple $10 more to make a 32GB 5S than a 16GB 5S, and $19 more to make a 64GB 5S. Thus, the $100 and $200 markups for the 32GB and 64GB models are respectively estimated to carry incremental margins of 90% and 90.5%.

BMO's Keith Bachman hit the malls to find longer lines than last year's iPhone 5 launch, but writes this off as having to do with no pre-orders for the 5S. 5C sales look like a disappointment even to his already-muted expectations for that unit.?The gold 5S is a hit, but little supply exists, with one visited store running out in the first 30 minutes.

A new Apple TV set-top is reportedly due later this year.
A Chipworks analysis indicates the 5S' A7 CPU is made by Samsung rather than TSMC (TSM -1.4%). There had been reports Apple would tap TSMC to make the A7. However, the WSJ has reported TSMC would only start mass-production of Apple CPUs in 2014, while leveraging its next-gen 20nm process.
Chipworks also reports NXP (NXPI +1.6%) is manufacturing the 5S' M7 motion co-processor. Apple promises the M7 will improve battery life (by offloading tasks from the A7) and (by constantly recording movements) will enable new health, fitness, gaming, and mapping apps/services.

This morning, the Web/mobile radio leader announced underwriters have fully exercised the 2.73M-share overallotment option provided with the company's 18.2M-share stock offering (priced yesterday). That means the offering now stands to yield gross proceeds of $393M, and increase Pandora's diluted share count by 9%.

Initial takes on iTunes Radio (AAPL - became available on Wednesday, as part of iOS 7) have mostly been positive. Users like the service's music algorithms, History and Wish List features, and station-customizing tools, as well as a Featured Stations option that CNET (4.5/5 stars) thinks ""[blends] the personal touch of a curated list with the scale and smarts of an underlying algorithm.""
CNET also praises the larger size of iTunes Radio's library (27M tracks to Pandora's 1M), ability to leverage iTunes playback/purchase data, and ""minimally intrusive ads."" Billboard (2.5/4), however, is critical of iTunes Radio's Siri integration (unable to handle some basic commands) and the reliability of its syncing features.
Still working in Pandora's favor: the time invested by its 72M+ active users in creating custom stations, and the ability to support users looking to listen on both iOS and Android hardware.

The Chinese figures come amidst sharp criticism of the 5C's unsubsidized pricing, which starts at $735 in China. For reference, upstart Xiaomi's new Mi3 flagship Android phone (5"" 1080p display, 13MP camera) starts at $327 in the Middle Kingdom.

Two of Apple's staunchest sell-side defenders, Brian White and Gene Munster, sprung into action again today. Echoing Misek's comments about 5S fingerprint sensor production issues - Digitimes and KGI reported about this in August - White admitted the ""complexity"" of the 5S is hampering production. But he added the unchanged 5C delivery times are simply due to healthy supply (the result of a ""relatively straightforward"" manufacturing process).
Munster's analysis of ""U.S. consumer sentiment"" for Apple's latest iPhones, as measured by Twitter commentary, indicates 69% and 67% of comments were respectively positive for the 5S and 5C two days after the launch event. That compares with 67% for the iPhone 5 last year. Of course, a major gap has opened up between the iPhone's market share in the U.S. and many other big markets.

Though being discontinued elsewhere, the iPhone 4 is still available in China for RMB2,588 ($420) for the time being.
For now, Apple isn't giving 3rd-party developers access to its fingerprint sensor API. Odds are that will change down the line.

AnandTech offers a favorable take on the sensor after trying it out ""Tapping and holding your finger on the button quickly unlocks the device.""

Among other things, OS chief Craig Federighi talks up iOS 7's easier search menu access, improved multitasking tools, and new camera app features. He also notes Siri has been revamped (among other things, it can now be used to search Twitter), and officially announces the launch of iTunes Radilo. Pandora (P -1.4%) shares are ticking lower.
iOS 7 will be available to iPhone 5 and 4S users, as well as iPad Mini and 3rd and 4th-gen iPad users on Sep. 18. iPad 2 and iPhone 4 support will arrive later.
Also: Tim Cook has announced Apple's iWork productivity suite will now be provided for free with any new iOS device. That could go over well with enterprise buyers.

2313,"Apple roundup: 5S fingerprint sensor confirmed, big marketing push on tap?","Sep. 10, 2013, 12:16 PM","

Ahead of today's 1PM ET iPhone event (live blog), the WSJ has confirmed the iPhone 5S will include a fingerprint sensor. However, the cheaper 5C isn't expected to have one.

AdAge reports Apple (AAPL -0.8%) is ""significantly expanding"" its internal ad design/marketing team. One exec thinks its ranks could grow to 500-600 from a current 300. In June, Apple released a high-profile TV ad that was likened to a manifesto.
Analysts have been tripping over themselves to predict the impact of the 5C and the reportedly pending China Mobile and NTT DoCoMo deals. FBN (Outperform) thinks adding China Mobile could boost calendar 2014 EPS by $2, assuming a relatively low ASP ($425) and gross margin (30%). The firm observes Apple was estimated by Strategy Analytics to have only a 4.3% share of the Chinese smartphone market in Q2.
Deutsche's Brian Whitmore is more bullish, estimating China Mobile and DoCoMo could drive 35M extra iPhone sales in 2014, and lift EPS by $5. He observes ~35M China Mobile subs already use ""gray market"" iPhones, and thinks most will upgrade if given a chance to buy subsidized hardware.
Citi's Glen Yeung remains cautious, arguing the 5C's ability to take share could be limited by the fact $400+ phones only accounted for 13.7% of the Q2 smartphone market (per Gartner), and estimating every ""5% move in mix"" from the 5S to the 5C will affect gross margin by 315 bps and EPS by 2.1%.

2314,Apple set to unveil two new iPhones,"Sep. 10, 2013, 2:56 AM","
 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to hold a press event in California today, when it is expected to unveil a new high-end iPhone that could contain a fingerprint scanner and longer battery life, and a lower-cost version of the handset. Apple could also release a revamp of its iOS software that will include iTunes radio. However, Apple won't announce a deal with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), the world's largest cellular carrier, Bloomberg reports. While the cheaper iPhone could increase share in emerging markets, Benedict Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis, says it may not be a major profit driver. There's also the danger that it could damage Apple's reputation as a premium brand. In India, where Apple's volumes are low, the company has not followed Samsung's lead in increasing prices despite the plunge in the rupee this year. The ""strategy could pay off if stable prices lure new buyers,"" says IDC's Kiranjeet Kaur, although others aren't so convinced.  ",,,

With PC's now in ""protect"" mode, the ""attack"" part of Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) CEO Yang Yuanqing's ""Protect and Attack"" strategy has shifted to tablets and smartphones.?Yang has reorganized the company to address ""attack markets"" head-on, and believes even gorillas Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung?(OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) aren't invincible.
""We know the playbook; we've done it on PCs,"" says Gerry Smith who has seen it up close as a former Dell exec, and now heads Lenovo's Americas group. ""We can attack on scale. We'll attack on cost efficiency and speed. We can attack these guys from the bottom, and put a lot of pressure on them from a product portfolio, pricing, time-to-market perspective.""
Lenovo produced 11.4M smartphones and 1.5M tablets in FQ1, a triple and a quadruple, respectively, from a year earlier. The company this week launched a new flagship premium phone, the Vibe X, and plans a number of other new products before year's end.
""What P/E would investors pay for a 'Chinese Apple,'"" asks bullish portfolio manager James Weir. He notes the company continues to gain market share in flat PC markets, but the potential for ""rerating"" is in mobile. ""If Lenovo can keep growing this, they can earn the right to be rated with Apple and Samsung as a sexy consumer electronics player, not just a PC box seller.""

SA Pro's Stephen Simpson is of a similar mind about Lenovo's opportunity in mobile.

The paper adds Apple (AAPL +0.8%) has asked Foxconn to add China Mobile (CHL +1%) to the list of carriers receiving the iPhone 5C. A deal between Apple and the world's largest carrier has been increasingly expected following recent talks, comments, and event announcements.It isn't clear from the report whether Apple will also be shipping CHL the iPhone 5S or 5.Multiple reports emerged yesterday that Apple is also set to begin selling the iPhone to NTT DoCoMo, Meanwhile, Bloomberg observed China Mobile is believed to be driving a hard bargain with Apple. DoCoMo (60M+ high-ARPU subs) and CHL (740M+ subs, but a much lower ARPU) have easily been the largest/most lucrative carriers not to carry the iPhone.There have also been reports over the last two days that China Unicom and Telecom will begin selling the iPhone later this month. But China Mobile sales could take longer to start, due to the need for regulators to vet an iPhone supporting the carrier's TD-LTE 4G network. ",,,
2318,"Apple roundup: e-book injunction, Chinese 5S/5C sales starting in Sep.","Sep. 6, 2013, 10:58 AM","

Two months after U.S. district judge Denise Cote declared Apple (AAPL +0.2%) guilty of conspiring to fix e-book prices, and two weeks after the DOJ proposed e-book injunction terms, Cote has issued an injunction.
As suggested by the DOJ, Apple is prohibited from striking restrictive e-book pricing deals with publishers for 5 years, and is required to stagger its talks with publishers to prevent collusion. Also, an external monitor has been assigned for two years.
However, Apple won't be required to allow rivals to sell e-books through their iOS apps without giving Apple a 30% cut, as the DOJ had suggested. Amazon (AMZN +0.4%) has refused to sell e-books through its Kindle iOS apps out of an unwillingness to pay Apple 30% of its take.
Meanwhile, Reuters nearly backs up yesterday's Sina Tech report by reporting China Unicom (CHU -0.3%) and Telecom (CHA -0.6%) will begin selling the iPhone 5S/5C shortly after it goes on sale in the U.S., a major change of pace from the delays accompanying past Chinese iPhone launches.
Other news: Apple Insider reports Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) will be released at the end of October, and Quantcast and Piper estimate iOS' share of U.S. mobile browsing traffic has grown to 65%.
The latter is a negative for Google (GOOG +0.2%), due to the huge traffic acquisition payments it makes to Apple for Mobile Safari search ad clicks. However, Google doesn't have to pay Apple if iOS users rely on Chrome, as a growing portion of them are.

It's a busy day for the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill. The WSJ now reports the company ""has begun evaluating a plan to offer iPhones with screens ranging from 4.8 inches to as high as six inches."" Moreover, sources state Apple's ""internal deliberations and plans indicate it appears more willing to move ahead than in years past.""
The paper reported in July Apple had ordered display prototypes for 4""+ iPhones and a ~13"" iPad, and Reuters reported in June Apple is thinking of selling 4.7"" and 5.7"" iPhones.
While Apple reportedly evaluates, phablet demand is soaring, particularly in Asia. IDC estimates phablet sales doubled Q/Q and rose 620% Y/Y in Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) in Q2, to 25.2M units (nearly even with regional notebook and tablet sales combined).
The popularity of large-screen phones, together with strong demand for low-end Android phones in emerging markets, has contributed to the iPhone's recent share losses in Europe and (outside of Japan) Asia.

Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3 (5.7"" 1080p display) yesterday.
The upcoming iPhone 5S and 5C are both expected to sport 4"" displays.

If the Chinese media report (comes from local site Sina Tech - translation)? pans out, it means China Telecom (CHA +0.4%) and China Unicom (CHU -0.3%) will start selling Apple's (AAPL -0.8%) newest iPhones the same day they're expected to launch in the U.S. and several other big international markets.
Last year, Telecom and Unicom didn't begin selling the iPhone 5 until Dec. 14, more than 2 months after the device went on sale in dozens of other markets.
Sina Tech also reports China Mobile (CHL +0.7%) won't be able to sell the 5S until November (assuming a deal is announced), due to the need for regulatory approval of an iPhone supporting CHL's TD-LTE 4G network.
The 5S is said to come in 4 colors, and the plastic-shell 5C in 5 colors. Other reports suggest the 5S' colors will be white, black, gold, and graphite, and the 5C's colors white, red, green, blue, and yellow.

The Japanese paper says DoCoMo (DCM +1.1%) is likely to announce a partnership with Apple (AAPL -0.8%) on the day of its iPhone launch. Apple has announced an iPhone satellite event will take place in Tokyo (along with ones in Beijing and Berlin) hours after its main Sep. 10 event in Cupertino.
A DoCoMo EVP suggested last month a deal could be close. Previous talks between Apple and DoCoMo reportedly faltered due to Apple's purchase requirements and DoCoMo's insistence on pre-installing some of its apps.
DoCoMo, by far Japan's largest carrier (60M+ subs, 1/4 of which are now using 4G phones), has been losing share to SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF) and KDDI in large part due to its failure to carry the iPhone. Though DoCoMo's sub base is much smaller than China Mobile's 740M, a much larger portion of it can afford a $450+ (unsubsidized) phone.
Japan is the iPhone's strongest major international market. Thanks largely to iPhone sales, Apple's Japanese revenue rose 27% Y/Y in FQ3 to $2.5B, even as revenue fell 14% in Greater China and 18% in the rest of Asia-Pac.

Update: Bloomberg reports Apple is ""near a final agreement"" with DoCoMo, and that the carrier ""may begin offering the iPhone later this year.""

CHL's ability to post decent 3G sub growth in spite of lacking the iPhone has arguably given it more leverage. Bloomberg's column comes amidst speculation a Beijing iPhone satellite event could include a CHL announcement.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo now thinks a retina iPad Mini will launch by the end of 2013 (along with a 5th-gen regular iPad). That's in-line with an Aug. Bloomberg report.
Kuo also believes a new non-retina Mini will launch in early '14 to take on cheap Android tablets that have been rapidly gaining share (particularly in emerging markets), and that both the retina Mini and 5th-gen iPad will use a new A7X CPU (the 4th-gen iPad uses the A6X).

IHS thinks Apple may need to acquire a DRAM/NAND flash memory manufacturer, to secure supply, develop custom parts (something suppliers have been reluctant to do for Apple), and match Samsung's level of vertical integration.

Milunovich, who is also raising his FY14 and FY15 EPS estimates, predicts CHL will sell 17M iPhones in Apple's FY14 (with the much-rumored iPhone 5C accounting for 70% of them), and in doing so boost Apple's EPS by $3.25 (each additional 1M units are estimated to add $0.20).
He thinks the 5C will carry an unsubsidized price of $399; KGI Securities recently predicted a $400-$500 price.
Yesterday, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, never shy to make optimistic Apple forecasts, predicted the 5C could boost Apple's Chinese smartphone share by 1300-1900 bps (the exact amount depending on a CHL deal), even at a ""pricing sweet spot"" of $486. Some of that share will probably have to be taken from sub-$250 Android phones; Chinese demand for them has skyrocketed.

2374,9to5 Mac: Mansfield's role at Apple reduced at his request,"Aug. 2, 2013, 6:39 PM","


Sources tell 9to5 Mac former engineering chief Bob Mansfield departed from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) executive team out of a desire to focus on chip design and future products (such as the iWatch?).
Mansfield's other responsibilities are being split between hardware SVP Dan Riccio (designated as Mansfield's successor before he came out of retirement) and operations SVP Jeff Williams.
9to5 observes delegating some of Mansfield's responsibilities to Riccio means all iPhone/iPad engineering will be ""under one roof"" instead of being split between multiple teams.
Sources claims Mansfield would still like to retire, albeit while continuing to ""contribute to Apple in some fashion.""

2375,DOJ proposes e-book remedies for Apple case,"Aug. 2, 2013, 10:50 AM","


The DOJ wants Apple (AAPL +0.3%) to terminate its existing deals with five top book publishers, and to ""refrain for five years from entering new e-book distribution contracts which would restrain Apple from competing on price.""
It also wants Apple to be ""prohibited from again serving as a conduit of information among the conspiring publishers,"" and from entering into content deals that are likely to raise competitor content prices.
In a positive for Amazon (AMZN -0.3%) and Barnes & Noble (BKS -0.1%), the DOJ also proposes Apple allow e-book rivals to ""provide links from their e-book apps to their e-bookstores"" for two years. Such a requirement would give Amazon and B&N a way to sell e-books on iDevices without giving Apple a 30% cut. Amazon has been trying to avoid paying Apple via its Kindle Web apps, but that's an imperfect workaround at best.

Previous: U.S. district judge declares Apple guilty of e-book price-fixing.

2376,WSJ: Apple's search for retail chief going slowly,"Aug. 1, 2013, 6:32 PM","
Sources tell the WSJ Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has interviewed several candidates to be the company's next retail chief, but ""has yet to settle on a final list.""One recruiter claims potential candidates are wary of taking the job because Apple hasn't been clear about its goals.Apple has been without a retail head since John Browett was shown the door last October, leaving Tim Cook in charge of retail on an interim basis. Also, division VP Jerry McDougal left in January.Apple's retail sales were roughly flat Y/Y in FQ3 at $4.07B. The company's total revenue rose 1% to $35.3B. Apple's retail sales per sq. foot, while still the envy of many high-end retailers, is down 4.5% Y/Y thus far in FY13 to $4,542, per consulting firm Customer Growth Partners. ",,,
2377,"Report: Apple buys Bluetooth chipmaker, possibly for iWatch efforts","Aug. 1, 2013, 3:11 PM","

Sources tell ex-WSJ reporter Jessica Lessin Apple (AAPL +0.7%) has acquired Passif Semiconductor, a chipmaker developing radios for the low-power Bluetooth LE (i.e. Bluetooth SMART) standard, which was created with embedded and wearable computing applications in mind.
Two weeks ago, the FT reported Apple is ramping its iWatch design/engineering efforts. Passif's chips are a logical fit for them.
The acquisition is noteworthy for Broadcom (BRCM +0.2%), given the company is the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS combo chip supplier for the iPhone and iPad, and has been developing its own low-power Bluetooth parts.

Pac Crest recently stated there's a growing risk Apple will abandon Broadcom in favor of home-grown combo chips, given Apple's hiring activity and Texas Instruments' $315M sale of wireless connectivity IP to an unnamed OEM (believed by some to be Apple). If Apple wishes to ditch Broadcom, Passif could provide one piece to the puzzle, but only that.

Update: Apple confirms it has bought Passif.

2378,WSJ: Retina iPad Mini production to start in Q4,"Aug. 1, 2013, 9:37 AM","

""Mass production"" of an iPad Mini (AAPL +0.9%) sporting a retina display made by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY), and LG Display (NYSE:LPL) will reportedly start in Q4. No word on whether the device will also launch in the quarter, or in Q1 2014, as others (I, II) have suggested.

9to5 Mac just reported iOS 7 SDK code indicates a non-retina Mini is also on tap. Will Apple offer a non-retina model for less than $300 to take on cheaper, share-gaining, 7"" Android tablets?
Recent reports have also indicated Apple, in spite of its obvious differences with Samsung, plans to continue using the company as a chip foundry partner (along with TSMC), and will rely on it to supply thin LCD glass.
AU Optronics (AUO +3%), which (together with LG Display) supplies LCDs for the current Mini, reportedly won't be a retina Mini supplier.

Developer Hamza Sood has uncovered code that appears to confirm rumors the iPhone 5S' (AAPL +1.8%) home button will have a built-in fingerprint sensor.
Tim Cook reportedly traveled to China this week to meet with China Telecom's (CHA +0.3%) leadership. No details on what was discussed; chances are CHA will be a major buyer of the low-cost iPhone.
In a ""final office action,"" the USPTO has rejected 21 claims within Apple's pinch-to-zoom patent. Look for Apple to appeal the ruling. In June, the USPTO reaffirmed the validity of a claim in Apple's ""rubber-banding"" patent after previously invalidating it.
Leaked photo cases and a BI source indicate the low-cost iPhone will be called the iPhone 5C. ""C"" is meant to stand for ""color,"" though as BI notes, critics could refer to it as standing for ""cheap.""
Sprint sold 1.4M iPhones in Q2, down from 1.5M in Q1 and a year ago. For reference, Verizon sold 3.9M iPhones in Q2, and AT&T at least 3.7M.
The iPhone's U.S. customer loyalty remains strong. A CIRP survey found 78% of U.S. iPhone owners upgrading to a new iPhone vs. 67% of Android owners buying a new Android phone.

2383,Mansfield changes roles at Apple; company probing labor issues,"Jul. 29, 2013, 9:17 AM","

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineering chief Bob Mansfield is no longer on the company's executive team, and instead will work on ""special projects,"" while still reporting to Tim Cook. His bio has disappeared from Apple's executive profiles page.
Mansfield, Apple's long-time hardware engineering head, temporarily announced his retirement last year, only to be lured back (reportedly following employee discontent over his departure) and given a bigger role as part of Tim Cook's Oct. '12 shakeup. A $2M/month salary may have helped convince him.
Former Yves Saint-Laurent CEO Paul Deneve was named a ""special projects"" VP earlier this month. Many speculate he's working on an iWatch.
Separately, Apple says it's sending audit teams to 3 Chinese factories accused by Chinese Labor Watch of having poor working/living conditions.
