 Google (GOOG -1.8%, GOOGL -1.6%) is an unlikely buyer for Zayo Group (NYSE:ZAYO), MoffettNathanson says in response to reports that the tech giant might be a player in new bidding for the network provider. ZAYO shares are up 3% in first regular-session action since the Bloomberg report Friday evening of new interest from the likes of Google and CenturyLink (CTL +0.7%). But Google would probably face regulatory issues in trying to buy Zayo, and in any case has been able to build its network by leasing rather than construction or acquisition, analyst Nick Del Deo says. CenturyLink would be a more logical partner but could also face regulatory concerns along with operational and financial issues.

 Facebook (FB +1.3%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is asserting his control over three distinct messaging services in an ambitious move to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger at a technical level, The New York Times reports. The three services would continue operating as stand-alone apps but would see a unified messaging structure underneath that would allow (for example) a Facebook user to send an encrypted message to a WhatsApp user, which could lead users to stick with texting inside Facebook properties rather than turning to Apple (AAPL +1.5%) or Google (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +0.9%). It might also promise a better chance at making money from (relatively) low-revenue WhatsApp and Instagram, perhaps via new advertising or other fee-based services. The project's in early stages and wouldn't wrap until late this year or early 2020, according to the report. The move is causing some internal turmoil; it's a reversal of Zuckerberg's earlier stance that the acquired companies' products should remain heavily separate, and amid exits from WhatsApp's and Instagram's founders, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Zuckerberg over the new integration plan on internal message boards and at a December staff meeting, the NYT says.

It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary.""

Are there cases we lose? Absolutely."" Asked how closely the department looks in particular at platforms that touch multiple aspects of people's lives, like Amazon.com (AMZN +1%), Facebook (FB +1.3%) and Alphabet (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%), he replies ""We're just there to police the markets.

 Ad industry giants that first benefited from the Internet's rise now face existential threats from the disruption, as campaign innovation threatens their bread and butter, WSJ's Stephen Wilmot says. Traditional creative campaigns from the likes of WPP (WPP +1.6%), Omnicom (NYSE:OMC), Interpublic Group (IPG -0.8%) and Publicis Groupe (PUBGY +0.4%) are facing challenges from new digital creativity, as well as the online ad duopoly of Google (GOOG -0.6%, GOOGL -0.8%) and Facebook (FB -0.9%). Tech consultants are proving a challenge as well, Wilmot notes, with firms like Accenture, Cognizant, Deloitte, PwC and IBM taking an increasing share of marketing revenue. But Facebook and Google are the more obvious problem, not only serving as vehicles for the ads but increasingly competing for clients. Wilmot points to Vodafone, now looking at bypassing agencies for its biddable ad budget to work directly with the duopoly -- and the bigger that the two get (and the more data they amass), the easier it will be to work directly with advertisers.

But data speeds are also slowing for Amazon Prime Video (AMZN +1.4%) and the NBC Sports app (CMCSA -1.3%), based on research using the smartphone app Wehe. The study calls out ""differentiation"" in traffic treatment in more than 11,100 occasions by Verizon (VZ -2.5%); 8,398 times by AT&T (T -0.7%); nearly 3,900 times at T-Mobile (TMUS -0.4%); and 339 times at Sprint (S +0.1%).

 It should be Snap's (SNAP -0.1%) and CEO Evan Spiegel's moment, Bloomberg BusinessWeek notes today -- but with rivals copying its popular disappearing-stories approach, it's facing continuing usage challenges. ""Investors have come to see Snap as a smaller, unprofitable Facebook (FB +0.7%) rather than a new idea that should be judged on its own merits,"" Sarah Frier writes, though Spiegel blames part of that on miscommunication. Facebook's in the midst of privacy-related flak, and Twitter (TWTR +0.5%) and YouTube (GOOG +0.5%, GOOGL +0.3%) are wrestling with bots and bad users, but Snap is having trouble gaining traction. Spiegel has drawn criticism for a ""dictatorial management style and penchant for secrecy,"" but has worked toward self-improvement in his approach and in breaking down management silos at the company. Aside from his shyness, Spiegel is dinged for an aversion to criticism (""No exec challenges Evan,"" a former employee says) and a tendency to ignore warnings when he's challenged. Some investors hope for another seasoned leader to come aboard a la Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Frier writes, but their opinions might not matter much with Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy holding all the voting power.

According to multiple executives, WPP (WPPGY +1%), Omnicom (OMC +0.2%) and Publicis Group (PUBGY -0.5%) plan to increase ad spending with Amazon.com to $800M or more in 2018 -- what could be a 40-100% increase, depending on the firm.

877,Report: Mobile apps (mainly familiar ones) dominate digital media time,"Aug. 25, 2017, 4:55 PM","
 Mobile apps are still leading the way among consumers' digital consumption, but they're tending to stick with ones they know and already have, according to a new comScore report. Some 57% of consumers' digital media time is taking place in mobile apps, according to comScore's 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps report, but a majority of consumers download zero apps per month. That 57% activity in mobile apps breaks down as 50% in smartphone apps and 7% in tablet apps. Meanwhile, desktop accounts for 34% of time and mobile Web 9%. Meanwhile, not only are younger users skewing the curve on mobile-apps time spent (those 18-24 are spending 3 hours a day in apps, vs. 2.6 hours for 25-34, and 2.3 hours for 35-44), they're the ones who are downloading new apps. Of those 18-34, 70% say they're always looking for new apps and they're willing to pay for them. Just over 50% of all users don't download new apps, and 66% of users buy zero paid apps per month. The takeaway may be that well-established apps from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are enough for most people, while younger users are keeping alive apps like Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) that aren't finding traction with older users at all.

Asked about whether Berkshire's structure might allow for a Wells Fargo-like sales scandal, Buffett points to a company hotline that gets 4,000 calls a year (""most of them are frivolous ... Anything that looks serious I will hear about"") and suggests that it would be hard for things to get where they were with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) without the CEO knowing, ""and the CEO has to act ...

""Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to the Burlington Northern,"" he says. ""And if driverless cars became pervasive, it would only be because they were safer ... and that would mean that the overall economic cost of auto-related losses had gone down, and that would drive down the premium income of Geico.""

I don?ôt regard them as apples and oranges."" On missed opportunities, ""we failed you"" by not figuring out Google (GOOG, GOOGL) sooner, and ""we blew Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) too,"" Charlie Munger says. ""China has a bright future"" despite growing pains, Munger says, and China's market is a lot cheaper than in the U.S. Buffett has nothing to add: Munger ""gave the headline, China's stock market will outperform the U.S.,"" and he breaks the meeting for lunch, to reconvene at 2:15 p.m. ET.

""In reality, the complexity of designing and manufacturing a vehicle may push the company to integrate deeply with an automotive partner or partners in an effort more similar to the Apple TV -- plugging Apple's technology into an existing product,"" the well-known analyst wrote earlier this week.

This year: ""The history books will say that interest rates bottomed in July 2012, and double-bottomed in July 2016. At some point, the backup in rates will create competition for stocks.""He notes commodity prices look to have bottomed and the Atlanta Fed's wage-growth tracker is now up 4% Y/Y. The valuation argument for equities becomes ""problematic"" once the 10-year yield hits 3%, which could happen this year.Making his last appearance at the confab, Felix Zulauf thinks stocks will struggle and end the year in negative territory, but that's mostly an H2 issue. For now, he wants to stick with what's doing well, and recommends the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEARCA:VTV), the Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), and the Financial Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF).He's also bullish on Japan, where a dovish BOJ and government has shown no sign of caution.

 While Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have grabbed some headlines this week for its ambitious goals with autonomous driving (SAE level 5), the technology is being widely discussed across industries as a potential future reality. At a real estate conference in New York this week, a panel member called autonomous vehicles the biggest tech news concerning real estate in the last ten years. Some see a future reversal of urbanization trends in a development that could have significant investment implications. City planners and architects are already thinking of next-gen design. A paper titled ""Beyond Google's Cute Car"" (.pdf version) is a good example of how cities are being reimagined. Then there's this from the man who designed the 2015 Ford Mustang.?""The next 10 years in this business is going to be the biggest change and challenge since the turn of the last century when cars took over for horses,"" said?Ford design chief Moray Callum. Ford (NYSE:F) aims to have a  high-volume, fully autonomous SAE level 4-capable vehicle in commercial operation in 2021. Self-driving car development is a topic of discussion on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Google (GOOGL, GOOG), Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

1227,Apple 'monitoring' AT&T/Time Warner as media consolidation speeds up,"Oct. 21, 2016, 5:23 PM","
 AT&T's (T -3%) interest in Time Warner (TWX +7.8%) progressed quickly from ""had talks"" to ""advanced talks"" and now a deal could be set by Monday -- which Bloomberg says is due to a sped-up timetable caused by Bloomberg's initial report. That's because AT&T is said to be concerned that the publicity could allow other interested suitors like Apple (AAPL -0.4%) or Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) to jump in -- and indeed Apple is said to be monitoring the deal talks, after it made its own approach to Time Warner a few months ago, The Wall Street Journal reports. Those talks involved execs under Apple chief Tim Cook and didn't get beyond a preliminary stage. A source tells the WSJ that Google doesn't look interested in an offer for Time Warner. But the story of the deal points out just how much behind-the-scenes strategic talk is going on in the media/telecom spaces, as companies vie to be among the new leaders in an upended, converged digital media climate. Sumner Redstone was said to be considering not only the merger of CBS (CBS +2.1%) and Viacom (VIA +2.7%, VIAB +2.8%) that he's already pushing for, but also to combine that entity with Time Warner. Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA -0.5%) could join another company to get involved, the WSJ says, though that makes more sense if Time Warner's open to being parted out. Unlikely to join in this time: Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX +2.2%, FOXA +2.2%), whose own pursuit of Time Warner failed in 2014 at $85/share, and Walt Disney (DIS +1.1%).Previously: Time Warner at 15-year highs on merger talk; media companies rise (Oct. 21 2016)  "

 Twitter (TWTR -2%) is expected to field bids from suitors this week, and an especially interested Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com calls it an ""unpolished jewel,"" The Wall Street Journal reports.

The company is also launching an ad solution for the 2M+ sites/apps on its display ad network that automatically adapts to the kind of content being shown, and giving advertisers access to cross-exchange inventory (increases the number of sites/apps they can reach).
Google argues support for longer ad headlines and descriptions is helpful on mobile, where consumers ""[want] to know exactly what you offer before tapping into your website."" Tests showed an increase of up to 20% in click-through rates.
Meanwhile, in a fresh attempt to get more of the local ad dollars moving to online channels, Google is launching local search ad options for Google Search and Maps that let advertisers prominently show their business locations. It's also testing Promoted Pins, which allow a business' logo to appear within Google Maps, and giving local businesses the ability to showcase special offers and inventory on their pages.
The local ad efforts represent additional competition for Yelp (YELP +2%), which is going after the same ad dollars. Google notes nearly 1/3 of all mobile searches are location-related, and that location-related searches are growing 50% faster than mobile searches in general. Over half of Google's total searches are now via mobile devices.

In other news, ad agency giant IPG's Magna Global unit has struck a multi-year deal to spend $250M on YouTube ads at this Digital Content NewFronts ad sales presentations. Notably, the money will come from Magna's TV ad budget rather than its online ad budget, and is 4-5x the firm's typical YouTube budget. AdWeek says Magna will now ""spend less on traditional marketing overall this year as TV ratings dip.""

 With little prospect of settlement, Google (GOOG +0.6%, GOOGL +0.7%) is headed for its first European Union sanction this year, sources tell Reuters. The company has no further plan for a settlement after three failed compromise attempts since 2016, sources said, and neither party has much left in the way of incentives to reach a deal. That means a likely sanction in the test case tied to Google's shopping service, which European regulators charged was favored by its search results. A second charge recently followed over Google's Android operating system. Last week's news that Google and Microsoft were burying the hatchet may be a sign that Google will strike a deal with the EC, and avoid repeating Microsoft's own damaging fight with Europeans (That company ended up with fines of more than ??.2B after a decade-long fight).

Products covered by Osterloh's unit include Google's Nexus hardware line, its Chromecast HDMI stick, Chromebook laptops, the OnHub home router, the Project Ara modular phone initiative, and (notably) Google Glass. Glass has been overseen by Nest Labs chief Tony Fadell, recently the subject of multiple reports regarding employee discontent within Nest (particularly within its Dropcam home camera unit).

Like other tech giants, Google has seen plenty of talented workers depart over the years to launch startups, with some of the efforts proving to be huge successes (examples include Twitter and Instagram). Area 120 represents an attempt to keep such entrepreneurial workers within the Google empire (to an extent), and profit along the way.

Ad price declines pressured Alphabet/Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Q1 results: Cost per click (CPC) was flat Q/Q but down 9% Y/Y. The company has previously said YouTube video ad growth has depressed CPCs; relatively low smartphone search ad prices have also been an issue. CPCs fell 12% on Google sites and 8% elsewhere.

Paid clicks: Ad click growth remains strong: Paid clicks were down 3% Q/Q (seasonality) but up 29% Y/Y, a growth rate nearly even with Q4's 31%. Paid clicks rose an impressive 38% on Google sites (YouTube, mobile search, and shopping search ad growth), and just 2% on other sites, where ad policy changes and competition from Facebook have weighed.

Segment performance: Google segment revenue rose 17% Y/Y to $20.1B; op. profit rose 21% to $6.3B. The Other Bets segment (dominated by Nest/Dropcam, with Google Fiber also playing a role) saw revenue rise 108% to $166M; op. loss grew to $802M (nearly 5x revenue) from $633M. Forex had a 600 bps impact on total revenue growth (+17% vs. +23%).Within the Google segment, Google sites ad revenue rose 20% to $14.3B, and Network sites ad revenue 3% to $3.7B. Other revenue (Google Play, hardware, etc.) rose 24% to $2.1B.

Financials: Traffic acquisition costs were 21% of Google ad revenue vs. 22% a year ago. Cost of revenue was 38% of revenue vs. 37%, and operating expenses 36% vs. 37%. Stock compensation expense totaled $1.5B vs. $1.2B. The tax rate fell to 18% from 24%, and headcount grew by nearly 9K Y/Y to 64,115.$2.3B was spent to buy back 3.2M shares. Notably, capex fell 17% Y/Y to $2.4B. That, along with revenue growth, helped free cash flow rise 37% to $5.2B. Google/Alphabet ended Q1 with $75.3B in cash/investments (much of it offshore) and $5.2B in debt.

Annual growth accelerated sharply from Q4's 50%, with Kenshoo citing the popularity of newer products such as Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads and Instagram ads.
Client ad impressions rose 14% Q/Q and 6% Y/Y, after seeing negative annual growth in Q4 (Facebook shows fewer ads on phones than PCs). Clicks rose 19% Q/Q and 54% Y/Y, aided by a 45% Y/Y increase in click-through rate (better ad targeting helps). Prices for ads sold on a CPC (cost per click) basis rose 20% Y/Y, and prices for ads shown on a CPM (cost per 1K impressions) basis 75%.
Notably, Instagram made up 17% of social ad clicks, and app install ads (could soon see competition from Apple) 25%. Kenshoo previously reported client social ad spend was up 87% Y/Y in Q1 through February.
Figures for client search ad spend (dominated by Google) were solid, though not spectacular. Ad spend fell 6% Q/Q (seasonality) and rose 13% Y/Y. Impressions rose 31% Y/Y and clicks 36%, but ad prices (cost per click) fell 17%.

1389,Apple reportedly weighs App Store search ads that would compete with Facebook/Google,"Apr. 15, 2016, 12:47 AM","


Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, ""photos"" or ""racing game"") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

1400,Google/YouTube finally joins T-Mobile's Binge On program,"Mar. 17, 2016, 7:20 PM","

After initially refusing to join T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) Binge On program (allows for ""DVD or better"" quality streaming that doesn't count against a user's mobile data bucket) on the grounds the service degraded video quality and didn't explain to users what was going on, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has done an about-face, stating YouTube and Google Play's video content will support the service.

Google suggests its decision stems from several changes made by T-Mobile to Binge On. Among them: 1) Clarifying for users what Binge On's video ""optimization"" does, and making it easier for users to opt out. 2) Allowing any video service meeting traffic-ID requirements to opt out. 3) Allowing video services to work with T-Mobile to optimize their streams.
A few other services have also been added to Binge On, including Discovery GO and Fox Business. Initial Binge On partners (announced in November) included Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Sling TV, and ESPN.

1401,Bloomberg: Google plans to sell robot unit following internal tensions,"Mar. 17, 2016, 1:17 PM","

Having concluded the business ""isn?ôt likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years,"" Alphabet/Google (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.7%) plans to sell its Boston Dynamics robot unit, Bloomberg reports. Toyota and Amazon are viewed as potential buyers.

Google acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 as part of a broader push to commercialize advanced robots that could be deployed in the home, in factories, and elsewhere. Boston has partnered with various military agencies, and YouTube videos of its robots moving at high speeds, displaying humanoid traits, and/or staying on their feet while navigating rugged terrain have been quite popular.
Bloomberg states Google's decision follows tensions between Boston and others taking part of Google's robot initiative, known as Replicant. Boston execs were reportedly reluctant to work with Google robot engineers in California and Tokyo, and the unit was unable to come up with a product that could be released in the short-term.
Three months ago, Google folded Replicant into its Google X long-term R&D unit, but didn't include Boston in the restructuring. The move occurred a little over a year after robotics chief (and former Android chief) Andy Rubin left the company.

1402,"Report: Apple signs up for Google's cloud, uses much less of Amazon's (updated)","Mar. 16, 2016, 5:24 PM","

Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on ""a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language"" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. ""Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives.""
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. ""It?ôs true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud.""

1403,WSJ: EU getting closer to charging Google over Android,"Mar. 15, 2016, 4:34 PM","


The WSJ reports the EU is moving closer toward filing charges against Alphabet/Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over the company's favoring of its own apps on Android. A recent EC information request to Google rivals suggests regulators are prepping a ""statement of objections"" to back up its charges.
Last April, the EU charged Google with favoring its own shopping service (Google Shopping) within searches. The Android probe could have larger consequences, since Google's required bundling of its own apps and services on phones/tablets using the company's version of Android is a core part of its mobile monetization strategy - it has both helped several Google products (Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Play) top 1B monthly active users, and kept the company's traffic acquisition costs down.
The WSJ's report comes shortly after a Russian court upheld an adverse fall ruling by local regulators over Google's Android bundling practices. To comply with the Russian ruling, which grants a win to search rival Yandex, Google has to amend its contracts with smartphone OEMs and pay a fine of up to 15% of its 2014 revenue from pre-loaded apps.

As part of its latest push to grab share from market leader Facebook in the lucrative mobile app install ad market, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) will start allowing mobile users to demo a game for up to 10 minutes from within its mobile search results, via cloud-based streaming. After the 10 minutes are up, the game demo, which doubles as an ad, will give users the option to download the full game.
Also launched by Google for app developers: New tools for managing virtual goods and currencies, an API that lets game-players stream and share gaming sessions via YouTube, and the ability to deliver targeted ads to users who spent 30+ minutes playing games in the last 30 days.
Google has already integrated app install ads within its search results, Google Play, and its AdMob mobile ad network. Aside from landing more ad dollars from app developers, Google is looking to give mobile users another reason to rely on mobile search results (and the mobile web in general), rather than solely relying on mobile apps. Other efforts along these lines include Now on Tap, the deep linking of app content within search results, and Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative, which allows optimized articles pulled up via Google search to load almost instantaneously.

1407,Baird: Facebook partner data points to accelerating Q1 sales growth,"Mar. 14, 2016, 3:15 PM","

Through February, clients of Facebook (FB +0.5%) ad partner Kenshoo had increased their social media ad spend by 87% Y/Y, up from Q4's 50%, reports Baird's Colin Sebastian (Outperform rating, $120 target). Sebastian adds strong demand for Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads - they allow multiple products from an advertiser's catalog to be promoted - is contributing to the growth,, as is growing Instagram monetization.

Kenshoo estimates Dynamic Product Ads now make up 8%-9% of total social media ad clicks. Video ad clicks account for an estimated ~20% of Facebook's total (the same as Q4), and app install ads - a market for which Google (GOOG, GOOGL) just unveiled new offerings tied to mobile search - 10% of Facebook ad spend. Both search and social ad spend are deemed healthy as online ads continue taking share from offline channels, with search still accounting for ~3x as much spending as social.
Not surprisingly, Sebastian believes Facebook (has a long history of posting sales/earnings beats) can top Q1 estimates. Kenshoo also provided strong numbers in January ahead of Facebook's Q4 report - the company wound up trouncing estimates on the back of 57% Y/Y ad sales growth, up from Q3's 45% and Q2's 43%.

1410,RBC: Google and Facebook are as dominant as ever in online advertising (updated),"Mar. 9, 2016, 11:56 AM","

""When asked to rank order all the major Online Advertising platforms based on ROI, marketers placed platforms in three clear groups: Google (GOOG +1.1%, GOOGL +1.3%), Facebook (FB +1.1%) & YouTube (?úYT?? again lead, Twitter and LinkedIn are in the middle, and Yahoo and AOL are last,"" reports RBC's Mark Mahaney following a survey of nearly 2,000 ad pros. ""We note that Twitter (TWTR -3.5%) was the only platform to see a clear falloff in its relative ROI vs. our prior survey, while AOL showed a modest improvement.""
Mahaney adds 62% of Facebook, 54% of Google, 48% of YouTube (Google-owned), and 32% of Twitter advertisers plan to up their ad spend on the platforms over the next year. Only 9%, 10%, and 8% of Facebook, Google, and YouTube advertisers plan to cut their ad spend; for Twitter, the number is 23%.
31% of Google advertisers and 28% of Facebook advertisers spend over 30% of their online budgets on the platforms. 59% of Facebook, 42% of Google, and 39% of YouTube advertisers think their ROIs have improved over the last 6 months. Notably, 69% of advertisers had positive attitudes towards Facebook's autoplay video ads, and 76% have a YouTube budget allocation.
Mahaney states Twitter, which provided soft Q1 guidance last month, ""generally had the weakest results with respect to advertiser budget allocation, expected future spend, and general satisfaction."" Meanwhile, a record 45% of survey respondents showed an interest in advertising on Snpachat (CHAT), which is reportedly aiming for 2016 revenue of $300M-$350M.
The survey data comes after both Google and Facebook reported strong Q4 ad figures. Google's revenue from its own sites rose 20% Y/Y in Q4 to $14.9B, as 40% paid click growth (fueled by YouTube and mobile search) more than offset a 16% drop in ad prices. Facebook's ad revenue (boosted by Instagram's ad growth) rose 57% Y/Y in Q4 to $5.6B, an improvement from Q3's 45% growth.

1411,"Facebook pulls plug on ad-buying service test, cites ""bad ads and fraud""","Mar. 7, 2016, 1:10 PM","

Following a test with advertisers, Facebook (FB -1.9%) has pulled the plug on a demand-side ad-buying platform (i.e. a DSP) for its Atlas ad-server/measurement solution.
Ad tech chief David Jakubowski states low ad quality drove Facebook's decision. ""[W]e plugged into a number of the usual exchanges and bought across several formats ... We were able to deliver ads to real people with unprecedented accuracy, but came up against many bad ads and fraud (like bots). While we were fortunately able to root out the bad actors and only buy quality ads, we were amazed by the volume of valueless inventory.""
Notably, he adds the only ad formats that ""delivered significant value"" during the test were native ads (Facebook and Instagram feed ads are native ad types) and video ads (another area Facebook is well-exposed to). Not surprisingly, mobile ads in general delivered much of the ""true business value"" found in the test. Facebook VP Brian Boland claims native/video ads delivered ""7x better results than banner ads.""
As part of its efforts to double down on ad types it considers effective, Facebook is rolling out new tools for Atlas: A tool for measuring the impact of online ads on offline sales, a service that gives advertisers insights on how users see ads across devices before making a purchase, and a video-ad-serving/measurement service. Jakubowski: ""[M]any marketers still choose to deliver and measure their ad campaigns using desktop-first tools that are not built for a cross-device world ??and they?ôve got the wasted spend to show for it.""
Facebook has tried to differentiate Atlas in part by using anonymous Facebook profile data (rather than cookies) to measure ad performance across devices. Atlas competes against Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) DoubleClick unit, which (among other things) is a major player in the DSP space through its Bid Manager platform. Independent DSP providers Rocket Fuel (FUEL +5.1%) and Sizmek (SZMK +3.9%) are higher today.

16 months after unveiling its Echo Web-connected Bluetooth speaker and voice assistant, Amazon (AMZN -0.6%) has announced two cheaper, more portable devices containing a lot of the same features.
Whereas the $180 Echo needs to be connected to a power outlet, the Tap is battery-powered. Like Echo, both the $130 Tap and ($90) Dot support Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which was opened up last year to 3rd-party developers. However, while the Tap was built with music playback in mind - it has dual-firing Dolby speakers - the Dot has one tiny speaker and is promoted more as a personal assistant, smart alarm clock, and home automation device.
Notably, Amazon has struck a deal with Google/Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Nest unit to allow Nest's smart thermostats to be controlled via Alexa-powered devices. Re/code reports Nest considered making a product similar to the Echo, but decided not to, largely out of concern consumers would be nervous about Google-related privacy issues.
For now, Dot purchases are limited to Prime users ordering via Alexa, using the Echo or a Fire TV device. The Echo has been a low-key success for Amazon - its Amazon page currently shows over 33K customer reviews, and an average rating of 4.5/5 stars.

The remarks come after Finance Minister Michel Sapin ruled out a tax settlement similar to the $185M deal Google/Alphabet (GOOG -1.6%) has struck with British authorities, stating France is seeking ""far greater"" sums.
Google had just a 5% effective tax rate in Q4, down from 18% a year ago. The company notes two one-time in the U.S. had a 17% impact on its tax rate - a multi-year audit had a 9% impact, and an R&D tax credit had an 8% impact. The EU has been probing the tax payments of Google, Apple, and various other U.S. multinationals for some time.
Separately, Google has begun highlighting articles using its Accelerated Mobile Page (AMP) platform within mobile search results.

In a marquee win for Google (GOOG -1.5%) in its battle against cloud infrastructure giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription music streaming leader Spotify (MUSIC) has announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform.
Spotify, which has historically relied on its own servers: ""The storage, compute and network services available from cloud providers are as high quality, high performance and low cost as what the traditional approach provides. This makes the move to the cloud a no-brainer for us. Google, in our experience, has an edge here, but it?ôs a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future.""
The company adds Google's unmatched data platform and tools were a big selling point. ""Good infrastructure isn?ôt just about keeping things up and running, it?ôs about making all of our teams more efficient and more effective, and Google?ôs data stack does that for us in spades."" Spotify VP Nicholas Harteau says his firm has already moved 250K of its 20M user accounts onto Google's cloud, and will migrate its entire service to Google within 18 months.
Spotify never mentions AWS in its announcement. However, the company is listed on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) site as a client. Per Amazon, Spotify has used AWS' S3 storage service to store music tracks, and its CloudFront CDN service to deliver apps and software updates.
The deal comes a few months after Google put VMware co-founder Diane Greene in charge of its cloud businesses, following the acquisition of a startup Greene founded (Bebop Technologies).

Google/Alphabet (GOOG -0.1%) is developing a VR headset that doesn't need to be paired with a PC, phone, or console, the WSJ reports. The company is also reportedly working on a more advanced version of its ~$20 Cardboard VR viewer, which relies on Android phones to provide a headset's CPU, display, sensors, and software. The Cardboard successor is said to be made of plastic, and to contain chips and sensors.
The report follows one from the FT stating Google is building a new VR headset for smartphones that will ""feature better sensors, lenses and a more solid plastic casing"" than Cardboard. It also follows Google's creation of a standalone VR unit led by former Google Apps chief Clay Bavor.
Facebook, whose Oculus unit is generally seen as having an early hardware/software lead in the VR market, is due to begin shipping its first commercial Oculus Rift VR headset next month - it costs $599, and needs to be paired with a PC featuring a high-end GPU. Oculus has also partnered with Samsung to launch the less powerful Gear VR headset - it costs $99, and needs to be paired with a Samsung smartphone.

He'll be replaced by John Giannandrea, an engineering VP in charge of Google's A.I./machine learning efforts. Giannandrea's background is noteworthy in light of the huge machine learning investments Google is making for both its core search engine and Google Now.
Though not the most headline-grabbing part of Google's empire anymore, search remains (by far) the company's biggest profit creator. Improving mobile search monetization and Google Shopping search ad growth had (along with YouTube's ad growth) much to do with Google's 31% Y/Y Q4 paid click growth.

Bloomberg reports Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is ""planning to publicly give its support"" for Qualcomm's (QCOM +1.4%) first ARM (ARMH +2.2%) server CPUs at an investor event next week. It adds Google and Qualcomm have cooperated on design work, and that the former will commit to using the latter's chips if they meet performance goals.
Google is the world's biggest server buyer, and has largely relied on Intel's (INTC -4.1%) Xeon CPUs. The Web giant's adoption of Qualcomm processors, even if for only a fraction of its workload, would act as a major reference win for the fledgling ARM server CPU market. There has been speculation Amazon might also adopt ARM server CPUs, following its acquisition of chip startup Annapurna Labs (recently unveiled a line of low-end network processors).
Qualcomm is just four months removed from showing off a prototype ARM server CPU featuring custom cores. The company has been hoping the server market will provide a long-term sales lift as it continues dealing with mobile pressures - Qualcomm's chip division (QCT) sales fell 22% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $4.1B.
Intel has been hoping to keep Google and other major Web/cloud clients loyal in part by providing custom Xeon CPUs, and by creating products that place Xeon chips and recently-acquired Altera's FPGAs (can be programmed on the fly to handle new algorithms/code) in the same package. Qualcomm has partnered with Altera archrival Xilinx.

1424,"Google/Alphabet's call: Gmail users, paid clicks, 2016 capex, offshore cash discussed","Feb. 1, 2016, 5:58 PM","

With strong mobile growth providing a lift, Gmail has topped 1B monthly active users, Alphabet/Google (GOOG, GOOGL) disclosed on its Q4 call. The e-mail service had 900M MAUs as of last May. Other Google offerings with 1B+ MAUs: Search, Android, YouTube, Maps, Chrome, and Google Play. (live blogs: WSJ, MarketWatch)
Regarding surging paid click volumes (up 31% Y/Y in Q4, with 40% growth on Google sites), Google once more mentioned the impact of YouTube's TrueView ad format - a video ad viewed from start to finish is considered a paid click. CFO Ruth Porat mentioned ad format changes served to lower ad prices and boost clicks, and declared both mobile and PC ad monetization to be healthy.
Porat urged analysts to look at the performance of Google's Other Bets segment - it had 2015 revenue of $448M and op. loss of $3.57B - on an annual basis rather than a quarterly one, and insisted Google is being efficient with its investments. Nest, Fiber, and the Verily life sciences unit are said to be the main revenue-generating parts of the Other Bets segment.
She added capex is expected to grow again 2016, after surprisingly dropping in 2015 to $9.9B (equal to 13% of revenue). In addition to Google's data center infrastructure, Fiber and other bets will be an area of focus for capex.
Also mentioned: 1) Spending from Google Play store buyers rose 30% in 2015. 2) U.S. revenue rose 24% Y/Y, and U.K. revenue (hurt some by a strong dollar) 16%. Forex had a $1.3B revenue impact, or $1B after factoring currency hedges. 3) Google is pushing for exclusive content for the YouTube Red subscription service. 4) ~$43B of Google's $73.1B cash balance is overseas.

Ahead of Thursday afternoon's Q4 report, Piper's Gene Munster (Overweight rating, $800 target) declares near-term Street estimates for Amazon (AMZN +1.4%) to be too low, and insists the company can grow margins while making big investments.
Munster asserts Amazon's 2015 margin expansion was driven by $10B worth of gross profit growth, fulfillment leverage, and strong Prime adoption, rather than spending cuts. He sees op. margin growing 240 bps in 2016, fueled by AWS growth, lower Prime customer retargeting expenses, robotics investments, a mix shift towards third-party sales, and the leveraging of Amazon's Indian infrastructure.
He adds Piper's Amazon Search Index indicates the company saw 24%-26% Y/Y unit growth in Q4, and believes markets only expect 22%-24%. The note comes a year after Munster called Amazon his top 2015 pick. Shares rose 118% in 2015 with the help of market-pleasing AWS figures; they're down 11% in 2016 amid a market selloff.

To encourage tests, the DOT also plans to make up to 2,500 self-driving cars exempt from some proposed safety rules for up to two years, and to work with state governments to create state regulations for autonomous vehicles. It suggests an interest in lowering auto fatalities is behind the effort. Foxx: ""We ask ourselves, 'What if human error could be eliminated? That is a possibility worth pursuing.""

Yahoo Autos reports Google/Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F) are creating a JV that will build self-driving cars using Google's technology. The companies reportedly plan to announce their effort at CES (runs from Jan. 6-9).
The JV, which limits Ford's legal liability, is said to be non-exclusive. Google has also been talking with other automakers, as it pushes forward with a goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. The company has suggested it doesn't want to be an auto manufacturer itself, but rather a hardware/software supplier to third-party automakers.
The report comes a week after one from Bloomberg stating Google plans to make its self-driving car unit a separate Alphabet company. In September, Google hired ex-Hyundai America chief John Krafcik to lead its self-driving efforts.
Google has a head-start in both creating advanced self-driving systems/prototypes and collecting real-world driving data - it has logged 1.3M miles to date - but is far from alone in going after the market. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Volvo, and Tesla are among the existing automakers to have invested in autonomous driving R&D. Baidu, Samsung, and Uber are also interested, and Apple reportedly so.

Unlike Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu, YouTube isn't looking to license shows and movies that have already aired elsewhere, but rather brand-new material. A source states the content could be either exclusively streamed on Red or simultaneously released via movie theaters, TV networks, DVDs, etc.
Red, which launched in October, combines ad-free YouTube with offline downloads, the Google Play Music streaming service, and exclusive access to some YouTube-financed content. Hollywood content licenses would further up Google's investment in the service, which many suspect is being sold at a loss given its price is on par with that of popular standalone music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music.

Mahaney notes core Google (features search, display ads, Maps, Google Apps, YouTube, and Android) has seen 17%-23% Y/Y organic growth each quarter for the last 3 years, and estimates the business has a near-50% op. margin. He sees YouTube and Android (estimated 2015 revenue of $7B and $4B, respectively) helping sustain the core Google's growth.
Among non-core assets, Mahaney argues Nest and Fiber are each set to produce over $1B/year in revenue, and that other businesses (e.g. self-driving cars, the Calico anti-aging unit) could also produce substantial value. He estimates Google's non-core assets will have a 2015 op. loss somewhere between $3B and $6B, and sees a major opportunity to cut costs under new CFO Ruth Porat (previous).

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has bought Bebop Technologies, a stealth-mode startup that has been working on an enterprise cloud app development platform, and which was founded by VMware co-founder and Google board member Diane Greene.
Greene will now lead a new unit containing all of Google's cloud businesses, including Google Apps (productivity apps), Google for Work (custom versions of Google products for enterprises), and the Google Cloud Platform (cloud infrastructure and app platform services). CEO Sundar Pichai declares the move will ""bring together product, engineering, marketing and sales and allow us to operate in a much more integrated, coordinated fashion.""

The move comes shortly after Google SVP Urs H√∂lze proclaimed (in remarks that may or may not have been blessed by Google's brass) the company's Cloud Platform revenue could surpass its ad revenue in five years.

Having already given up on both making Google+ a full-blown Facebook rival and an identity layer across Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) empire, the Web giant has now revamped the platform to emphasize its Communities feature for connecting with users that have common interests (competes to an extent with Facebook's Groups), and its Collections post-grouping feature.
Google: ""We?ôve spent a lot of time listening to what people using Google+ had to say. There were two features they kept coming back to: Communities, which now average 1.2 million new joins per day, and Collections, which launched just five months ago and is growing even faster ... Now focused around interests, the new Google+ is much simpler. And it?ôs more mobile-friendly?îwe?ôve rebuilt it across web, Android and iOS so that you?ôll have a fast and consistent experience whether you are on a big screen or small one.""
Google is five months removed from no longer requiring users of YouTube and other services log in via Google+, and six months removed from moving cloud photo storage/sharing into a standalone Google Photos apps.
Separately, Google has disclosed Chrome now has 800M+ monthly active users on iOS and Android, up from 400M a year ago. It adds Chrome, which had over 1B total active users as of May, is now used to send 350M daily push notifications from 2,300 sites.
Chrome's business value to Google stems both from its ability to drive traffic to Google search via address bar and home page integration - Microsoft browsers and Apple's iOS/Mac OS Spotlight search feature have Bing as their default search engine, and Firefox has Yahoo in the U.S. - and from eliminating the traffic acquisition costs Google has to pay for default search deals for 3rd-party browsers such as Apple's Safari.

1450,Yandex rallies on Morgan Stanley upgrade; Google plans to contest Russian ruling,"Nov. 17, 2015, 12:41 PM","

Morgan Stanley has upgraded Yandex (YNDX +5.9%) to Overweight, and hiked its target by $2 to $20. Shares are close to a 5-month high of $16.61.
Separately, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) says it will contest in court a September ruling from Russian regulators declaring the company's Android app/service bundling requirements violate antitrust law. Yandex, which has been losing Russian search share to Google thanks in part to the latter's strong mobile share, soared when the ruling was announced.
Google has until Dec. 18 to amend its deals with smartphone OEMs to comply with the Russian ruling. Meanwhile, Yandex recently disclosed it's among the long list of firms to have asked EU regulators to probe Google's Android policies.

 Google's (GOOG) anticipated YouTube Music app is live in the U.S. on iOS and Android. As the name implies, the app provides a tailored experience for accessing and finding content within YouTube's giant music video library (still available through the main YouTube app). In addition to standard music videos, additional content such as concert footage, karaoke tracks, and embedded lyrics is included.
Those signing up for the recently-launched, $10/month, YouTube Red subscription service get ad-free access, as well as support for offline, background, and audio-only playback. Those installing Music get a free 14-day trial for Red, which also provides ad-free/offline access to content provided through the Google Play Music app. Ad-blockers can replicate Red's ad-free functionality on PC browsers and more recently Mobile Safari, but not within YouTube's apps.
YouTube reportedly had 2014 revenue of $4B, and played a large role in Google's 23% Y/Y Q3 paid click growth. A YouTube Gaming app was unveiled in June.

1453,Google plans to start delivering packages by drone in 2017,"Nov. 2, 2015, 4:05 PM","

More than a year after Google (GOOG +1.4%) disclosed it has launched a delivery drone initiative called Project Wing, Wing chief David Vos states Google aims to begin delivering packages to consumers via drones in 2017.
Details remain scant on what types of packages will be supported, where they'll be delivered, and at what scale. The Atlantic previously reported Google's drone design is ""a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around."" The drones will lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics at the end"" that detect when a package has hit the ground.
The Google Express same-day delivery service (delivers goods on behalf of 3rd-party retailers) would be a natural fit for Wing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile is pushing ahead with its Prime Air drone delivery project. Questions still remain about the reliability and safety of large-scale drone delivery (particularly in densely-populated urban areas), as well as battery life and noise.
Separately, in response to last week's WSJ report stating Google plans to merge Android and Chrome OS into a unified OS for PCs and mobile devices, Google says it ""has no plan to phase out Chrome OS,"" but adds it's ""working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems."" Re/code had followed up on the WSJ's report by reporting Google will work with PC OEMs starting in 2016 to bring Android PCs to market, while allowing them to keep building Chrome OS PCs if they want.

1454,"WSJ: Google plans to merge Android, Chrome OS into single OS (updated)","Oct. 29, 2015, 5:28 PM","

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) engineers have been working for about two years to fuse Android and Chrome OS, the WSJ reports. The Web giant plans to preview a unified operating system in 2016, and launch it in 2017.
A unified OS appears to mesh with new Google CEO Sundar Pichai's worldview. Pichai, who once directly oversaw Android and Chrome OS, predicted on Google's Q3 call ""mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.""
It would also be similar to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OS strategy: Windows 10 serves as a common OS for PCs and mobile devices, with the platform's Continuum technology enabling universal apps whose UIs change based on whether keyboard/mouse or touch input is being used. Apple, by contrast, continues to reiterate it has no plans to merge iOS and Mac OS; Tim Cook famously referred to such integration as being akin to combining a refrigerator and a toaster.
Possibly contributing to Google's decision: Android is far more popular than Chrome OS, claiming 1.4B active users as of September and an 82.8% Q2 smartphone unit share (per IDC), not to mention a giant developer base. By contrast, IDC estimates Chrome OS has less than 3% of the global PC market (the education market is a strong point). Thus, officially expanding Android's focus to the PC market through an OS supporting universal apps and Google Play could provide a shot in the arm for Google's PC ambitions.

Update: Re/code follows up on the WSJ's report by reporting Google will start working with OEMs in 2016 to develop PCs running on Android, and that OEMs will still be able to build Chrome OS PCs if they want to.

""With over 1.5 billion searches per day and over 2 trillion posts in our index, search is an important, long-term effort at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),"" the social networking giant states while unveiling a major overhaul of its search engine. All Facebook posts can now be accessed via keyword-based searches, provided a post is accessible to a user based on its privacy settings. Personalized search suggestions are also provided.
In addition to allowing users to more quickly find older posts, photos, and videos from themselves and friends, Facebook's revamped search engine gives it the potential to act as an alternative to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for real-time news search. A search for ""World Series"" turns up related trending topics, relevant posts from friends, and posts from Sports Illustrated, the NYT, NBC News, and other media sources. The overhaul comes amid reports Facebook is prepping Notify, an app that manages and sends out push notifications from news sources and other publishers.
The update also raises the possibility of public Facebook posts being indexed by and integrated with Google, Bing, and other search engines. Twitter already has integration deals with Google and Bing.
For now, Facebook reiterates it's not focused on monetizing search for the time being; keyword-based search ads are a natural fit for the new search engine. A Bing integration deal was ended last year.

YouTube Red, the online video giant's anticipated subscription service, provides ad-free access to YouTube's video library (including music videos), as well as offline downloads. It also includes a subscription to the Google Play Music streaming/offline download service, and supports the newly-launched YouTube Gaming service. The service becomes available on Oct. 28 in the U.S., and will soon afterwards launch globally
Red's pricing is bound to draw attention - it's on par with what Spotify, Apple, and others charge for standalone music streaming services - and raises the question of whether Google (GOOG -0.7%) is choosing to absorb near-term losses on the service for the sake of subscriber growth. Google is giving content providers a 55% aggregate subscription revenue cut (on par with their standard ad revenue cut), and also has to pay music licensing fees.
YouTube has 1B+ monthly active users to cross-sell the service to. Over half the platform's video views now come from mobile devices, and the average mobile viewing session has grown to more than 40 minutes. 80% of views come from outside the U.S.
Re/code has reported YouTube plans to make some of the original content it has financed available only to subscribers. No word yet on whether YouTube will also begin providing licensed material from 3rd-party studios - a move that would put Red into more direct competition with the likes of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.

Update: In remarks to The Verge, YouTube exec Robert Kyncl suggests his company won't go after the same premium content as Netflix or Hulu. ""To us what is important is we are not doing what everyone else is doing, competing for the same sources of material, the same creative elements.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will provide Yahoo (YHOO) with Web and image search services, as well as search ads via its AdSense for Search (AFS) platform (allows a custom Google-powered search engine to be provided). The deal covers both PCs and mobile devices, and will apply to Yahoo proprieties and affiliate sites in the U.S., Canada, and various Asian, African, and Latin American markets (but apparently not Europe, where regulators have been closely probing Google). (8-K filing)
Google will ""pay Yahoo a percentage of the gross revenues from AFS ads displayed on Yahoo Properties or Affiliate Sites,"" with the exact figure varying based on geography and platform. Yahoo will pay fees for Web and image search results. Yahoo ""has discretion to select which search queries to send to Google and is not obligated to send any minimum number of search queries.""
The deal, which could raise some eyebrows among regulators given Google's search dominance, follows an April restructuring of Yahoo's search pact with Microsoft/Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT) that made the alliance non-exclusive on both PCs and mobile. The revised deal still requires 51% of Yahoo's PC search traffic to carry Bing results and ads.

comScore estimates Yahoo had a 12.7% September PC search share in the U.S. (still by far the world's biggest ad market). Google's share is pegged at 63.8%, and Microsoft's at 20.6%. StatCounter estimates Yahoo's U.S. mobile/tablet search share is at 6.8%, and Google's at 88.4%.
YHOO -0.6% after hours after disclosing the deal in tandem with a Q3 miss. GOOG is flat. There was already speculation a deal could happen, given Yahoo has been testing Google-powered results.

Amazon (AMZN -1.9%) fared better, with same-store sales rising 19.2%. However, that's down from August's 24.7%, and also a 12-month low. 35.9% of Amazon-related GMV relied on Amazon's fulfillment services (FBA), up from 29.9% a year ago, with sellers using FBA seeing 30.1% same-store growth.
Google Shopping/Product Listing Ads (indirectly competes with Amazon) were strong, registering 46.1% same-store growth with the help of higher conversion rates. Some of their growth came at the expense of search ads (dominated by Google), which saw a 9.5% same-store decline.

1472,"Amazon reportedly explores live streaming service, tops Google in shopping search survey (updated)","Oct. 6, 2015, 3:11 PM","

""Multiple content owners have told me that Amazon (AMZN -1.6%) has been quietly asking them about licensing content for a live streaming service,"" streaming industry analyst Dan Rayburn reports. He cautions those he has spoken to haven't disclosed how far Amazon has progressed in creating such a service, and that the company may simply be exploring its economics.
Rayburn notes Amazon's recent purchase of video encoding/processing software and service provider Elemental Technologies (reportedly for ~$500M) would be helpful if it goes ahead with a live streaming launch. This year has seen Dish and Sony respectively launch their Sling TV and PlayStation Vue Web TV services; there have also been several reports Apple is prepping an offering.
Separately, in a report that helps back up Eric Schmidt's assertion that Amazon (rather than Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.) is Google's (GOOG -0.2%) biggest search rival, e-commerce software firm BloomReach states a survey of 2,000 U.S. shoppers found 44% go directly to Amazon's site/apps when looking looking to buy/research a product online. 34% start with Google or another search engine, and 21% go to another retailer's site.
Direct visits to Amazon affect Google's search ad revenue, which depends heavily on ad-buying from online retailers (including Amazon). Google has been trying to counter Amazon by integrating its successful Product Listing Ads with search results, and (through a feature called Purchases on Google) by allowing those who click on the ads to complete their orders on Google's site, using payment data already connected to their Google account.
Amazon's AWS re:Invent conference kicks off today. New product announcements, including possibly an analytics service, are expected during a Wednesday keynote (starts at 11:30AM ET) from AWS chief Andy Jassy.

Update (10/7): Bloomberg also reports Amazon is working on an online TV service. It adds the company has reached out to network owners such as CBS and NBCUniversal to gauge their interest.

1473,Google higher after Oppenheimer upgrades; Alphabet goes into effect today,"Oct. 2, 2015, 2:01 PM","

Arguing two new ad products will put Google (GOOG +1.7%, GOOGL +1.5%) on better competitive footing with Facebook, Oppenheimer's Jason Helfstein has upgraded to Outperform, and hiked his target by $30 to $700.
Helfstein notes Google's recently-announced Customer Match product, which lets marketers send targeted ads to users who have already provided them with an e-mail address, helps Google counter Facebook's Custom Audiences, which does something similar. Meanwhile, Universal App Campaigns (announced in May), which enables app install ad campaigns running across search, mobile sites, Google Play, YouTube, and the AdMob mobile ad network, takes aim at Facebook's lucrative app install ad business.
He also downplays concerns about ad-blockers, citing Google's control over Chrome and Android, financial clout to pay for whitelist status on ad-blockers (provided a particular ad-blocker supports the arrangement), and a mix shift from display to search ads. Worth noting: Chrome supports ad-blockers on PCs, and some blockers remove search ads.
Meanwhile, Helfstein thinks Google's bread-and-butter search ad business remains healthy. ""While desktop search is losing share to emerging formats (video, mobile, etc.), total search will still represent the majority of Internet ad spend in the U.S. (45%) and internationally (47%). Mobile search is growing at a ??3-??8 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% in the U.S. and 36% internationally.""
Separately, Google's restructuring into a holding company called Alphabet will officially go into effect after today's close. Google's stock tickers and board will remain the same. Alphabet's units include core Google (run by Sundar Pichai), Nest, Fiber, Calico, Google Ventures, Google Capital, and the Google X long-term R&D unit.

1474,"Google, Microsoft end phone/Xbox patent battle, agree to cooperate","Sep. 30, 2015, 5:30 PM","

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ended a long-running patent spat involving about 20 suits in the U.S. and Germany. Financial terms are confidential.
Microsoft, which collects royalties from Samsung, HTC, and many other Android OEMs, had alleged Google's former Motorola Mobility unit (sold to Lenovo) infringed its IP. Google, which held onto most of Motorola's patents following the Lenovo deal, alleged Xbox consoles infringed its patents.
Much like Google/Motorola's settlement with Apple last year, the Microsoft deal comes with an agreement to cooperate on various patent issues. The tech giants plan to work on a royalty-free video codec meant to improve download/streaming speeds - Amazon and Netflix also back the effort - and lobby for a unified European patent system.
Separately, in a move that could partly be a response to ad-blockers, Google states its display ad network will now only charge advertisers for ads that are 100% viewable by by users. The company estimates 56% of display ads ""never had a chance to be viewed because they were below the fold, scrolled out of view, or in a background tab.""
Concerns about ad-blockers have grown following the recent launch of iOS 9, which supports blockers for Mobile Safari. JPMorgan has downplayed those concerns, arguing most ad-blocking takes place on desktops, that far more time is spent on mobile apps (largely immune to ad-blocking for now) than browsers, that publishers are starting to withhold content from those using ad-blockers, and that ad spend is shifting towards formats more immune to ad-blocking (e.g. native ads). The firm is concerned, however, about the fact ad-blockers prevent valuable tracking data from being collected.

1475,Google unveils Nexus 6P and 5X phones; Android users top 1.4B (updated),"Sep. 29, 2015, 12:35 PM","

As expected, Google (GOOG +0.5%) has refreshed its Nexus phone lineup with two models - a smaller device from LG known as the Nexus 5X, and a phablet from Huawei known as the Nexus 6P. (live blog)
The 6P sports a 5.7"" 2K OLED display - a moderate positive for Universal Display (OLED -0.7%), which still depends heavily on Samsung phone sales - and the 5X a 5.2"" display. Both devices support 4K and slow-motion video recording, come with fingerprint sensors and reversible USB Type-C ports (said to charge twice as fast as the iPhone 6+), sport 12MP rear cameras with large 1.55-micron pixels (good for low-light photography), and run on stock Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).
Traditionally, Google hasn't aimed for Nexus devices to become mass-market hits, but rather to serve as proof-of-concepts for its vision of what Android hardware and software should be. The company unveiled its Project Fi mobile phone service (only works with the Nexus 6 phablet for now) in April.
Google has also announced Android now has over 1.4B active users, and Google Play over 1B active users. The company stated in June 2014 Android's user base had topped 1B.

Update: Google states the Nexus 6P and 5X will join the Nexus 6 in working with Project Fi when they go on sale in October. Pricing has also been disclosed: The 6P will start at $499, and the 5X at $379.

Update 2: Some more hardware launches: The Pixel C, a 10.2"" Android tablet that starts at $499 and has a $149 detachable keyboard accessory; a new Chromecast HDMI dongle with an improved Wi-Fi radio; and Chromecast Audio, a $35 Wi-Fi streaming device that plugs into existing speakers.

Re/code reports Google (GOOG -2.2%, GOOGL -2.1%) is prepping a subscription service that pairs two YouTube offerings previously expected to be sold separately: YouTube's Music Key service (provides ad-free music videos and audio-only streams, currently in beta), and a pending service (confirmed in April) providing ad-free access to YouTube content in general.
Notably, Re/code adds video industry sources have been told by Google it plans to charge just $10/month for the combined service - a price matching that charged by Spotify, Apple, and many others for standalone subscription music offerings. As the site observes, Google could struggle to turn a profit on the service at that price - Spotify has been losing money, and doesn't have to worry about payments to (non-music) video partners.
YouTube, for its part, only says it's ""progressing according to plan to provide fans more options in how they enjoy content on YouTube,"" and that content partners representing over 95% of watch time have agreed to support an ad-free video service. The online video giant recently told content owners they must agree to support an ad-free service by Oct. 22, or else their videos ""will no longer be available for public display or monetization in the United States.""

iOS 9 officially launched on Wednesday, and brought with it support for 3rd-party ad-blockers for Apple's Mobile Safari browser. Several ad-blockers - Crystal, Purify, Blockr, and before it was pulled today, Peace - have quickly jumped towards the top of App Store paid download charts.
Google (GOOG -1.4%), whose various ad platforms (AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, YouTube) are vulnerable to browser ad-blockers, is in the crosshairs. As are numerous online ad tech firms connecting publishers and sellers with each other and/or ad exchanges.
Softening the blow for Google: Browsing done via its Chrome browser or core app - both are popular on iOS - isn't affected, nor is the YouTube app. Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter, which get far more mobile traffic from their apps than their sites, might see only a modest hit. StatCounter estimates Safari had a 22.9% global mobile/tablet browser share in August, down from 31.2% a year ago and below a combined 46% for Chrome and the stock Android browser.
On the flip side, iOS accounts for a disproportionate % of mobile usage and online shopping among the higher-income users coveted by advertisers, and also within the U.S. (45% of Google's Q2 revenue). StatCounter pegs Safari's U.S. mobile/tablet share at 55.2%, and Chrome/stock Android's at 39.5%.
PC browser ad-blocking has already seen tremendous growth, especially in Europe. Defenders of the practice cite privacy concerns and the impact of ads on a device's performance/battery life, while critics argue publishers of free/ad-supported content are being deprived of their livelihoods.

Russia's competition watchdog has ruled Google (GOOG -0.5%, GOOGL -0.5%) violated competition rules, and has ordered the company to stop abusing its ""dominant"" market position.
Against a backdrop of high political tensions, Russian regulators have been probing Google's required bundling of its apps/services on Android devices, and its alleged exclusion of rival offerings. EU regulators have been carrying out a similar probe. Google's bundling requirements are a core part of its strategy to monetize Android and keep mobile revenue-sharing payments down.
Russian search leader Yandex (YNDX +9.1%), which filed the complaint, has spiked higher. Google has been gradually taking share from Yandex: LiveInternet estimates Yandex had 57.3% of the Russian search market in Q2, down from 58.6% in Q1 and 59.7% in Q4.

Android Pay, first announced in May at Google I/O, has launched across the U.S. today. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) states the service works on any NFC-capable Android device running version 4.4 or higher, supports American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards issued by a slew of major banks/credit unions.
Android Pay works at 1M+ locales supporting tap-and-pay NFC readers. Retail partners include Walgreens, BJ's, Whole Foods, Macy's, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Panera.
With Google not collecting transaction fees for Pay - judging by the small fees collected by Apple for Apple Pay, it wouldn't be receiving much regardless - Android Pay's potential value lies in keeping Android users happy, and perhaps providing Google with purchase data that can be used for ad targeting. In addition to Apple Pay, the service competes with Samsung Pay, which supports both NFC and magnetic stripe readers, and launches in the U.S. on Sep. 28.
Separately, Google states it has added San Diego, Irvine, and Louisville to its list of cities where it's thinking of rolling out Fiber's pay-TV and gigabit broadband services.

The Information reports Google (GOOG -1.3%, GOOGL -1.4%) ""hopes to get Chinese government approval to distribute a special China version"" of Google Play as soon as this fall. The Chinese version of the App Store will comply with Beijing's censorship requirements, and store data locally.
The site previously reported of plans for a Chinese Play launch last November. Google shut down its Chinese search engine (Google.cn) in 2010 rather than comply with censorship requirements. However, the company still does plenty of business with Chinese advertisers looking to reach overseas buyers, and hosts many apps developed by Chinese firms within international Play stores.
While Android accounts for well over half of Chinese smartphone sales - Kantar Worldpanel estimates a 79.1% unit share in ""Urban China"" for the 3 months ending July - Chinese Android users generally rely on app stores from local tech giants Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU), and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY). Meanwhile, the iPhone maintains a large share among higher-income Chinese users more likely to pay for apps and/or in-app purchases.
In other Google news, Google is expanding its self-driving car tests from the company's home base of Mountain View to Austin, TX. The company has previously suggested it wants to bring a self-driving car to market by 2020, and that it wants to act as a hardware/software supplier for 3rd-party automakers.
Google claims its cars have been involved in just 16 minor accidents in over 2M miles of driving, and that none of the accidents were its fault. However, researchers think some of the accidents are a product of Google's cars being too safe, perfectly following the letter of the law in a world where many drivers don't.

Bing already offers video ads through its Rich Ad format, and Yahoo is working on its own solution.
With search ads still accounting for a giant portion of Google's profits, the payoff could be big. Video ads can drive higher conversions (product sales, sign-ups, etc.) and ad prices in some instances, and can also make search more appealing to brand advertisers who have historically opted for other online ad formats.
Such a move would also be about going where the money happens to be flowing: Online video ads are rapidly taking share from traditional display ads, as more TV ad dollars move online. Google, of course, is already well-exposed to this trend via YouTube. However, Facebook and others are also aggressively going after the opportunity.

Susquehanna launched coverage at Positive shortly before the announcement broke.
BMO's Daniel Salmon (Outperform, $770 target) joins many others in praising the improved transparency expected to result from the shakeup: ""The only complaint we heard from investors regarding last quarter?ôs earnings call was the lack of increased transparency into the business. Breaking out YouTube was a popular request and while Alphabet won?ôt do that, the move has certainly addressed the broader interest in better understanding the different components of Google...""
RBC's Mark Mahaney (Outperform, $750 target): ""We have long assumed that Google?ôs Core Advertising segment is very highly profitable ??perhaps well north of 60% EBITDA margins. The new disclosure should confirm this ...? the re-organization will likely lead to some efficiencies from a more focused management team. Finally, we believe Mr. Pichai is a logical, and strong, choice to lead the core Google platform.""
Deutsche's Ross Sandler (Buy, target hiked to $840): ""We estimate Core Businesses (Search, YouTube and Apps) at $59B in revenue in 2015, growing 14% (+21% ex-FX). This would put the Emerging Businesses segment at $763m (Figure 1). If we were to assign a 55% EBITDA margin to Core (assuming near 70% for search, the remaining below the average), that business would generate $38B in 2016 EBITDA and likely fetch at 15x multiple once investors see the stronger financial profile. Emerging contains many loss making businesses and we believe EBITDA loss could be $3B in 2016.""

Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG ... we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products--the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.""

The WSJ? and Re/code report Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is quietly distributing a new version of Google Glass to various enterprise partners ahead of a full launch later this year. Re/code adds the device's price is expected to be ""well below"" the $1,500 charged for the Explorer Edition of Glass.
The WSJ states the product is being pitched ""exclusively to businesses,"" and that a new consumer version of Glass is still ""at least a year away."" The paper suggests this decision was made by Nest CEO/former iPod chief Tony Fadell, who began overseeing Glass several months ago and (perhaps owing to his Apple pedigree) ""prefers to keep products under wraps until they are ready for consumer use.""
As previously indicated by 9to5 Google, the enterprise Glass model is foldable, contain a larger display, and have a more rugged/industrial design than the Explorer Edition. The WSJ notes the enterprise model does away with the Explorer Edition's wire-like frame in favor of a button-and-hinge system that lets it attach to a variety of glasses.

Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Project Loon has signed its first national agreement with the government of Sri Lanka, making the island nation a frontrunner in the race to provide countrywide Wi-Fi access from giant helium-filled balloons.

1498,"Google abandons Google+ requirement for YouTube, other sites","Jul. 27, 2015, 2:19 PM","

Further paring its ambitions for the platform, Google (GOOG +0.7%, GOOGL +0.6%) will no longer require users on YouTube and various other services to identify themselves with their Google+ profiles.
Google: ""People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier. But we?ôve also heard that it doesn?ôt make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use. So in the coming months, a Google Account will be all you?ôll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google ... And for people who already created Google+ profiles but don?ôt plan to use Google+ itself, we?ôll offer better options for managing and removing those public profiles.""
The company is 15 months removed from shifting resources away from Google+ (launched in 2011) to other teams, and announcing Google+ chief Vic Gundotra is leaving. More recently, Google placed its cloud photo-storage/sharing features (previously a part of Google+) into standalone Google Photos apps.
In spite of the pullbacks, and the platform's inability to challenge Facebook's social networking hegemony, Google+'s identity services and +1 button have been seen as a valuable way to gather demographic and interest data on Google users - data that could later be used for ad targeting.
Google is higher on a day many Internet stocks are posting steep losses. The Nasdaq is down 0.8%.

1499,"Upgrade, target hikes follow Google's earnings; shares up over 13%","Jul. 17, 2015, 10:42 AM","
 Axiom Securities has upgraded Google (GOOG +13.4%, GOOGL +14.8%) to Buy following the company's Q2 beat and investor-pleasing comments about spending discipline, potential capital returns, and YouTube/mobile growth. MKM has launched coverage at Buy, and plenty of other firms have hiked their targets. Google's market cap is now above $450B. 
Deutsche's Ross Sandler: ""We think this could be the dawn of a new era for shareholders. Google is showing investors that its management team (even pre-Ruth Porat) cares deeply about its stock price and talent retention.? We've long held that innovation is alive and well, and the narratives around irrelevance in mobile or share loss to Facebook that weighed on the multiple were somewhat misguided ... We have increased our 2016 EPS by 7%, and we expect the multiple to expand..."" Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju: ""YouTube is starting to contribute more meaningfully to revenue as it helped to drive acceleration in paid click growth to +30% (vs. 1Q15 25%) as well as U.S. revenue growth to 16%. Google Play was in-line with our estimate, suggesting it continues to grow at ~35% on an FX-neutral basis. As we have noted earlier, we continue to see clear indications of these two emerging business lines exerting greater impact..."" 
MKM's Rob Sanderson:  ""The growth story is very much alive. However, we think that solid expense control and discussion of disciplined capital allocation going forward were the more material drivers of the stock gains."" His list of potential long-term growth drivers includes ""mobile's ability to influence the 90% of retail transactions not online, video ad dollars migrating online, monetization of mobile apps, and new ad products.""

BMO's Daniel Salmon, who upgraded ahead of earnings yesterday: ""[W]e felt the most important elements were: 1) investor interest was piqued by comments about potential capital return when considering financing options; 2) the acceleration of YouTube metrics across the board ... 3) CBO Kordestani?ôs emphasis of the billion+ user bases for YouTube, Chrome, Android, Search, Maps, etc. sounded very much like the 'portfolio of apps' strategy/messaging that has served Facebook so well. While we tepidly stepped into this recommendation yesterday, our conviction is now much stronger...""

1500,"Google now up over 10%; cost cuts, mobile/YouTube growth discussed on CC","Jul. 16, 2015, 6:26 PM","

Google's Class A shares (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are now up 11.5% AH, and its Class C shares (NASDAQ:GOOG) up 10.7%, following the Web giant's Q2 beat. Both share classes are making new 52-week highs.
In the wake of a recent WSJ report about spending/hiring curbs, CFO Ruth Porat confirmed on the earnings call Google is now taking a more disciplined approached to spending, while adding she plans to work with Google business leaders to get more data. Google plans to direct roughly 70% of its spending towards its core business, 20% on adjacent areas, and 10% on big new ideas. (live blog)
When asked about dividends/buybacks, Porat didn't make any promises, but didn't shut the door on them either, stating her review process is still at an early stage and that capital returns have to work for the medium/long-term.
Porat and chief business officer Omid Kordestani provided plenty of positive remarks about mobile and YouTube growth. Among them: 1) YouTube ""watch time"" rose over 60% Y/Y in Q2 - its fastest growth rate in two years - with mobile viewing more than doubling. 2) The average YouTube mobile session lasts about 40 minutes, and the number of advertisers on YouTube is up 40% Y/Y.? 3) Mobile searches now exceed PC searches in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. 4) Google has indexed 50B search links within mobile apps.
As was the case on the Q1 CC, Google argues ad prices (CPCs) are being pressured more by YouTube ad growth than mobile. Without giving specific numbers, Porat noted mobile ad prices continue rising, and that PC prices aren't declining.

1501,"Google jumps on Q2 beat; paid click growth, lower TAC provide a lift","Jul. 16, 2015, 4:26 PM","

While Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Q2 revenue slightly missed estimates when factoring traffic acquisitions costs (TAC), its ex-TAC revenue of $14.35B was slightly above a $14.3B consensus. The reason: TAC fell to 21% of ad revenue from Q1's 22% and Q2 2014's 23%. That also, of course, helped EPS beat estimates.

Paid clicks: With the help of mobile, YouTube, and product listing ads, paid clicks rose 7% Q/Q and 18% Y/Y; annual growth accelerated from Q1's 13%. Clicks on Google sites +30% Y/Y; clicks on other sites -9% (hurt by quality-control efforts and perhaps also Facebook).

Ad prices: YouTube/smartphone ad growth and forex continue affecting cost per click (CPC): It fell 4% Q/Q and 11% Y/Y, after dropping 7% Y/Y in Q1. Google sites CPC -16% Y/Y; CPC on other sites -3%.

Segment performance/forex: Google sites ad revenue +13% Y/Y to $12.4B. Ad revenue on other sites +2% to $3.6B. Other revenue (Google Play, Nexus hardware, etc.) +17% to $1.7B. Revenue growth would've been 18% Y/Y if not for forex, instead of the reported 11%. $471M worth of forex hedging gains were recorded.

Spending/cash flow: Operating expenses were 36% of revenue vs. 35% in Q1 and a year ago. Cost of revenue (exc. TAC) was 18% of revenue vs. 17% in Q1 and 18% a year ago. Notably, capex fell to $2.52B from Q1's $2.93B and Q2 2014's $2.65B. That helped free cash flow rise 50% Y/Y to $4.47B.
Google ended Q2 with 57,148 employees (+3% Q/Q), $69.8B in cash/investments (much of it offshore), and $5.2B in debt.

GOOG +7.1% AH to $621.00. GOOGL +7.4% to $646.53. CC at 4:30PM ET (webcast). BMO's morning upgrade is looking good.

1503,"BMO upgrades Google ahead of earnings, predicts multiple expansion","Jul. 16, 2015, 11:13 AM","

BMO's Daniel Salmon has upgraded Google (GOOG +1.5%, GOOGL +1.1%) to Outperform ahead of this afternoon's Q2 report, while setting a $670 target.
Salmon insists his upgrade isn't a call on earnings, but about ""increased confidence in upward estimate revisions in the coming quarters, anchored by stiffening margins."" He forecasts stabilizing margins and steady revenue growth will drive multiple expansion. ""That steady revenue view is underpinned by consistent (and lately underappreciated in our opinion) search growth and YouTube?ôs continued push for TV ad dollars, where we believe it still has a considerable lead over emerging competitors, in large part due to the Google Preferred program.""
Dividends/buybacks (though not expected) are seen driving potential upside, as are efforts to use Google's search data to deliver targeted ads on YouTube and other ad platforms. Regulatory probes and the potential margin impact of moonshot projects (self-driving cars, Glass, etc.) are viewed as risks.
The upgrade comes a day after Google announced (confirming recent reports) it's rolling out a mobile buy button and on-site checkout option (referred to as Purchases on Google), along with other mobile search features meant to improve e-commerce ad conversions (and by doing so, increase mobile ad prices).

New Google (GOOG +3.3%, GOOGL +2.9%) CFO Ruth Porat is ""involved in an internal audit examining costs, revenue and accounting systems,"" the WSJ reports ahead of the Web giant's Thursday Q2 report.
The WSJ also states Google execs are now selecting which teams are allowed to hire new workers - in prior years, teams assumed they could add new staff each year. Moreover, travel, supplies, and events ""all require more justification or approvals than in the past,"" according to two sources.
Google's Q1 numbers already suggested the company is slowing down its oft-criticized spending pace: Operating expenses fell to 35% of revenue from 37% in Q4 and Q1 2014. Capex still rose 25% Y/Y to $2.93B.
Also: Cowen's John Blackledge is out with a bullish note. He reports U.S. search marketing firm EliteSEM saw its clients' Google ad spend rise 15%-20% Y/Y in Q2, as strong mobile ad growth offset ""flattish"" PC spending. Blackledge: ""Despite declining Desktop search volumes, paid clicks are still doing very well as Google continues to innovate and improve overall conversion."" He predicts mobile ad prices will reach parity with PC prices ""at some point in 2016.""
Google is one of the better large-cap tech performers on a day the Nasdaq is up 0.8%. Class A shares (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are up 11% YTD; Class C shares (NASDAQ:GOOG) are up 7%.

1505,"Google +2.5%; Credit Suisse sets $700 target, cites YouTube/Google Play","Jul. 10, 2015, 1:19 PM","

Believing YouTube and Google Play will make up 15% of the company's 2015 gross revenue (up from just 4% in 2010) and grow to 24% by 2020, Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju has hiked his Google (GOOG, GOOGL) target by $10 to $700, while reiterating an Outperform.
Ju respectively forecasts 2015 YouTube and Play gross revenue of $6B and $5.1B in 2015, and ~$16B and ~$14B in 2020, with margins/profitability improving as sales grow. Of note: Net revenue is much lower than gross, given YouTube provides a 55% cut to content partners and Google Play a 70% cut to developers.
He adds ""extensive checks with industry sources"" lead him to ""assume a steeper gross profit dollar growth trajectory for YouTube"" thanks to adoption of its recently-launched TrueView ad format, which lets users learn about/buy products shown in video ads. An ad-free subscription service is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, Facebook has been taking a number of steps to encroach on YouTube's turf.
Separately, The Information reports Google is working with Huawei on a next-gen Nexus phone due this fall, as well as on a Chinese app store. Local Web giants Baidu, Qihoo, and Tencent currently dominate the Chinese Android app store market. Chinese developers are able to upload apps to Google Play, but only for international distribution.

9to5 Google reports the first commercial Google Glass (NASDAQ:GOOG) model features ""a larger prism display, as well as an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Atom processor that brings better performance and moderately improved battery life."" Connectivity is provided via Bluetooth and dual-band Wi-Fi.
The site adds Google is internally referring to the Glass model as Enterprise Edition. Many businesses and institutions have come up with potential uses for Glass, even as consumer attitudes towards the product remain quite mixed, thanks in large part to the privacy concerns caused by its camera.
Still no word on the model's pricing or official launch date. It's expected to be much cheaper than the $1,500 charged for the Explorer edition of Glass, which Google stopped selling earlier this year.
A larger display could provide an ASP boost for Glass microdisplay supplier Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX). The WSJ reported last fall Intel would provide the CPU for a next-gen Glass model.

1507,"Facebook preps Suggested Videos feature, video ad revenue-sharing","Jul. 1, 2015, 7:23 PM","
 Furthering its efforts to challenge YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a video hub, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plans to roll out Suggested Videos, a feature that (using an algorithm) recommends new videos for a user to watch that are related to one just seen. The feature will be tested for ""a few months"" before fully launching.
In addition, starting in the fall, Facebook plans to give content providers such as the NBA and Fox Sports a 55% revenue cut (on par with YouTube's) for ads run against Suggested Videos. The news comes a day after Facebook began giving advertisers the option to only pay for video ads that have been watched for at least 10 seconds, and less than two months after the launch of Instant Articles, for which Facebook is allowing publishers to keep all of the ad revenue produced by their content.
With over 4B daily views for its autoplay videos and plenty of high-profile publishers sharing videos with followers, Facebook has already become a major indirect threat to YouTube, even if its video library and discovery features aren't yet comparable. In recent months, the company has begun letting users embed hosted videos on other sites, and has also added a Videos tab for Facebook Pages.
Last month, RBC predicted video ads (carry much higher per-view prices than display ads) would account for a majority of Facebook's ad revenue over the long run. Video ad tech platform LiveRail was acquired last summer.  "

AOL will handle ad inventory for MSN, Outlook Mail, Xbox, Skype, mobile apps, and other Microsoft properties. The WSJ reports ""Microsoft?ôs roughly 1,200 advertising employees ??from engineering to sales ??will be getting offer letters to join AOL.""
In addition, AOL and Microsoft have signed a 10-year search/search ad pact that will make Bing AOL's search provider, starting Jan. 1, 2016. AOL has thus far been relying on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) search. AOL's search ops had Q1 revenue of $116.4M (+19% Y/Y), and 2014 revenue of $402.6M (+4%).

The Supreme Court has ruled Oracle (ORCL -0.4%) can press claims Google (GOOG -1%) infringed its copyrights by using Java APIs within Android, turning down a request by Google to hear the case. The dispute will now return to a lower court.
Oracle has sought over $1B in damages. Though a district court jury cleared Google in 2012 of infringing 8 Oracle patents, it ruled Google infringed Oracle copyrights. A federal appeals court later declared Oracle's code is eligible for copyright protection, sending the case back to the district court. Google had appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.
Google, backed by Yahoo, Red Hat, and HP, has argued granting Oracle's code copyright protection will prevent developers from building on top of past software innovations. Oracle, backed by Microsoft, EMC, and NetApp, has accused Google of plagiarizing its code.

In addition, an ad-free version of the service is being baked into the $10/month Play Music subscription service (formerly called All Access), which supports on-demand streaming of 30M+ songs and  (via YouTube Music Key, still officially in beta) ad-free YouTube music video access.
Google: ""Our team of music experts, including the folks who created Songza, crafts each station song by song so you don?ôt have to ... you can browse our curated stations by genre, mood, decade or activity, or you can search for your favorite artist, album or song to instantly create a station of similar music.""
Spotify provides free/ad-supported playlist streams on mobile, along with ad-supported on-demand access to songs on PCs. Apple Music, which will only be available on a subscription basis, heavily emphasizes human curation.

Unconfirmed Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) buyout chatter is propelling Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) higher. In the past, shares have also risen on rumors (later shot down) that Carl Icahn has taken a stake.

Speculation that Google could bid for the microblogging platform has been around for a while. Twitter's recent selloff, search/ad integration deals with Google, and Dick Costolo's resignation have fanned the flames.
With a current market cap of $23.7B - a buyout offer might need to be above $30B - Twitter would represent a big acquisition even by Google's standards.

Update: Some more Twitter news on a busy week: The company is testing dedicated pages that ""surface and organize relevant Tweets about products and places,"" as well as ones that allow ""people and brands to create and share Twitter collections of products and places."" HBO, Nike, and Target are among the initial adopters of the latter feature. Buy buttons are supported.

 Nearly 18 months after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced it's buying leading smart thermostat/smoke detector maker Nest Labs for $3.2B, and 12 months after Nest struck a $555M deal to buy home camera maker Dropcam, Nest has refreshed its hardware and software lineup.
Among the new products: A second-gen Nest Protect smoke detector featuring a sensor that can recognize shorter wavelengths, and thus detect smoke more quickly. The Protect, which goes for $99, is also now 11% smaller and easier to install.
The Nest Cam home camera - Nest appears to be phasing out the Dropcam brand - is priced at $199 and supports Wi-Fi streams that can be remotely viewed on a PC or iOS/Android phone, and also (through a subscription service) stored in the cloud, much like the older Dropcam Pro. However, streaming resolution has been upped to 1080p from 720p, the stand has been overhauled to support more surfaces, night vision and motion detection are improved, and the product integrates with the Protect to send alerts (and let users start watching) when the Protect detects smoke.
Meanwhile, the Nest Learning Thermostat is getting a software update that adds safety/emergency alerts and an emergency shutoff feature for a home's heating/cooling systems. The Nest iOS/Android app has been updated to let users control all Nest/Dropcam devices.
Nest continues to be run by iPod ""godfather"" Tony Fadell. Fadell is now also overseeing Google's Glass development efforts.  "

YouTube Gaming provides a dedicated app and site for all of the online video giant's gaming content, whether livestreamed or previously uploaded. The service will launch this summer, beginning in the U.S. and U.K.
Over 25K games will have dedicated pages/channels sporting related video content. YouTube (GOOG -0.7%), which has over 1B monthly active users and now gets over half its video views from mobile, is looking to steal some of game livestreaming leader Twitch's thunder. Twitch was acquired by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year after reportedly holding buyout talks with Google; it had over 100M monthly viewers as of December, up from 45M a year earlier.
Separately, Google has been receiving a large amount of positive ink for Now on Tap (recently unveiled at Google I/O, ships with Android M), which lets users pull up info and content related to whatever appears on their screens (including content in 3rd-party apps) by pressing and holding the home button.
Backchannel's Steven Levy observes Now on Tap, which leverages Google's huge machine learning investments to analyze content, is effectively bringing search to apps, thereby helping address the threat posed by app usage to Google's search ad cash-cow. ""Liberated from the search box, Google wants to be your constant companion, ready with a search result whenever you ask and even when you don?ôt.""
Now on Tap could also serve as a selling point for Android, given it requires a level of hardware and OS access that Apple has never provided for iOS devices. Apple unveiled its Proactive assistant/Google Now rival earlier this week at WWDC.

Google states 7 out of 10 Android devices currently support Pay, and that 700K U.S. stores are able to accept it. (live blog)

Android M, expected later this year, will be a nuts-and-bolts OS update rather than a major overhaul. Product chief Sundar Pichai: ""We've really focused on polish and quality, we've literally solved thousands of bugs."" New features include Android Pay, better app permission controls, deep linking between apps, and custom Chrome tabs within apps.

Brillo, the Android-based IoT OS rumored to be in the pipeline, will launch in Q3. The OS is promised to be very resource-efficient, and will be accompanied by a communications software stack called Weave that lets Brillo devices easily interact with each other (as well as phones).
Google's cloud photo service (previously buried within Google+) will now be provided through a standalone Photos app; it uses machine learning to organize pictures by people, places, and things. Notably, Google will be providing free, unlimited, cloud storage for photos and videos; photo resolution is limited to 16MP, and video to 1080p.
As Apple reportedly preps a Google Now rival, Google is launching Now on Tap, a feature that brings up Now cards related to whatever is on a user's screen by long-pressing the home button. Now will also handle voice searches that take into account the content a user is viewing.
Some shared stats: 1) Android, Chrome, YouTube, and search each have over 1B monthly active users; Gmail is at 900M. 2) 17M Chromecast HDMI sticks have been sold. 3) Over 4K apps have been developed for Android Wear. 4) 35 auto brands support Android Auto.

Proactive will reportedly replace Apple's Spotlight search feature - a dedicated search bar will be included - and be placed to the left of a user's Home screen.

The service will also integrate with Apple Maps to ""display personally relevant points of interest using an augmented reality interface,"" and have a UI that ""automatically populates with content based around three key parts of iOS: Apps, Contacts, and Maps.""
Also: 1) In addition to an augmented reality view, Maps will be given a ""Browse Around Me"" button that shows points of interest on an overhead map. 2) A Siri API codenamed Breadcrumbs will be provided to 3rd-party developers; its features will be limited due to privacy concerns.
The report comes less than a year after Apple replaced Google with Bing as Spotlight's default search provider via iOS 8; Google remains the Safari browser's default provider.? Sources tell 9to5 Google's iOS traffic has dropped since the iOS 8 launch.
Other news: 1) Google announces it's updating its iOS search app (features Now) to integrate with and pull data from 3rd-party apps such as OpenTable; its Android search app already supports this. 2) During a Code Conference talk, Apple operations chief Jeff Williams states Apple Watch developers will soon be able to write native apps (iPhone app pairing is currently required) and have direct sensor access. 3) CBS CEO Les Moonves says he recently met with Apple to do a TV service deal, and that a deal will ""probably"" happen.

The Information reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) plans to launch an OS (codenamed Brillo) for embedded/wearable devices (the proverbial Internet of Things) that could power hardware featuring as little as 32MB-64MB of RAM. As one would expect, Google is deemed ""likely to release the software under the Android brand.""
Google has already launched a smartwatch OS (Android Wear), and an OS for automotive infotainment systems (Android Auto). Though gauging long-term growth is easier said than done, the number of Web-connected embedded/wearable devices is widely expected to soar in the coming years - Gartner has forecast 25B Web-connected products will be in use by 2020, up from 4.9B in 2015 and 3.8B in 2014.
Other Google news: 1) YouTube has launched TrueView, an ad format that lets users learn about/buy products shown in video ads. The solution furthers a monetization push that's set to include the launch of an ad-free subscription service. 2) Gartner estimates Chromebook sales will rise 27% Y/Y in 2015 to 7.3M; the education market (72% of 2014 sales) will remain their biggest buyer. For reference, Gartner has forecast total 2015 PC sales will amount to 306.3M.

3 months after the companies reached a deal to include tweets within Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search results, Google is adding Twitter's (TWTR +0.3%) content to its U.S. English mobile results, both via the company's mobile site and its widely-used Android/iOS search apps. PC integration and support for other countries will arrive later.
Notably, tweets appear at the top of the sample mobile search result pages shown by Google, and images attached to a tweet are shown. Google emphasizes the value of Twitter content as a real-time information source for its results - indeed, one of the sample tweets has a timestamp indicating it was published just 12 seconds before coming up in a Google search.
Twitter has turned positive following Google's announcement, after spending most of the day down slightly. The news comes as Twitter revamps the search experience on its own site to provide quick access to ""top"" tweets and filtering options for photos, videos, accounts, and news.
Last month, following its Q1 sales miss, Twitter announced a partnership with Google's DoubleClick display ad unit.

1523,"Google slashes cloud computing prices by 5%-30%, claims 40% edge","May 18, 2015, 5:12 PM","

While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has moderated the pace of its cloud infrastructure (IaaS) price cuts over the last 12 months, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't taking its foot off the pedal: Price cuts ranging from 5%-30% have been announced for its core Compute Engine computing virtual machine services.
Google claims it now has a 40% pricing edge over unnamed rival IaaS providers for many workloads - a 26% edge in list prices, plus a 14% benefit from ""customer-friendly"" pricing features such as sustained use discounting, per-minute billing, and a lack of prepaid service lock-in.
Also: Google has launched Preemptible VMs, a solution for running short-duration jobs on idle capacity at a 70% discount to regular prices (provided the capacity is available). The company suggests the option is useful for ""computationally expensive"" analytics and graphics-rendering workloads.
Google, which has tried to differentiate its cloud offerings by a focus on developer-friendly services - Amazon is still generally seen as having a lead in total features - also announced major price cuts last November. Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue rose 74% Y/Y in Q1, and that it was the market's 4th-biggest player after Amazon (towers over the space with a 29% share), Microsoft, and IBM.

1524,Google rolling out Buy buttons; European carriers eye ad-blocking software,"May 16, 2015, 5:39 PM","

In the latest example of an Internet giant trying to move activity from partner sites/apps to its own - for another recent one, see Facebook's Instant Articles launch - Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will soon roll out Buy buttons for search product ads that take users to a Google product page to complete their purchases. The WSJ reported in December Google had approached retailers about the idea.
Macy's is reportedly among the retailers talking with Google about supporting the feature, which will follow the launch of Buy buttons from Facebook and Twitter. Google will store and process payment info; retailers will still handle shipping, customer support, etc. Google is addressing retailer concerns about losing access to customer data by passing on contact info users opt to provide.
Google won't charge advertisers extra for adding a Buy button. However, it stands to profit if a faster/more convenient buying experience leads to higher conversion rates, thus compelling merchants to up their Google ad spend.
This could particularly hold true on mobile, where small screen sizes can lead to a poor shopping experience on 3rd-party sites, and drive users to make purchases via retailer apps (thus cutting Google out). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is indirectly in the crosshairs: Google has argued Amazon is its top search rival, given the greater likelihood of Amazon shoppers to go directly to its site/apps and bypass Google search.
Separately, the FT reports a European carrier looking to gain leverage against Google plans to roll out ad-blocking software (provided by Israeli startup Shine) to users this year on an opt-in basis. Several peers are also reportedly thinking of blocking ads.
The effort could run afoul of European net neutrality laws and/or spark a backlash from local advertisers and publishers - French ISP Iliad/Free was forced to stop automatically blocking ads in 2013 following government pressure. It could also lead Google and other companies whose ads are blocked to retaliate by blocking their content from being delivered to a carrier's users.

1525,Google starting road tests for self-driving car prototypes,"May 15, 2015, 12:07 PM","

""This summer, a few of the prototype vehicles we?ôve created will leave the test track and hit the familiar roads of Mountain View, Calif., with our safety drivers aboard,"" says Google (GOOG -1.3%). The announcement comes 5 months after Google, whose initial self-driving tests relied on modified 3rd-party cars, unveiled a fully functioning self-driving car prototype.
The prototypes will use the same software/algorithms as Google's fleet of modified Lexus RX450h SUVs, which have logged nearly a million miles of autonomous driving. For now, their speed will be capped at 25mph. Google is interested in ""uncovering challenges that are unique to a fully self-driving vehicle?îe.g., where it should stop if it can?ôt stop at its exact destination due to construction or congestion.""
The Web giant has said it wants to begin selling a self-driving car by 2020, and has talked with various automakers about bringing one to market (with Google acting as a hardware/software supplier). Earlier this week, Google stated its cars have been involved in just 11 minor accidents during 1.7M miles of autonomous and manual driving over 6 years, and that ""not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.""

1527,Twitter strikes Google ad deal after weak Q1,"Apr. 28, 2015, 10:29 PM","

On a day that it posted a Q1 sales miss (a little ahead of schedule) and cut its full-year guidance, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announces it's partnering with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DoubleClick unit (a giant in the display ad space) to allow Twitter advertisers using DoubleClick to ""measure when conversions result from views and other actions on Twitter.""
Notably, Twitter/DoubleClick plan to give advertisers ""a new attribution model in DoubleClick to get a fuller understanding of how Twitter Ads served on mobile or desktop drive conversions for them across the web."" That could point to the (anonymous) use of Twitter profiles to track ad conversions. Also: The companies plan to make Twitter ad inventory available through DoubleClick Bid Manager, a widely-used ad-buying platform supporting many online ad exchanges.
The addition of Twitter as a partner is a notable win for DoubleClick as it tries to fend off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which last fall launched a new version of its Atlas ad server/measurement platform that tracks the performance of ads seen by Facebook users both on its site/apps and others. Facebook is counting on its anonymous linking of user profiles with ad measurement to give it an edge against DoubleClick and other rivals relying on cookies.
Meanwhile, Twitter's Q1 CC (live blog) failed to cheer up investors. The company mentioned Q2 user growth is off to a ""slow start,"" and that ad click rates (CTRs) declined Q/Q in Q1 due to a mix shift towards formats with lower CTRs. Ad load was flat, and app install ads (a format Facebook has seen huge success with) underperformed.
On the bright side, CEO Dick Costolo noted more than 1M people signed up for Twitter's Periscope live-streaming app in its first 10 days, that the company has seen ""orders of magnitude"" more native video on its site following the launch of a 30-second video platform in January, and that it's working with Apple on a Spotlight search integration deal. CFO Anthony Noto stated Twitter will begin counting users of its SMS follow service (there are currently ~6M) as MAUs.
Twitter fell 1.6% in AH trading after dropping 18.2% in regular trading on account of its results. Shares are now at $41.58.

Thanks to a better-than-feared Q1 report that included lower-than-expected spending figures, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) rallied to its highest levels of the month today. Class C shares are now up 16% from a January low of $487.56, and 6% below a 52-week high of $599.65.
At least 6 firms have hiked their targets. Deutsche's Ross Sandler (Buy) notes net profit margin was flat in Q1 ""after imploding for three years,"" something he attributes to both cost discipline and management changes.
Looking at the top-line, Morgan Stanley (Equal-Weight) is worried U.S. revenue growth slowed to 11% Y/Y (the slowest pace since Q4 2009). With YouTube having likely grown over 40% Y/Y, MS thinks U.S. search revenue (higher-margin) was only up 9%-10%.
On the CC (transcript), CFO Patrick Pichette stated a mix shift towards YouTube ads - any un-skipped video ad is counted as a click - was pressuring Google's ad prices (CPCs), and not mobile. ""Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year."" Sales chief Omid Kordestani noted YouTube's TruView advertiser count rose 45% in 2014.
BofA/Merrill (Buy) is pleased with the CPC disclosure, as well as sales growth and margin stability. ""We continue to see opportunity for sentiment improvement on new products (I/O in May), anticipation of new CFO, spending trajectory change, and YouTube strength.
Meanwhile, eyewear maker Luxottica has announced it's working with Google on a commercial version of Google Glass that will launch soon (no ETA is given). Sales of the $1,500 Explorer Edition ended in January.
Glass chief Ivy Ross previously stated the next version will be cheaper, have a longer battery life, and a better display and sound quality. Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX) is expected to remain Glass' microdisplay supplier, and Intel is expected to be its CPU supplier. Eric Schmidt affirmed Google's commitment to Glass last month.

Much like Facebook, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 sales were hurt by a strong dollar - Y/Y growth was 12% in actual dollars, and 17% in constant currency. Google did manage to partly offset forex pressure by recording $311M in hedging gains.
Ad prices (CPCs), affected by both forex and an ongoing mix shift towards smartphone ads, fell 5% Q/Q and 7% Y/Y, after dropping 3% Y/Y in Q4. Paid clicks fell 1% Q/Q (seasonality) but rose 13% Y/Y; they were up 14% Y/Y in Q4.
Google sites revenue (69% of total revenue) +14% Y/Y to $11.9B. Revenue from ad network sites (hurt by policy changes, and perhaps also the mobile shift) +1% to $3.58B. Other revenue (Nexus hardware, Google Play, etc.) +23% to $1.75B. Paid clicks on Google sites rose 25%, while clicks on ad network sites fell 12%.
Google cooled its spending growth a bit: Operating expenses were 35% of revenue vs. 37% in Q4 and Q1 2014 - R&D spend totaled $2.75B, sales/marketing $2.07B, and G&A $1.64B. Traffic acquisition costs were 22% of revenue, even with Q4 and down from 23% a year ago.
Op. margin was 33% vs. 32% a year ago. Free cash flow was $3.69B, trailing net income of $4.53B thanks in part to a 25% Y/Y increase in capex to $2.93B. Google ended Q1 with $65.4B in cash/marketable securities (much of it offshore), and $5.2B in debt.

GOOG +1.8% AH to $557.00.

1530,"Analysts: Google's Fi service offers limited benefits for Sprint, T-Mobile","Apr. 22, 2015, 8:29 PM","
 Google's Project Fi wireless MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) service will piggyback on the networks of Sprint (S +2%) and T-Mobile (TMUS +2.2%) when it's not using Wi-Fi to route calls and data -- and while traffic is better than ""no traffic,"" analysts at Cowen and Evercore say it won't mean much benefit for the two wireless firms. Colby Synesael of Cowen says that financial gains will be limited for the two (and for Google): It's all about Google trying to shape the market in ways that might eventually pay off. The offer is ""compelling"" on price and technology and could make a monetary difference if device support grows, but it's more likely about carriers making Fi's practices mainstream, he says. On price, the data giveback and international aspects of Fi could pressure AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to follow suit, Synesael writes. Evercore's Jonathan Schildkraut found the announcement in line with expectations, though ""we also would not rule out a potential relationship between GOOG and the MSOs' Wi-Fi networks as another way to dis-intermediate the traditional carrier,"" he writes. ""Not as Bad as Expected for T and VZ. We view the higher than expected toll to get on the network ($20) as likely better for carriers than anticipated.""

1531,"Google launches Fi mobile service - $20/month for voice/text, $10 per GB","Apr. 22, 2015, 2:07 PM","

As rumored, Google's (GOOG +1.1%) anticipated U.S. mobile service has launched today with the help of network partners Sprint (S +1.7%) and T-Mobile (TMUS +2.2%). Also as rumored, Google is pricing aggressively and providing free roaming for the service, which is known as Project Fi.
Google is charging just $20/month for voice, SMS, Wi-Fi tethering, and international roaming in 120+ countries. Each GB of data (also comes with roaming) costs an extra $10/month; notably, any unused data is refunded. Users automatically connect to more than 1M Wi-Fi hotspots when they're available, and rely on Sprint/T-Mobile's 4G networks when they're not.
The big catch (also as expected): The service is only available for now via Motorola Mobility's huge Nexus 6 phablet (6"" 2K display). iPhone owners and those preferring smaller Android phones are out of luck. That limits the near-term threat posed to U.S. carriers by Fi, which (as the Nexus line does for hardware) aims to showcase Google's vision of what mobile services should be like.
Also: Much like many Google Web services launching in beta, Fi is launching as an invite-only service. U.S. consumers can request an invite on Google's Fi site.

 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is ready to push out its wireless phone service as soon as tomorrow, the WSJ reports, and it's expected to allow customers to pay only for data used. That could put pressure on existing providers who have pocketed excess fees spent on data ""buckets"" that typically waste a reported $28/month per subscriber. As previously reported, the service will work only on Google's latest Nexus 6 devices and will use Wi-Fi nets to route calls and data. Wireless service will be via Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) networks, switching between them depending on stronger signal. The deal represents a threat to the wireless status quo, even as transit agreements are good for Sprint and T-Mobile. The decision in Sprint's case to go along reportedly went all the way to Chairman Masayoshi Son.

What could have been: With Tesla (TSLA -0.5%) in dire straits in March 2013 as the company struggled to fix Model S bugs and convert pre-orders into actual sales, Elon Musk reached out to Larry Page and ""proposed that Google (GOOG +1.6%) buy Tesla outright,"" Bloomberg's Ashlee Vance reports through an excerpt from a Musk book due out on May 19.
Vance adds Tesla would've cost Google $6B at the time after factoring ""a healthy premium"" - Tesla's market cap is currently $25.9B. As part of the deal, Musk wanted Google to promise to invest $5B in factory expansions and let Musk run Tesla for 8 years, until it was ready to launch a mass-market car.
While ""Musk, Page, and Google?ôs lawyers negotiated the specific terms of the deal"" in the following weeks, Tesla's Model S sales began to take off, and the company posted its first profit and repaid its DOE loan. No longer needing a white knight, Musk broke off talks.
A $6B Tesla acquisition would've been one of Google's largest, surpassed in size only by Motorola Mobility. Google, of course, has kept pushing ahead with its self-driving car efforts since 2013; the company has said it's talking with GM, Ford, Toyota, and others about bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. Tesla has some interest in this space as well.

Following an NYT column featuring remarks from exec Bill Hilf that that were taken to suggest HP (NYSE:HPQ) is exiting the public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, HP has told CRN it remains committed to the space. However, the IT giant adds (echoing Hilf's remarks) it's ""not competing head-to-head with the big public cloud players,"" such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
HP's comments follow the February departure of top cloud exec Marten Mickos (joined via the Eucalyptus acquisition), and the splitting of his responsibilities between Hilf and two other execs. The company entered the public cloud market in 2012, and (like many other enterprise IT firms) has been a backer of the OpenStack IaaS platform (pitched as an open-source alternative to Amazon/Google/Microsoft's proprietary offerings). HP asserts it has the largest OpenStack public cloud in existence.
HP's stance arguably highlights the challenges traditional enterprise IT names face in countering the cost and scale advantages possessed by IaaS market leaders, who have often eschewed the hardware of IT giants in favor of cheap white-label hardware produced by Asian contract manufacturers. HP has partnered with Taiwan's Foxconnn and Accton to offer white-box gear for cloud providers.
Synergy Research estimates the broader ""cloud infrastructure service"" market (covers IaaS and PaaS, as well as private and hybrid clouds) grew 48% in 2014 to $16B, as more on-premise workloads get migrated to cloud environments and various cloud service providers relying on IaaS/PaaS infrastructures see rapid growth.

After stating last fall it's considering an ad-free YouTube subscription service, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has confirmed its plans to offer one through an e-mail sent to content providers. No ETA has been given; Bloomberg reports the service might launch later this year.
Content providers will collectively get a 55% share of monthly subscription revenue, with a specific provider's cut based on its viewing/watchtime share for ""all or a subset"" of the service's content. Content providers have historically received a 55% cut on ad revenue produced by their material.
With over 1B monthly active users, getting just 5% of YouTube's base to pay $8/month (on par with Netflix's grandfathered pricing) to go ad-free could yield over $4.8B/year in gross revenue (over $2.2B/year net). That would top the $4B in gross revenue YouTube reportedly brought in last year.
The planned ad-free service is separate from YouTube Music Key, which provides both YouTube music videos and audio-only music streams ad-free. Key remains in trial mode and is expected to cost $10/month following a promo period.

IDC estimates Chrome OS, whose success has been the matter of much debate, accounted for 3.5% of 2014 global PC shipments and 29.9% of U.S. education market shipments.
Separately, Google has launched new app install ad options for Android developers looking to promote their apps. Ads can now appear on the Google Display Network (supported by 2M publisher sites), and support for in-app ads has been expanded to include video ads.
Google already shows app install ads in mobile search results, as well as through its AdMob unit's display ad network and (more recently) within Google Play. Facebook, which still leads the market, recently announced it had driven over 1M downloads through its app install ads.

1546,Zuckerberg downplays Facebook/Google rivalry,"Mar. 26, 2015, 6:59 PM","

Though Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are squaring off more than ever following yesterday's Facebook F8 conference product launches, none of it is intentional, insists Mark Zuckerberg in a Wired?interview.
Zuck: ""To the extent that we are doing measurement and Google did measurement, that?ôs just because Google is smart and they also realize that measurement is valuable ... Same on the video front ... we are not thinking about how we are competing with YouTube. We are thinking about how are we going to make it more useful for people to share stuff on Facebook.""
Facebook's launch of a mobile ad exchange (competes against Google's DoubleClick, leverages Facebook data) and embedded video support (YouTube dominates video embeds) has led to more than a few headlines declaring Facebook is out to take Google's lunch. The companies already compete in multiple ad markets.
On the mobile ad exchange front, at least, the competitive overlap might be less than some think. As Foreester's Jim Nail observes, DoubleClick's exchange, much like Google search, focuses on intent-based advertising (i.e. ads for items users have recently expressed interest in), while Facebook's natural strength is targeting based on a user's historical likes.
Other Facebook F8 news: 1) Facebook has provided details about Aquila, a solar-powered drone that will have a wingspan similar to a Boeing 767, and be used lasers to beam Web access to underserved regions. Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace last year. 2) Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash promises big things for virtual reality, once tech challenges are resolved. ""Virtual reality -- done right -- truly is reality as far as the observer is concerned ... It's clear that VR has the potential to change almost everything about the way we live.""

Continuing its flurry of F8 conference announcements, Facebook (FB -2.5%) states publishers will now be able to embed videos on other sites; all they have to do is click on an ""embed"" button and copy/paste some code. The move makes Facebook a bigger threat to YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG); it's already a major indirect rival to the online video giant.
Confirming a recent Bloomberg report, Facebook is launching (via its LiveRail video ad unit) a mobile ad exchange that lets 3rd-party publishers sell both display and video ads with the help of Facebook data. The solution takes aim at Google's DoubleClick and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) MoPub units.
Facebook's Parse mobile developer tool unit has launched SDKs for creating apps that run on embedded/wearable devices (the proverbial Internet of Things). Meanwhile, Facebook proper is showing off Analytics for Apps,a dashboard that provides stats on how a Facebook-enabled app is being used (and who's using it) across multiple platforms; the solution includes tools for measuring ad performance.
Disclosed: 1) Native ad formats account for over half of all Facebook Audience Network (mobile ad network, launched last year) ads. 2) Over 400K developers now use Parse's tools. 3) Over 1B apps have now been installed via Facebook's app install ads.
After getting a brief bounce, Facebook has sold off to new intraday lows. The Nasdaq is now down 1.9%.

Though there have been plenty of breathless headlines declaring Glass a failure following Google's (GOOG - unchanged) decision to stop selling the $1,500 Explorer Edition of its display glasses, Eric Schmidt has reiterated his company's commitment to the platform.
Schmidt: ""[Glass] is a big and very fundamental platform for Google ... We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn?ôt true ... That?ôs like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it?ôs not driving me around now.""
In tandem with the end of Explorer Edition sales, Google has put Nest Labs CEO/ex-iPod chief Tony Fadell in charge of Glass strategy. Former marketing exec Ivy Ross still directly oversees Glass, which has had its share of bad PR.
While the initial consumer reception for Glass hasn't gone as planned, plenty of businesses/institutions have come up with use cases, and a healthy number of Glass apps have been developed. The WSJ has reported a new Glass model (likely featuring a much lower price point) is expected later this year. Himax (HIMX -0.4%) is expected to remain Glass' microdisplay supplier
Separately, Google has begun testing Fiber TV ads that can be targeted based on ""geography, the type of program being shown (eg, sports or news), or viewing history."" Users can opt out of seeing ads based on viewing history.
The effort could deliver a level of personalization that can't be provided by traditional TV ads, and also better measurement than Nielsen's (NLSN) widely-used ratings system. Of course, Google's success in penetrating the broader TV ad market (worth ~$70B/year in the U.S. alone) will depend on offering solutions that can work with (and are adopted by) 3rd-party pay-TV providers.

The 3G-only Lumia 430 is Microsoft's (MSFT +1.4%) cheapest Windows Phone to date. It has a 4"" 800x480 display and 8GB of storage, runs on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) low-end Snapdragon 200 processor (dual-core, 1.2GHz.), and contains a 2MP rear camera to go with a VGA front camera.
The 430, which goes on sale in April, also supports dual SIMs (important for emerging markets) and comes with up to 30GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its unveiling arrives three weeks after Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 640 and 640XL, and four months after it launched the low-end Lumia 535 (5"" display and 3G-only, starts at ??10).
Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4. While costlier Lumias have struggled to gain ground against the iPhone and high-end Android hardware (thanks in part to iOS/Android's app support edge), cheaper models have fared well in many cost-sensitive emerging markets. The 430 aims to significantly lower the cost edge the cheapest Android devices still have.

1551,Self-driving cars vs. the law,"Mar. 20, 2015, 11:10 AM","
 A self-driving car from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be considered legal in 45 states at the moment, according to analysis from Wired. That 90% ratio is expected to change. The self-driving issue is likely to be teed up politicians and regulators over the next year as Tesla's new software update pushes up the timetable on the autonomous car concept.
In Germany, for example, an explicit ban exists on autonomous driving. Another riveting puzzle: How does the software code get tested? There's also the question of what the insurance industry will have to say about the burgeoning technology and how much advanced sensor components will cost. Automobile experts think some functions such as self-parking, car retrieval features, and collision prevention technology will be approved federally and locally - while the full Muskonian dream may be a reach. BMW (BAMXY), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Audi (VLKAY), Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF), and Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) are the other companies/brands out in front with self-driving car development.
The Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU) are mainly just kicking the tires on the concept.

1552,Intel scores Tag Heuer watch design win; IBM OpenPower servers arrive,"Mar. 19, 2015, 10:05 AM","

With Apple Watch set to ship next month, leading high-end Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer plans to launch a watch that runs on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear platform, and is powered by an Intel (INTC +0.1%) CPU.
The PR provides few details about the watch, but Reuters reports the product will be a version of Tag's bestselling Carrera line, and launch next autumn. With Carerra watches often priced above $2K, the deal will likely be more valuable to Intel as a reference win - the vast majority of early smartwatch launches have involved ARM-based CPUs - than as a revenue-generator.
Intel is going after the wearables market by pitching its Atom CPUs for relatively powerful devices, and its tiny Quark CPUs for less resource-hungry products where battery life is a priority. It has also launched Curie, a button-sized module containing a Quark CPU, flash memory, Bluetooth radio, and sensor hub. The company has a partnership with eyewear giant Luxottica, and has reportedly landed a design win for the next version of Google Glass.
Separately, IBM (IBM +0.2%) has announced the first OpenPower servers - servers running on IBM's Power CPUs (compete against Intel's Xeon line), but which can be made by 3rd-party OEMs and could sell for much less than IBM's Power-based servers historically have - will launch in Q2 and be sold by Taiwanese manufacturer Tyan. IBM plans to offer its own OpenPower servers later this year in partnership with Taiwan's Wistron; they'll be aimed at the high-performance computing (HPC) market.
Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, and Rackspace are among the companies that have given their support to OpenPower. IBM is both hoping to halt Power's long-term share losses to Intel, and grab a bigger share of an Internet/white-box server market (dominated by Intel systems) that accounts for a large and growing portion of global server spend.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has ""assembled a team of engineers to build a version of the Android operating system to power virtual-reality applications,"" two sources tell the WSJ. ""Tens of engineers"" are said to be working on the project, which was launched in the wake of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) $2B 2014 acquisition of early VR hardware/software leader Oculus.
The report comes as industry investments in VR platforms accelerate rapidly. In addition to Facebook/Oculus, Sony, HTC, and multiple startups have projects in various stages of development. Sony just promised its gaming-focused Morpheus VR headset would launch in 1H16; HTC showed off its Vive headset at the Mobile World Congress.
Last year, Google launched Cardboard, a cheap prototype kit meant to get developers to start writing VR apps for Android. Oculus, meanwhile, has partnered with Samsung to launch the Gear VR, a headset line that relies on Samsung (Android) phones to provide the device's display and camera; a full commercial launch is expected later this year. Oculus has also bought multiple startups to help maintain its tech lead.
""Virtual reality is bigger than gaming,"" Oculus CTO John Carmack proclaimed at this week's Game Developers Conference (GDC). Mark Zuckerberg at the time of the Oculus deal announcement: ""Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles ... Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.'
GPU leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD are also going after the opportunity: Nvidia used GDC to show off several VR game demos powered by its GPUs; its Maxwell GPU line has already been optimized for VR. AMD used GDC to launch LiquidVR, a VR developer SDK for its GPUs that improves head-tracking and reduces latency/stuttering, and by doing so aims to eliminate motion sickness (still a common user complaint).

The WSJ reports Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) U.S. mobile phone service will initially feature just one phone - the mammoth Nexus 6 phablet, originally designed by Google and made by Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) Motorola Mobility unit. iPhone fans are out of luck, as are those who prefer more modestly-sized Android hardware.
The paper adds the service might launch by month's end. As previously rumored, it will rely on Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) networks, along with Wi-Fi hotspots.
For those curious, the Nexus 6 has a 6"" quad-HD (2560x1440) OLED display, a 13MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, 4K video recording support, and a large f/2.0 aperture, and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) high-end Snapdragon 805 processor (quad-core, 2.7GHz.). Naturally, it runs on an unmodified version of Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
The report suggests Google will try to avoid ruffling the feathers of its U.S. carrier partners by limiting the amount of hardware supported by its phone service ... and that it will have it act as a showcase for what it thinks mobile services should be like (as suggested by Sundar Pichai) by offering the services through its favorite devices.
Separately, Google has launched its long-rumored U.S. car insurance shopping site in California (more states will come later). Google asserts the site, known as Google Compare, can provide price quotes for various providers in ""as little as 5 minutes.""

Ma's alleged comments: ""The acquisition of Yahoo is something I worked [on] a couple of years ago, this is a political problem, not an economic problem, Yahoo is a media [company], more sensitive.""

Bloomberg reports Facebook (FB +0.8%) is working on a mobile ad platform for 3rd-party apps that would compete against Twitter's (TWTR -2%) popular MoPub mobile ad server/exchange platform for publishers. Twitter is lower following the news.
Bloomberg adds Facebook could unveil the offering at its annual f8 developer's conference (March 25-26), and might also make several other ad announcements at the time.
Facebook used last year's f8 conference to launch its Audience Network, which allows advertisers to sell ads on 3rd-party apps while leveraging Facebook data and targeting tools. The company later launched a revamped version of its Atlas ad-serving/measurement platform that links measurement of both Facebook and non-Facebook ads to user profiles.
Whereas Audience Network provides a set of Facebook ad units for publishers and advertisers, MoPub is a publisher-centric (i.e. supply-side) platform that gives developers a variety of tools (and access to many ad-buying platforms) for monetizing their ad inventory. Thus, creating a MoPub rival would represent an expansion of Facebook's efforts to act as an ad partner for app publishers.

Google is a year removed from putting former ad product chief Susan Wojcicki in charge of YouTube, with an eye towards improving monetization. YouTube, which is facing growing indirect competition from Facebook and Twitter, has been aggressively courting TV/brand advertisers and hatching plans to offer an ad-free subscription service. A music subscription service (Music Key) remains in trial mode.
Ars Technica reports Google will reveal Android Pay, an API for 3rd-party mobile developers that allows them to add both online and in-store payments support, at its May I/O conference. Android Pay is said to integrate with the consumer-facing Google Wallet, which just received the support of AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.
Consumers would be able to link Wallet accounts with apps supporting Android Pay. Ars: ""[T]he advantage [to Android Pay] would be that customers don?ôt need to go through Google Wallet if they prefer not to, and third-party merchants will have an open platform API to drop into their apps.""
Android for Work, an enterprise platform that separates personal and work apps/data, has officially launched 8 months after being unveiled at I/O. Among other things, the platform includes data encryption, app security, device/app management, and file-collaboration tools.
A slew of enterprise software firms, including BlackBerry (previous), Salesforce, VMware, SAP, Box, and Citrix, are backing Android for Work. Google is hoping the platform will help address lingering enterprise fears about Android's security, and by doing so put a dent into iOS' outsized share of enterprise activations.

The Web giant is also ""acquiring some exciting technology and intellectual property"" from the carriers' Softcard payments JV, which never fully got off the ground.
TechCrunch reported of Google's interest in Softcard last month. Thus far, Wallet's adoption has been hurt by limited support from carriers - Sprint was the only major U.S. backer - and retailers, as well as consumer reluctance to embrace NFC-based payments. However, the launch of (NFC-based) Apple Pay, along with the broader rollout of NFC-capable terminals and chip-and-PIN payment systems (they make card swipes a little less convenient) is altering the landscape.
The deal comes a few days after top Android OEM Samsung announced it's buying LoopPay, creator of a mobile payments solution that works with standard card-swipe terminals.
Mobile payments plays include NFC reader maker On Track Innovations (OTIV -5.7%) and payment-processing/telemetry services provider USA Technologies (USAT -2.7%).

Despite investing $258M in Uber in August 2013, Bloomberg has reported that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is preparing to offer its own ride-hailing service, which will most likely be in conjunction with its driverless car project.
However, WSJ sources say the news has ""been blown out of proportion."" A Google engineer has been merely ""testing an internal app that helps Google employees carpool to work"" which is not ""associated with the company?ôs driverless cars program.""
Google itself announced in a cryptic tweet following the report, ""We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.""
Note: Uber's CEO has long had an interest in self-driving cars. Uber and Carnegie Mellon University announced a strategic partnership yesterday to develop driverless car and mapping technology, although it's not clear if the CMU deal will involve developing a full-blown car.

1570,TubeMogul slides after StreetSweeper brings up Google/Mondelez deal,"Jan. 30, 2015, 5:30 PM","

Though it had previously struck a deal to use TubeMogul's (NASDAQ:TUBE) video ad-buying platform, snack food giant Mondelez partly opted to use Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) rival DoubleClick Bid Manager platform to run YouTube campaigns following ""contentious behind-the-scenes negotiations,"" TheStreetSweeper reports. Google is believed to have used YouTube's TrueView ad system as leverage.
An analyst talking with TheStreetSweeper: ""It?ôs clear Tube?ôs technology is nothing special, since Google did this. And besides Google, there?ôs a lot of other companies that could do the same.""
TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson has argued the Google/Mondelez deal is a positive for the online video ad industry at-large, and stated TubeMogul still thinks it ""will continue to be used as Mondelez's software for brand advertising and will be the pipes, if you will, to facilitate any of their publisher buys Google or otherwise.""
In addition to the Mondelez deal, TheStreetSweeper cites strong insider selling from CTO Adam Rose (through an automatic trading plan) and steep multiples relative to peers Rocket Fuel and YuMe as reasons to be bearish on TubeMogul. Worth noting: TubeMogul's Y/Y sales growth (112% in Q3) is much stronger than that of either of the cited peers.
Shares fell 4.5% in regular trading. Q4 results arrive on Feb. 26.

1572,VMware gets access to Google cloud services,"Jan. 30, 2015, 1:46 AM","

VMware (NYSE:VMW) has struck a deal with public cloud rival Google to offer a slew of Google services through its vCloud Air platform. Specifically, Google's Cloud Storage service, BigQuery business intelligence query service, Cloud Datastore NoSQL (unstructured) database service, and Cloud DNS domain name service.
VMware: ""Existing vCloud Air customers will have access to the new services under their existing contracts and existing network interconnect with vCloud Air ... They?ôll use their current vCloud Air credentials to access the service and be able to use the native Google Cloud Platform APIs."" VMware and Google are also setting up a private connection between their cloud infrastructures, and working to make the Google services manageable through VMware's vRealize cloud management suite.
The deal provides a shot in the arm for vCloud Air (initially known as vCloud Hybrid), which appears to have only a modest share of a public cloud market in which Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM loom large. Several new features were rolled out for the platform last week, partly through the use of VMware's NSX SDN/network virtualization platform.
As for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), the tie-up gives it a cloud partner with tremendous enterprise reach/credibility, as it battles against Amazon/Microsoft/IBM and tries to win over businesses still wary of relying on a company best known for its consumer-facing Web services.

1573,Google: We'd repatriate offshore cash at 6.5% tax rate,"Jan. 29, 2015, 7:53 PM","

With the Senate weighing a bipartisan effort to let companies repatriate offshore cash for five years at a 6.5% rate, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CFO Patrick Pichette states on the Q4 CC the passage of such a bill would change how his company spends. He adds ~60% of Google's cash is offshore, and ~40% domestic. (CC live blogs: WSJ, BI)
Google ended Q4 with $64.4B in cash/marketable securities, and $5.2B in debt. Speculation that dividends and/or buybacks might finally happen has grown a bit lately. Pichette says Google has nothing to announce regarding capital returns, but also insists Google does care about its stock price and reviews the matter with its board.
Chief business officer Omid Kordestani states YouTube's mobile revenue more than doubled Y/Y. YouTube, which is trying hard to grab brand ad dollars from TV advertisers, has already disclosed mobile now accounts for ~40% of its global viewing time.
Other CC highlights: 1) Google saw $150M worth of forex hedging gains in Q4. If not for them, forex's revenue impact would've been above $600M. 2) Pichette suggests Google would be hiring even more employees if it could find enough qualified personnel. 3) Over $900M of Google's capex went into real estate purchases.

1574,Google -2.6%; declining ad prices and network clicks take a toll (updated),"Jan. 29, 2015, 4:29 PM","

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) paid clicks rose 14% Y/Y in Q4, a slowdown from Q3's 17% growth and Q2's 2015. Google site paid clicks rose a healthy 25%, but ad network paid clicks fell 11%. Ad quality efforts appear to have hurt the latter, and indirect competition from Facebook might have as well.
Cost per click (CPCs - ad prices) remained under pressure due to low smartphone ad prices, falling 3% Q/Q and Y/Y; Q3's Y/Y drop was 2%. Google site CPCs fell 8%; network CPCs rose 6%.
Google sites revenue (69% of total revenue) +18% Y/Y to $12.43B; Network revenue +6% to $3.72B; other revenue (Nexus devices, Google Play, etc.) +19% to $1.95B. Traffic acquisition costs fell to 22% of revenue from 24%; the ending of the Firefox deal likely helped.
Spending remains aggressive: Operating expenses rose to 37% of revenue from 32% a year earlier; R&D spend rose 45% to $2.8B, sales/marketing 25% to $2.4B; and G&A 35% to $1.6B.
Capex totaled $3.55B (equal to nearly 25% of revenue), and headcount rose by over 2K Q/Q to 53.6K. Free cash flow was $2.81B, down from $2.98B a year ago and below net income of $4.74B.
Forex hurt Q4 revenue by $541M. International sales made up 56% of revenue, even with a year ago.

Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, and Raleigh-Durham will be joining Kansas City, Austin, and Provo as markets lucky enough to be offered Google's (GOOG -2.3%) gigabit broadband/pay-TV service. 18 cities will be covered within the four metro areas.
Google suggests construction will start in a few months, after its surveyors and engineers finish designing networks. The Web giant adds it's still interested in offering Fiber in Phoenix, San Jose, San Antonio, Portland, and Salt Lake City - the five other metro areas named as potential deployment zones last February - and will provide updates later this year.
Google, hoping to compel U.S. broadband ISPs to offer faster speeds and lower prices, has promised it will be aggressive in rolling out Fiber, but has also insisted it expects to turn a profit on the business.

Two day after reporting on Google's (GOOG +2.2%) SpaceX investment (confirmed a day later), The Information reports Google (GOOG +2.2%) is getting ready to ""sell mobile phone plans directly to customers and manage their calls and mobile data over a cellular network.""
Google won't be building its own network, but will instead operate as an MVNO leveraging Sprint (S +5.8%) and T-Mobile's (TMUS +1.9%) networks. Deals for wholesale network access are reportedly on the way. Sprint and (to a lesser extent) T-Mobile have caught a bid on the report.
Becoming a U.S. mobile carrier with Sprint/T-Mobile's help risks upsetting AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), who still tower over the local telecom landscape. However, it also gives Google a chance to experiment with novel/low-cost service plans, perhaps with the hope that other carriers (in the U.S. and elsewhere) will follow suit. Google also might be betting Android is too well-entrenched at this point for AT&T and/or Verizon to respond too harshly.

Last April, The Information reported Google has discussed offering mobile services in Google Fiber markets. Q4 results arrive in eight days.

Update: The WSJ is backing up The Information's report. It adds Sprint is ""hedging its bet by putting a volume trigger into the [Google] contract that would allow the deal to be renegotiated if Google?ôs customer base swells.""

The Information reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is nearing a deal to invest in Elon Musk-founded rocket/spacecraft maker SpaceX. One source says the funding round is ""very large,"" and will assign SpaceX a $10B+ valuation.
The reported goal of the investment would be to ""support the development of SpaceX satellites that could beam low-cost Internet around the globe to billions who don?ôt have it."" Google was reported last June to be looking to spend anywhere from ~$1B to $3B+ on a satellite constellation providing Web access, and soon afterwards bought satellite imagery/analytics firm Skybox Imaging.
Musk and SpaceX, meanwhile, are just days removed from unveiling plans for an Internet venture involving hundreds of satellites traveling at a much lower orbit than most satellites (thus reducing latency). Musk: ""The speed of light is 40 percent faster in the vacuum of space than it is for fiber. The long-term potential is to be the primary means of long-distance Internet traffic and to serve people in sparsely populated areas.""
A Google/SpaceX effort would have competition: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Richard Branson's Virgin Group just agreed to invest in OneWeb, a firm that plans to launch 648 broadband-capable low-orbit satellites.
OneWeb is led by Greg Wyler, an industry vet who once worked for Google and was later rumored to be talking with Musk. Musk now asserts SpaceX has an edge on OneWeb.

TechCrunch reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is interested in acquiring Softcard, the mobile payments platform launched by AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in 2010 - it was previously known as Isis, before changing its name for obvious reasons. Though Softcard's owners have invested hundreds of millions in the venture, sources state Google's purchase price could be below $100M.
Like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Softcard relies on NFC radios to enable transactions. And like Wallet, it has struggled to get off the ground, as U.S. consumers overwhelmingly stick with card swipes. Hard data on Apple Pay usage remains limited for now.
Softcard recently laid off 60 employees. Meanwhile, it was reported in 2013 that Google had spent $300M on Wallet-related acquisitions, with little to show for it. The adoption of EMV (chip-and-PIN) readers by U.S. retailers could give NFC solutions a boost, by making card payments a little less convenient.

The WSJ reports Google is partnering with consulting giant PwC to bid on a $2B+ contract to update the DoD's electronic health records system. PwC says Google's tools could both improve the system's security and performance, and lower costs. A group featuring IBM, HP (NYSE:HPQ), and CSC has made a rival bid.
Ad tech firm Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) provides some encouraging mobile search data ahead of Google's Jan. 29 Q4 report. A Marin study found mobile accounted for 49% of Q4 U.S. search ad spend, up from 42% in Q3, and that smartphone ad click rates were 38% higher than PC rates (thanks in part to accidental clicks?). On the other hand, mobile still only accounted for 32% of conversions.

The WSJ reports Google Glass (GOOG +0.2%) will be moved out of the Google X research lab (focused on long-term projects) and turned into a standalone unit. The unit will be directly led by current Glass chief Ivy Ross (hired last May), and overseen by Nest Labs CEO/iPod ""godfather"" Tony Fadell.
The paper adds Google plans to stop selling the $1,500 Explorer Edition of Glass to individuals (but not companies/developers) on Jan. 19, as it preps for a 2015 full commercial launch involving a second-gen model (and presumably a much lower price point).
Intel was previously reported to be the CPU supplier for the second-gen version of Glass. Himax (HIMX -4.1%) is believed to remain the microdisplay supplier.
At the time of the Nest acquisition, TechCrunch reported Nest will become Google's primary hardware arm, developing many products besides smart thermostats and smoke alarms. Since then, Nest has acquired monitoring camera/cloud recording service provider Dropcam; many Dropcam employees are reportedly unhappy working under Fadell.
Separately, Google says it's talking with GM, Ford, Toyota, and other automakers about bringing self-driving cars to market by 2020. Google, which showed off a fully functional self-driving car prototype last month, has suggested it's more interested in being a systems/software provider for such vehicles rather than a manufacturer, but hasn't closed the door on the latter option.

Devitt adds Google will face stiff competition as it further expands into vertical search categories such as travel, local, and e-commerce - some of those efforts have been faring well - and echoes other analysts in arguing Facebook's growing share of digital ad spend poses a threat.
Devitt has also downgraded Priceline (PCLN -1.3%) to Hold, citing concerns about forex? - the impact of a weak euro is already well-known - high marketing spend, and growing competition. ""The online travel market continues to benefit from secular tailwinds such as mobile adoption, but we believe that shifts in the competitive landscape and macro headwinds warrant a moderate 2015 outlook.""

Nonetheless, Google's safety drivers ""will continue to oversee the vehicle for a while longer, using temporary manual controls as needed while we continue to test and learn.""

Among other things, Anmuth cites ""the transition from desktop to mobile search, continued margin compression, and increasing competition from Facebook.""
The indirect challenge posed by Facebook to Google's ad dollars was raised by some following Google's Q3 miss. Meanwhile, Facebook's Atlas (display ad-buying/measuring) and Audience Network (mobile ad network) platforms directly compete against Google's DoubleClick and AdMob units.
The ability of Google search to deliver ads directly tied to user intent (i.e. what a user is looking to buy at a particular moment) still acts as a key selling point when battling for ad dollars. Facebook's ad targeting, by contrast, is often driven by previously-obtained user data.
Shares have made new 52-week lows. Google now goes for 14x 2015E EPS exc. net cash/investments. The 2015 revenue growth consensus is at 17.7%.

Google is also said to be ""considering a [Google Shopping] marketing program that would allow merchants to promote two-day shipping."" The program would be similar to one from ShopRunner that provides unlimited two-day shipping from various retailers for $79/year. Amazon Prime, of course, provides unlimited two-day shipping (among other things) for $99/year.
Sources caution several retailers approached by Google were cool to the ""Buy"" button concept, fearing more price competition and a loss of control over the shopper experience. Google could profit from the button either by charging a transaction fee, or by simply seeing higher conversions when it's used (thus raising ad prices). The company might also get better conversion data than it's currently receiving.
As ChannelAdvisor's data drives home, Google Shopping ads (deeply integrated with Google search) have been seeing rapid growth; Wal-Mart, Best Buy, eBay, and Sears are among their many buyers. Amazon, though spending plenty on standard Google search ads, is a high-profile holdout.
Google officially launched its $95/year Shopping Express same-day/next-day delivery service (competes against Prime's same-day services) in October. Around the same time, Eric Schmidt called Amazon Google's biggest search rival, due to the fact Amazon shoppers are more likely to bypass Google search.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is shutting down its Google News service in Spain due to new legislation that will require the company to pay publishers for displaying any portion of their work.
""As Google News itself makes no money (we do not show any advertising on the site) this new approach is simply not sustainable,"" announced Richard Gingras, head of Google News.
The company will close the service on December 16 and will remove all Spanish publishers from its international versions.

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DoubleClick Ad Exchange came first in ad analytics firm Pixalate's study of the quality of the ads delivered by 400 real-time bidding (RTB) platforms. Pixalate says its analyzed 100B+ ad impressions, gauging metrics such as viewability, fraud rates, engagement, and domain masking (i.e. the disguising of the Web address an ad links to).
Google/DoubleClick, which has been gaining display ad share for a number of years, received a maximum network score (measures the quality of ad domains) of 99. It also got high marks for inventory quality (92), viewability (96), engagement (90), domain masking (96), and fraud (88).
Among publicly-traded online ad firms, The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI) was a standout, coming in at #3. Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) also fared well, ranking #15.
On the other hand, mobile ad network owner Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) was ranked #300. Millennial, bleeding mobile ad share to Google and Facebook (among others) over the last two years, is said to have a ""high ratio of fraudulent traffic.""
RTB accounts for much of the burgeoning programmatic (automated) online ad market. eMarketer forecasts the U.S. RTB market will grow 123% this year to $9.25B, and total $11.8B in 2016. The adjacent programmatic direct market (covers the automated buying of entire ad campaigns from publishers) is expected to grow over 10x from 2014 to 2016, to $8.6B.

Facebook Search (FB -0.5%) has been updated to support searching for keywords within posts, photos, and other content that has previously appeared in a user's news feed. The feature is initially launching to PC and iOS users; Android support will arrive later.
For now, Facebook doesn't plan to sell mobile search ads, or any new keyword-based ads in general. But as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can vouch, offering such ads could prove very lucrative long-term. While Facebook has a treasure trove of data about its users, it knows relatively little (compared with Google and other search engines) about what a user is interested in buying at a particular moment. Keyword searches can help change that.
Product manager Rosseau Kazi says Facebook also plans to eventually provide keyword searches for publicly-shared posts, a move that would make it a bigger indirect threat to traditional search engines. ""Facebook has a wealth of information you can?ôt get anywhere else.""
Facebook is also finally bringing Graph Search to mobile. Though launched to much fanfare in early 2013, Graph Search hasn't lived up to expectations thus far, as users found its approach to queries (for example, searching for all friends who live in Seattle who work for Starbucks) too complicated relative to standard search.
Mark Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook's commitment to Graph Search in a spring interview, while adding the product is aimed more at mobile than PCs.

1600,"Google roundup: Apps/Microsoft, brand ads, U.K. tax, kids site,","Dec. 3, 2014, 6:45 PM","


The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) plans to offer higher commissions to top-performing Google Apps resellers, hoping to put a larger dent into Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) productivity software dominance. Right now, Google has only 10K+ Apps reseller partners; Microsoft has 400K+ for Office.
Gartner estimates Google accounted for less than 1% of the productivity market's revenue in 2013, compared with Microsoft's 90%+.  Corporate familiarity/comfort with Office, together with strong uptake  for Office 365 (features both cloud and local apps, unlike Google Apps),  have stood in Google's way.
Google has run about 6,000 studies for ad clients in recent months to see if brand ads leave their intended impression on viewers, says display/video ad VP Neil Mohan. The studies are part of an aggressive push by Google to compel marketers to move more of their brand ad spend online.
Related efforts include working with Nielsen and comScore to get a better read on who's seeing a particular ad, and ensuring ad impressions are actually viewed by a person (still a challenge). YouTube is set to be a major beneficiary of the shift in brand ad spend towards digital channels.
The U.K. plans to impose a 25% tax on profits locals produced by multinationals that are shifted to tax shelters. The press is already calling the levy a ""Google tax"" - it comes amid broader EU scrutiny of the use of tax shelters by multinationals.
Google has confirmed it's launching versions of popular products, including search, YouTube, and Chrome, meant specifically for kids 12 and younger (previous). Though parental controls will be included, concerns about running afoul of FTC privacy and children's advertising rules exist. ""We expect this to be controversial, but the simple truth is kids already have the technology in schools and at home,"" says Google exec Pavni Diwanji.

The Information reports Yahoo (YHOO - unchanged) and search partner Microsoft (MSFT +0.5%) are aggressively trying to sell Apple on replacing Google (GOOG +0.6%) as the default search engine for the Safari browser (pre-installed on all iOS/Mac OS hardware) when its Google deal expires in 2015.
Apple, which naturally views Google as a major rival, already dropped Google as iOS and Mac OS' Spotlight search provider this year in favor of Bing. Yahoo, meanwhile, is less than a week removed from announcing it has displaced Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider; Google is still the default provider in Europe.
The Firefox deal suggests Google is willing to walk away from default search agreements if Yahoo/Microsoft (hungry to grow their scale) significantly undercut its revenue-sharing terms, betting much of its base will keep using Google regardless. Macquarie has estimated Google provides Apple with a 75% cut on Safari-driven iOS search ad revenue.
On iOS, users could keep relying on Google search in the event of a Yahoo deal by manually selecting Google as their Safari search option (should Yahoo become the default), or by using Google's popular search and Chrome apps. StatCounter estimates Google had a 92.2% October mobile/tablet search share to Yahoo and Bing's combined 6.5%.

Music Key will be available for free in invite-only mode for six months. Afterwards, YouTube will initially offer a promotional lifetime price of $7.99/month, and subsequently charge $9.99/month, thus matching Spotify (12.5M paid users, 50M total) and many other rivals.
Apple is reportedly trying to get music labels to agree to fee cuts that would allow it to offer a revamped Beats Music streaming service at a lower price.
The inclusion of music video support, together with YouTube's giant reach - it has 1B+ active users - should make Music Key a tougher rival to Spotify than All Access. YouTube's offering might also be a precursor to an ad-free subscription option for the entire site.

Google's (GOOG -0.3%) has once more aggressively slashed cloud infrastructure (IaaS) prices in an attempt to gain ground against 800-lb. gorilla Amazon (AMZN -1.1%). Price cuts covers SSD, database, disk snapshot, storage, and networking services, and range from 23%-79%.
Google, which likely has the most infrastructure scale of any IaaS provider (if one counts its broader Web services ops), has said it wants cloud pricing to fall at a pace equal to Moore's Law; that implies a halving every 18 months. It cut prices in March for both its core computing service (Compute Engine) and other offerings, and more recently gave Compute Engine another 10% cut.
The Web giant has also launched several new IaaS services today, with a focus on countering Amazon (widely seen as having a feature set lead) by catering to developer needs. The service getting the most attention is Container Engine, which allows users to manage and provision server clusters running Docker containers. Containers act as lightweight alternatives to virtual machines, and are quickly growing in popularity.
Also launching: 1) Three new network connectivity options meant to improve access to Google's fiber network' Amazon and Microsoft have made similar moves. 2) New features for the recently-launched Managed VM service, which combines the software flexibility of IaaS services with the ease-of-use of the App Engine cloud app (PaaS) platform. 3) Automatic resource scaling for Compute Engine virtual machines. 4) The integration of newly-acquired Firebase's mobile/Web app developer tools.
Amazon quickly responded to Google's March price cuts, and might do the same this time. Synergy Research recently estimated Amazon still had a 27% combined IaaS/PaaS share in Q3, more than twice that of any rival. Google was ranked #4, behind Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.

Needham: ""While Paid Clicks slowed, particularly in mobile, we believe Google is well positioned for the transition to mobile ...? We also expect Google to benefit from its strengthening relationship with brands. Google's efforts to prove that its online advertising attribution drives offline conversions should translate into larger ad budget allocations.""

SunTrust: ""Google continues to dominate search share and be a leader in display, video, mobile, and software applications. The network effects created powerful product extensions to provide a prolonged period of growth.""
BofA is also staying bullish, but has cut its target by $70 to $600, and voices some concerns. ""While some of the slowdown in growth is due to tougher comps, results suggest a slowing environment for Online traffic and advertising, or a competitive shift to social sites.""

Likewise, sales chief Omid Kordestani (filling in for the departed Nikesh Arora) suggested the slowdown in paid click growth is a normal fluctuation, and that swings happen from time to time as changes are made. Is Facebook a culprit? The social networking giant's ad sales rose 67% Y/Y in Q2 to $2.68B.

The Google Shopping Express same-day/next-day delivery service has been renamed to Google Express. It has also added Chicago, Boston, and D.C. to its list of supported cities; existing markets include the Bay Area, West L.A., and Manhattan. Altogether, Google (GOOG +1%) says it now provides same-day to 7M+ people, and next-day to nearly 12M Northern California residents.
The service (free on a trial basis until now) has been priced at $95/year. While that's only slightly less than Amazon Prime's (AMZN +1.2%) $99/year fee, Google charges no additional fee for same day/overnight delivery on most $15+ orders.
Amazon charges Prime subs a $5.99 flat fee for same-day orders of up to 150 pounds. Its AmazonFresh service doesn't charge a per-order fee and covers the delivery of fresh/refrigerated items, but also costs $299/year and has a $35 minimum.
Express has added 16 new merchant partners in recent months, including Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, and PetSmart. Existing partners include Whole Foods, Walgreens, and Staples.
Google's announcement comes a day after Eric Schmidt called Amazon Google's biggest search rival. Express could provide the Web giant with valuable shopping data that could help Amazon's rivals deliver better targeted ads on Google properties.

1625,"Schmidt defends Google against EU, calls Amazon biggest search rival","Oct. 13, 2014, 10:12 PM","

""Put simply, we created search for users, not websites,"" declares Eric Schmidt during a Berlin speech, defending Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) integration of its own content within search results against claims that it violates antitrust law. (transcript)
Schmidt: ""Companies like Expedia, Yelp, and TripAdvisor argue that it deprives their websites of valuable traffic and disadvantages their businesses. They?ôd rather go back to 10 blue links. What?ôs interesting is that the traffic these websites get from Google has increased significantly.""
The Google chairman also argued Amazon, rather than Bing or Yahoo, was Google's biggest search rival (previous), since Amazon shoppers often go straight to its site/apps and bypass Google search (and its ads). ""They are obviously more focused on the commerce side of the equation, but, at their roots, they are answering users??questions and searches, just as we are.""
He also noted the threat posed by mobile, where (deep linking efforts notwithstanding) users are more likely to access content by directly opening an app. ""Seven out of every eight minutes of mobile phone usage is spent within apps. And the most popular app in the world ... is Facebook, a company which now describes itself as 'the on-ramp to the Internet'."" Google, of course, has a few popular apps of its own.
Schmidt insists to regulators his company remains quite vulnerable to disruption. ""The next Google won?ôt do what Google does, just as Google didn?ôt do what AOL did.""

 YouTube's payments to media firms using its Content ID technology, which was set up in 2007 to allay fears about the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, has hit $1B. Content ID enables media companies to monitor when video they own has been uploaded onto YouTube without authorization and gives them the option to sell advertising on the content and make money from it or to have it taken down. ""The vast majority choose to monetize and track rather than block the videos,"" Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Fred von Lohmann tells the FT.

In addition, Now showed ""enhanced results"" (results featuring some kind of knowledge box/panel or structured data) 58% of the time; Siri did so 29% of the time, and Cortana 20%.
Stone Temple was also impressed with Now's ability to return complementary data and detailed results: A query of ""Burj Khalifa height"" returned (in addition to the skyscraper's height) the heights of various other buildings, and a query of ""becoming a firefighter"" returned step-by-step instructions from FireScience.org.
Now, which comes built into Google's version of Android and is available on iOS through the (well-downloaded) Google search app, both strengthens Google's mobile search position, and (to the extent the search app is used instead of Mobile Safari on iOS) lowers the company's search traffic acquisition payments to Apple.
It also could be a key differentiator for Google in the realm of wearables, where time and location-sensitive push notifications are viewed as a killer app. The recently-launched Android Wear platform features tight Google Now integration.

1629,Report: Google prepping WhatsApp rival,"Oct. 3, 2014, 10:31 AM","

India's Economic Times reports Google (GOOG +1%) is prepping a mobile messaging app meant to take on the likes of WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, and Viber. Sources state the app is likely due in 2015, and will be tested in India and other emerging markets.
The app reportedly won't require a Google login. WhatsApp has famously eschewed requiring an online user ID in favor of relying on a user's phone number and contact book. Not surprisingly, Google's app will be free; WhatsApp charges $1/year in many markets after a year of free use.
WhatsApp (600M+ monthly active users) and its peers have grown like wildfire in emerging markets (and some developed ones too) thanks to their ability to do away with SMS fees. Moreover, while WhatsApp has kept a minimalist approach to features, rivals have integrated gaming, payments, and e-commerce services, among other things.
Google's Hangouts app (integrated SMS/Gchat/VoIP/video calls) sees a decent amount of use on account of being pre-installed on many Android phones, but it hasn't done much to affect the growth of WhatsApp and other major rivals. This summer, Google bought mobile messaging startup Emu, which had developed an A.I.-based virtual assistant service for its app.
There were rumors Google was interested in WhatsApp before the Facebook deal was reached, but Google has denied making a bid.

1630,Google launches platform for interacting with smart devices,"Oct. 2, 2014, 2:40 PM","

Google's (GOOG +0.4%) new Physical Web initiative aims to let smart devices in public settings (vending machines, retail/transit kiosks, parking meters, etc.) interact with smartphone users without requiring them to first install a specific app for the device.
A Bluetooth beacon app installed on Android/iOS phones would automatically scan for nearby smart devices, and give users the option for interacting/sharing data with them. Each device would have its own Web address, thus allowing a Web page (potentially personalized) to be opened on a smartphone when a user clicks on a link in the beacon app.
Google plans to make Physical Web an open standard. The Web giant could benefit from the data it collects about user interactions and purchases, and potentially also from providing ads/promotions on the devices and their related Web pages. The initiative comes ahead of an expected explosion in the number of Web-connected embedded devices (i.e. the Internet of Things).

GigaOm observes some questions/issues remain. ""While there is huge value in people interacting with the objects around them, there is even greater value in giving objects enough intelligence to interact with each other ... Another problem is how to name the billions of connected things.""

Google (GOOG +0.5%) has been increasing the number of Google apps OEMs must pre-install on phones running the company's version of Android to ""as many as 20,"" The Information reports, citing confidential docs.
Google is also said to be requiring more apps be placed on the home screen or ""in a prominent folder,"" and that Google search be given more prominence. Affected OEMs reportedly include Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Huawei, and HTC.
The bundling of Google apps/services (especially Google search) is pivotal to Google's Android monetization strategy. Moreover, Google's ability to mandate bundling, together with Android's ~80% smartphone unit share, helps keep the company's mobile traffic acquisition costs down - the Web giant reportedly makes huge traffic acquisition payments to Apple for Mobile Safari search integration.
Regulators and OEMs haven't always been thrilled with Google's requirements. The WSJ reported in July EU regulators are likely to launch a formal probe of Google's Android licensing policies.
In January, Re/code reported Samsung had agreed (in tandem with a new patent cross-license) to tone down support for its own apps/services (often less popular than Google's) on Android phones. More recently, Samsung has been reported to be moving engineers out of its mobile software ops to other units.

By anonymously linking ad measurement to Facebook profiles, Facebook aims to once more leverage its user data for ad targeting (previous), and provide better tracking across PCs and mobile than is possible via cookies. Atlas will also feature a programmatic (automated) ad-buying interface for marketers.
As The Information reported last month, Facebook aims to use a revamped Atlas, its mobile ad network, and LiveRail's video ad platform (together with its data) to offer a full ad tech ""stack"" that can challenge Google's (GOOG -1.1%) huge DoubleClick display ad unit for the dollars of marketers buying ad inventory on 3rd-party sites/apps.
Naturally, Google hasn't been standing idly either. The company bought ad measurement platform Adometry last spring, and has been working on tools to better track cross-device and offline activity. The company has also launched an app install ad service (competes against Facebook's very popular offering) for AdWords search ads.

The firm sees YouTube's gross video ad revenue rising to $8.8B in 2017 from $3.3B in 2013.
The Information previously reported YouTube had $1.5B in 2013 net revenue (excludes revenue-sharing). Jefferies has argued YouTube is worth up to $40B, or more than Netflix ($27B market cap).

In an in-depth column, The Atlantic reports Google has carried out over 30 test flights for its drone initiative, known as Project Wing, and hopes its drones can eventually be used by its same-day delivery service to deliver products within minutes.
Google, whose effort has been ongoing for 2 years, has opted for an unconventional aircraft design called a tail-sitter. It's described as ""a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around."" By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air delivery drones rely on 8 helicopter-like propellers.
Google's drones lower products to the ground using a tether featuring ""a little bundle of electronics"" at the end. The electronics detect when a package hits the ground, and then detach and are pulled back up.

The Atlantic doesn't shy away from the fact plenty of reliability and safety questions remain, as do nuts-and-bolts hardware issues such as improving battery life and reducing noise. Google is said to be ""in the very early days of developing a mature, reliable detect-and-avoid system.""
Wing is headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy. Over the last 12 months, Google has bought leading military robot maker Boston Dynamics, solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace (meant to further Google's Web connectivity and imagery efforts), A.I. tech developer DeepMind, and hardware engineering/design firm Gecko Design.

1650,"WSJ: EU set to revisit Google settlement, probe other areas","Jul. 22, 2014, 1:17 PM","

Following intense criticism of the deal, the EU will likely revisit parts of its search antitrust settlement with Google (GOOG +1.3%), the WSJ reports. A decision on the matter is expected in September, ahead of antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia's November departure.
In addition, the EU plans to investigate Google's practices in other areas, including (most notably) its Android licensing terms for mobile OEMs. A formal Android investigation is considered likely.
The EU has already been studying the licensing terms, which require a variety of Google apps/services to be bundled with its version of Android. The bundling is pivotal to Google's Android monetization strategy.
An EU ruling freeing OEMs from having to bundle Google apps/services might not have a big impact on installation rates (given their popularity with consumers), but it could give OEMs more leverage negotiate higher traffic acquisition payments. Google is believed to make huge traffic acquisition payments to Apple in exchange for having Android act as Safari's default search engine.

9 firms have hiked their Google (GOOG, GOOGL) targets after the company reported mixed Q2 numbers, a 25% Y/Y increase in paid clicks, and a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in cost per click (CPC). BGC has upgraded shares to Buy.
""With now four quarters in a row of 20%+ Web sites revenue growth, Google?ôs search business appears to be benefiting from a virtuous cycle of audience growth and pricing power,"" gushes Canaccord ($715 PT). It sees product listing ads, Android share gains, and Google's efforts to integrate more data within search results boosting future growth.
JPMorgan sees improving CPC trends for Google sites pointing to ""more material improvements in mobile monetization, or at least that the mobile pricing gap is becoming less of a drag."" The firm's 2014 revenue estimate has been hiked, but its EPS estimate has been cut following stronger-than-expected spending.

SunTrust is a little concerned about a decline in U.S. growth to 12% and soft ad network prices (mobile is viewed as a culprit). But it's also pleased with paid click growth, and unconcerned about Nikesh Arora's pending departure. Cantor thinks the top-line numbers suggest Google ""continues to gain share both in search and display.""

Focus on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Y/Y cost per click (NYSE:CPC) figures rather than ""noisy"" Q/Q figures, says departing sales chief Nikesh Arora on the CC. The Y/Y numbers show moderating declines (-6% in Q2, -9% in Q1), as Google takes steps to boost mobile ad prices and grow demand for product listing ads (PLAs).
Arora also states Google has initiatives afoot to improve CPCs in international/emerging markets, where they tend to be well below U.S. levels (Facebook can relate). Demographics/income levels are responsible for part of the gap.
Other CC remarks: 1) Google is working with 34 cities on Fiber requirements, and has achieved major cost reductions. More Fiber announcements will arrive later in 2014. 2) PLAs are driving 3x as much traffic as a year ago. 3) ~60% of Google's cash ($61.2B at the end of Q2) is offshore. 4) Google still thinks mobile ad CPCs will eventually exceed PC CPCs, thanks to their ability to use location data and drive local/offline commerce.

The gross figure is well below the $5.6B estimated by eMarketer last fall. Nonetheless, YouTube, whose profitability has often been questioned, is said to be in the black.
The Information also reports daily viewing hours are now near 300M - up from 100M in fall 2012, but well below an ambitious 2016 target of 1B. The site makes note of the competition YouTube, still the 800-lb. gorilla of free Web video, faces from rivals ranging from Netflix to Yahoo to Facebook. Yahoo is reportedly prepping a video site, and hoping to enlist disgruntled YouTube content providers.

1661,Google reportedly committing up to $500M to challenge Amazon,"Jul. 7, 2014, 11:41 AM","

Google (GOOG -0.2%) has set aside up to $500M to bring its Shopping Express local/same-day delivery service nationwide, re/code reports.
Google hasn't confirmed the number,? but is open about its willingness to spend heavily on Shopping Express. ""You can very much expect that we are putting a lot of money into this"" says exec Tom Fallows.
Last month, Google expanded Shopping Express' reach to include overnight delivery for the whole of Northern California. Fallows says Google hasn't settled on pricing for the service, but says a sub-$100/year price wouldn't be surprising.
Amazon (AMZN -1.2%) charges $299/year for its Prime Fresh same-day service (currently in 3 cities, includes groceries). It also offers standard Prime subs in 12 cities same-day delivery for some products for a $5.99 flat fee.
Whereas Google is relying on retail partners such as Target, Whole Foods, and Staples to handle warehousing - Google's trucks pick items up from stores for delivery - Amazon is opting for a go-it-alone approach that's initially more costly/time-consuming, but could also be more efficient over the long run.
Among Google's apparent goals: Boosting sales of product listing ads by (in Fallows' words) ""closing the loop on locally available items,"" and obtaining data on consumer buying activity that could be later offered to marketers,
Google and Amazon already have a growing ad rivalry. Amazon, whose users are more likely to go directly to its site/apps to place an order (and thus bypass Google) than other online retailers, is stepping up its efforts to use its mountains of customer data to deliver targeted ads. Google, meanwhile, is expanding its arsenal of tools and services for e-commerce firms.

Google's (GOOG -0.1%) Orkut social network, a one-time Facebook rival that carved out a niche (for a while) in Brazil, India, and a few other markets, is finally getting shuttered.
As it is, Orkut hasn't seen a major update since 2012. Google's move comes as it reportedly shifts resources away from and narrows the focus of Google+, its other prominent social networking foray.

Also getting axed: Google's standalone Quickoffice mobile productivity apps. The move stems from Google's decision to integrate Quickoffice (replete with support for native Office doc editing) with Google Apps.
The Supreme Court has shot down Google's request to hear a challenge to dismiss a class-action suit alleging its Street View cars improperly collected data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. Google, which says the data collection was accidental, settled a separate Street View case last year for $7M.

Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tegra K1 processor (heavy on GPU power) will power the LG tablet. OmniVision (NASDAQ:OVTI) should supply the sensors enabling 3D vision. Ahead of the LG launch, Google will provide developers with a $1,024 reference tablet to start building apps. (video)
Google managed to show a working prototype (of sorts) at I/O for Project Ara, which seeks to enable modular phones whose parts can be mixed and matched on the fly.
Two near-term challenges: Cutting the amount of space taken up by the parts that enable modularity, and building drivers that can support a wide array of 3rd-party modules. Google previously forecast Ara phones would arrive next January.
Though it's no Oculus Rift, Google did hand out a cheap virtual reality headset prototype fittingly called Cardboard. The goal of Carboard, which has a companion app, is to get developers to start working on Android VR projects (and thus build a rival ecosystem to Oculus').
While plenty of products were launched and updated at I/O, two frequently-hyped platforms, Glass and Google+, received scant attention.

Google (GOOG -0.5%) declares Skybox's satellites ""will help keep our maps accurate with up-to-date imagery,"" and could also be used in time to ""help improve Internet access and disaster relief .""
The deal comes barely a week after the WSJ reported Google plans to spend ~$1B to $3B+ to build a satellite fleet to provide Web access to underserved regions. Skybox, for its part, has already placed an order for 13 small satellites to complement one that it's in the air and another that's set to launch.

ChannelAdvisor (ECOM -0.9%) clients saw a 28.1% Y/Y Amazon (AMZN -0.3%) same-store sales increase in May. That's up from April's 27%, and is the highest figure reported for Amazon since last June.
eBay (EBAY -0.1%), whose Marketplaces ops have been losing share to Amazon's 3rd-party services for some time, saw its same-store growth fall to 11.5% from April's 14% and March's 17.8% - auctions -11.1%, fixed-price +13%, Motors +15.6%. eBay's security breach and Google algorithm changes both appear to have taken a toll.
Same-store sales driven by search ads - mostly Google (GOOG +0.8%) AdWords - rose 11.7% Y/Y, much better than April's 4.3% - paid clicks +7%, cost per click +4%, conversion rates +7%.
Google Shopping/product listing ad sales grew 21.4%, up from 7.8% in April. Growing ad buys and a 29.3% increase in click rates offset an 18.7% drop in average order value.

1680,Report: Google in talks to buy Pandora rival Songza,"Jun. 6, 2014, 1:38 PM","


The NY Post reports Google (GOOG +0.3%) is in talks to buy streaming radio service Songza; one source reports the offer price is $15M.
Songa's Android/iOS apps offer curated radio stations based on mood and activity - Beats Music, soon to be in Apple's hands, does something similar.
The company has 5.5M active users - a base much smaller than Pandora's (P +1.2%) 77M. Pandora has dipped slightly in response to the report, but remains up on the day.
Buying Songza would provide a shot in the arm for Google's music efforts. All signs suggest the company's Spotify-like All Access music service has seen limited uptake since launching last year.
A reported YouTube music service (would feature both music videos and audio-only streaming) might fare better, if Google can reach terms with music labels.

1681,Google's mobile search ad share slips; new video ad services launched,"Jun. 5, 2014, 7:21 PM","


eMarketer estimates Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) U.S. mobile search ad sales (boosted by Enhanced Campaigns) rose 82.5% in 2013, and are set to grow 75% in 2014 and 44.1% in 2015. At the same time, Google's share of mobile search ad spend is expected to fall to 64.1% in 2015 from 68.5% last year and 82.8% in 2012.

YELP's share, however, is expected to rise to 1.6% in 2015 from 1% in 2013. 60% of the local reviews leader's searches now come from mobile.
Google's challenge: Web browsing makes up only 14% of U.S. time spent on Android/iOS devices (per Flurry), and many consumers who use Google as their Web navigation hub on PCs will jump straight to apps (such as Yelp's) on phones/tablets.
Google is trying to deal with the issue partly by deep linking - allowing its search engine to index and direct users to content within installed apps.
Meanwhile, AdAge reports Google is working hard to grow its non-YouTube video ad sales. The company has launched a program that allows top Web publishers to automate their video ad sales in exchange for a cut.
eMarketer thinks the U.S. online video ad market grew 43.5% last year to $4.15B, as TV advertisers shift more dollars to the Web.

Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Shopping Express service now provides overnight delivery for the whole of Northern California.
Orders provided by 7PM are guaranteed to arrive the next day; item prices match in-store prices. Google is providing free 6-month trial memberships until the end of June. Non-members are charged $4.99 for each store involved in an order.
Shopping Express already provides same-day delivery to the entire Bay Area (inc. San Francisco), as well as parts of L.A. and NYC. Much like eBay's same-day effort, the service relies on retail partners to handle fulfillment; the current partner list includes Target, Walgreens, Staples, and Whole Foods.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been taking a very different approach to same-day, using its own warehouses to offer same-day in 12 cities (more launches are expected).
Amazon now only charges a $5.99 flat fee to Prime subs for same-day orders up to 150 lbs, and is testing out its own delivery network in a handful of metro areas. Its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, which has been viewed as a Trojan horse meant to help the company effectively scale same-day, is currently available in L.A., S.F., and Seattle.

1683,Apple's Spotlight search dumps Google in favor of Bing,"Jun. 3, 2014, 11:11 AM","

Along with announcing a major revamp of iOS and Mac OS X's Spotlight search tool - integrated local/Web search, location-specific results, and more content-specific search options are some of the new features, Apple (AAPL +1.2%) has quietly disclosed it's dropping Google (GOOG -1.5%) as Spotlight's Web search provider in favor of Bing (MSFT -1%).
Importantly, Google remains the default search provider for Safari, which in turn acts as the default iOS/Mac OS browser. But the Spotlight switch is still a noteworthy loss for Google, given the feature's tight integration with Apple's platforms - an iOS user only has to swipe down from his/her home screen to access Spotlight, and a new search box will provide quick access for Mac OS users.
As for Bing, the deal provides a needed mobile win for a search engine estimated by StatCounter to have just a 5.48% global mobile/tablet search share as of May - 1.77% for Bing proper, 3.71% for Yahoo - to Google's 93.5%. Bing replaced Google as Siri's search engine last year.
Separately, Apple has added DuckDuckGo as a Safari search option (along with Google, Bing, and Yahoo). DuckDuckGo tries to differentiate itself by emphasizing its privacy and security features - among other things, it doesn't store IP addresses or log user info.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) plans to spend ~$1B to more than $3B to build a fleet of satellites providing Web access to unconnected and underserved regions, the WSJ reports.
Google's project will reportedly start with 180 small satellites orbiting the earth at relatively low altitudes, and is being led by the founder of satellite services startup O3b Networks.
The effort comes on the heels of Google's purchase of solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace (also aims to provide Web access to remote areas), and the launch of Project Loon, an effort to prove 3G-or-faster Web access for the planet using hot-air balloons.
Larry Page has argued balloons are cheaper and easier to deploy than satellites, but satellites offer more capacity, and have seen their costs drop sharply in recent years. Analyst Tim Farrar thinks Google will replace Loon in favor of Titan's drones, and have Titan complement a satellite network.
Google has also been reported to be close to acquiring Skybox Imaging, a provider of high-res satellite imagery and related analytics services, for ~$1B.

Android TV, a new TV/set-top platform meant to take the place of the struggling Google TV, will launch at the June 25-26 Google I/O (GOOG) conference, GigaOm reports.
Compared with Google TV, Android TV will feature a simple UI meant to enable fast access to media content. Apps will reportedly be able to provide one-click access to ""individual pieces of content"" on the home screen.
Not surprisingly, Android TV will (aided by Android's large game developer base) also support casual gaming. Google has been rumored to be working on a streaming/gaming set-top for some time.
Amazon recently launched its $99 Fire TV streaming/gaming set-top, but is charging $40 extra for a dedicated game controller. The next Apple TV is widely expected to support gaming, along with access to the content of select pay-TV providers.

Global smartphone penetration has reached 22%, well above 11% penetration for laptops and 10% penetration for desktops. Tablets are still only at 6%, and mobile phones in general at 73%. There were 2.61B global Web users at the end of 2013, and 1.79B smartphone subs.
Mobile made up 25% of Internet traffic as of May 2014, up from 15% a year ago and 10% two years ago. Asia and Africa are respectively at 37% and 38%. Mobile accounts for over 1/5 of online video time (favorable for YouTube).
Internet ad sales grew 16% last year to $116B. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) had a Q1 annualized ad ARPU of $45 (up $3 Y/Y), dwarfing Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) $7.24 (up $2.84), and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) $3.55 (up $1.58). Mobile is estimated to account for 20% of media time spent, and just 4% of ad sales. For Internet, the figures are 25% and 22%.

Moreover, David Kim, the CEO of SEO firm Wordstream, has done an analysis that suggests eBay has ""lost around 75%"" of its keyword terms from Page 1 of Google's results, and 80% of its more specific (i.e. long-tail) keyword results. Kim blames the falloff on the fact eBay's search traffic tends to involve doorway pages with ""very little content,"" rather than actual product pages. ""I?ôm surprised that Google has allowed these shenanigans to go on for so long."" He thinks Google's move has the effect of forcing eBay to buy Google's increasingly popular product listing ads (PLAs) to reach search users. eBay is already a PLA client, but (like Amazon) is less dependent on Google ads (and Google traffic in general) than many smaller e-commerce firms. The algorithm tweak follows changes to the display of Google's AdWords text search ads that lead them to blend in more with organic results, and thus potentially make them more likely to be clicked. eBay and IAC are underperforming amid Panda-related worries, but they're faring much better than RetailMeNot.

Twitch claims 45M+ monthly users, including over 1M who upload/stream videos, sometimes for widely-watched competitive events. The company claims its broadcaster count tripled in 2013, and that its average user watches 95 minutes/day.

Himax's (HIMX +5.4%) LCOS microdisplay is believed to cost $20, and Glass' titanium frame $22. A Texas Instruments OMAP4 CPU costs an estimated $8.85; with TI winding down its mobile processor sales, Google will likely go with another CPU supplier for future Glass models.
IHS' teardown doesn't account for non-manufacturing costs such as R&D, shipping, and marketing - a Google spokesman asserts Glass ""costs significantly more"" than $152 to produce.
Nonetheless, if IHS' component cost estimate is reasonably accurate, its teardown suggests Google might be able to profitably sell Glass at a sub-$300 price point following a full launch. While mass consumer adoption is still a question mark, plenty of businesses/institutions are showing interest.

Google naturally plans to offer Stackdriver's tools to developers leveraging its own cloud infrastructure and app development platforms, which received a big revamp in March. The acquisition follows the 2013 purchase of Web app server developer Talaria.
The Web giant has also bought Appetas, a startup that offers restaurants tools for quickly building mobile-friendly sites and accepting reservations/orders through them. Appetas will be shutting down its service as its team joins Google, which has invested plenty in its local ad/content offerings.
The purchases follow recent deals to acquire ad measurement tech provider Adometry and online retail analytics software firm Rangespan. Shares are lower on a down day for tech, but are faring better than those of many Internet peers.

1708,What the Google+ chief exit might mean,"Apr. 25, 2014, 9:26 AM","

""Today's news has no impact on our Google+ strategy - we have an incredibly talented team?that will continue to build great user experiences across Google+, Hangouts and Photos,"" says a GOOG representative, responding to the idea that Google+ chief Vic Gundotra's exit means the service is essentially no longer attempting to compete with the likes of Facebook and Twitter.
Techcrunch reports the Google Hangouts team will be moving to the Android team, and photos is likely to follow. ""Basically, talent will be shifting away?from the Google+ kingdom and towards Android as a platform."" It's not clear where the rest of the team will go, but Larry Page could follow the lead of Mark Zuckerberg and send the bulk of the group to mobile roles, signaling a major acceleration of mobile in general, rather than Google+.
Previously: Google+ chief leaving Google

Apple (AAPL +8.4%), Google (GOOG -0.4%), Intel (INTC - unchanged), and Adobe (ADBE -1.9%) have settled an antitrust suit accusing them of creating illegal no-hire agreements.
Terms are undisclosed for now. 64K employees had been collectively seeking $3B in damages, and antitrust rules could in theory triple that figure in the absence of a settlement.
The settlement comes after PandoDaily unearthed a slew of e-mails from Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, and others pointing to the existence of no-hire deals.
Separately, Google has denied media reports stating Glass is now publicly available. The company says it failed to edit an order page created for Glass' April 15 sale (thus giving the impression it's still available), and will be pulling the page shortly.

The WSJ reports mobile payments upstart Square, reported two months ago to have indefinitely postponed its IPO, has ""discussed a possible sale to several deeper-pocketed rivals.""
The paper adds Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) discussed buying Square this year, though it's not clear if talks are continuing. Apple and PayPal are said to have held informal talks that never progressed.

Re/code and The Information previously reported Google has shown interest in Square, which processed over $20B worth of transactions last year (largely through its mobile card readers and related apps) and could provide Google with valuable data on offline purchase activity and ad effectiveness (previous). Google's own mobile/offline payments efforts haven't lived up to expectations.
The WSJ's sources state Square had 2013 revenue of $550M, but only with a gross margin of 21% (down from 2012's 27%) after backing out processor payments and other fees. That led net loss to total ~$100M.
Square has been hatching plans to up-sell merchants on value-added software and services, but it remains very dependent on transactions for now. The company has been valued at $5B in private share sales, but public investors might now assign a lower valuation.

1711,"Google pares losses; CC touches on ad reporting, apps, spending","Apr. 16, 2014, 6:21 PM","

Going forward, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will break out its paid click and cost per click data in more detail, CFO Patrick Pichette states on the CC. Numbers for Google's reporting segments (sites, ad network, etc.) will be given in addition to a company-wide figure. (CC live blog)
The remarks come after Google reported disappointing Q1 paid click growth (-1% Q/Q and +26% Y/Y). The numbers might fuel questions about the impact mobile apps (they account for 86% of U.S. smartphone activity, per Flurry) are having on search activity. When indirectly asked about the issue, sales chief Nikesh Arora only said Google is trying to succeed in both realms.
Pichette states EPS was hurt by one-time legal and M&A expenses, and that Google's expenses would've been in-line with its targets otherwise.
Separately, re/code reports Marissa Mayer is intent on convincing Apple to abandon Google as its default iOS search provider in favor of Yahoo (YHOO). Google's dominant mindshare, together with Apple's Maps experience, might make Cupertino think twice.

1714,Google buys solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace,"Apr. 14, 2014, 2:28 PM","

Titan Aerospace, once rumored to be in Facebook's crosshairs, has been acquired by Google (GOOG +0.8%).

The Information previously reported of Google's interest in Titan. The Web giant plans to have Titan's drones (the Solara 50 and Solara 60) complement Project Loon, which aims to provide 3G-or-faster Web access via hot-air balloons to areas lacking connectivity. Google might also have Titan support its Makani unit, which is working on airborne wind turbines.
Facebook, for its part, is looking to connect offline regions with the help of its Connectivity Lab and recently-acquired U.K. drone startup Ascenta.
Titan's 20-employee team will remain at its New Mexico HQ. In addition to providing voice/data services, Titan asserts its drones will be able to collect high-res imagery and sport atmospheric sensors (possibly of value for Google Maps). It expects individual drones to support up to 1Gbps of bandwidth.
UAV maker AeroVironment (AVAV +0.7%) has turned positive on the news.

1715,Report: Google looking to use offline data to grow ad sales,"Apr. 11, 2014, 7:15 PM","


The WSJ reports Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has launched a pilot program that fuses data about a user's AdWords search ad clicks with offline purchase data from the likes of Acxiom (NYSE:ACXM) and DataLogix - those two firms are already partnering with  Facebook and Twitter.
Google's reported goal: To provide advertisers with better data about the extent online activity drives offline purchases, and in doing so motivate them to ramp their AdWords spend.
Benny Arbel, CEO of ad tech startup myThings: ""If Google can demonstrate that people did not just click on an ad but that they actually bought something, that is the Holy Grail.""
Google's effort could prove particularly helpful on mobile, where its ad prices remain relatively soft (moreso for smartphones than tablets) and users are often less likely to follow up on an ad click with an online purchase.
A recent comScore-backed survey found 78% of U.S. mobile searches for local information led to offline purchases. Moreover, comScore states ""nearly half of all service, restaurant and travel searchers were looking for a business they have never made a purchase from before.""
In addition to Google, those figures could have positive implications for YELP.

eBay (EBAY +3.1%) same-store sales rose 17.8% in March vs. 15% in February and 12.7% in January. Fixed-price sales +21.5%, auctions -10%, Motors +19.7%.
Search ad-driven same-store sales, dominated by traffic from Google's (GOOG +3%) AdWords, rose 11.2% vs. 4.3% in February and 10.3% in January. Clicks were flat due to a shift towards Google's Product Listing Ads (PLAs). Ad prices fell 7% (soft smartphone ad prices are a likely factor), click rates rose 2%, and average order value rose 5%.
PLA-driven same-store sales rose 34.5%. Though that's down from February's 48% and January's 62.8%, ChannelAdvisor chalks it up to ""a normal aging of the program,"" given PLAs only launched in late 2012.
Amazon, eBay, and Google are all posting solid gains amid a broader rebound in Internet stocks.

Google (GOOG -0.8%) has licensed hotel-booking software from Expedia-backed startup Room 77, according to a Room 77 shareholder letter obtained by Bloomberg. The startup now plans to distribute ""tens of millions of excess cash"" to investors.
Google's move points to an escalation of its efforts to compete against Priceline (PCLN -0.7%), Expedia (EXPE -2.1%), Orbitz (OWW -1.6%) and other online travel agencies. The Web giant has already launched Hotel Finder, a hotel room search engine, and Hotel Price Ads, an ad format that appears within Hotel Finder listings, Google Maps, and Google+.
Evercore recently argued Hotel Price Ads could be widely adopted by hoteliers looking to lower their dependence on travel agencies, and could benefit from their ability to leverage hotel customer data and opaque pricing.

1720,Report: Google looking to offer mobile services in Fiber markets,"Apr. 3, 2014, 11:26 AM","


The Information reports Google (GOOG, GOOGL) execs have recently ""discussed their hope to offer a full-fledged wireless service in markets where it offers Google Fiber Internet and TV service.""
Such a move wouldn't necessarily require Google to build out its own mobile network: The company could use an existing carrier's network to offer services on an MVNO basis. However, Google has quite the history of making big infrastructure investments when it sees a chance to lower costs and/or improve performance.
Google announced in February that it's thinking of bringing Fiber to nine more metro areas, including major ones such as San Jose, Phoenix, Atlanta, and San Antonio. Since then, San Antonio's city council has approved some of the infrastructure changes needed for Fiber to arrive.
Fiber is currently available in Kansas City and Provo, and will soon launch in Austin.
